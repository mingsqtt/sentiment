107939408,"Let me suggest another problem with getting people to wear masks: we're supposedly wearing them to protect others, and not ourselves. I see two problems with this statement:
A it's a lie, and
B in a country as split as this, protecting those ""other"" people, especially those too lazy to wear a mask, is not very motivating.

RE ""it's a lie"": When I purchased N95s a few years ago as I was about to insulate my attic, I wore my N95 to protect myself, not to protect the insulation. Anyone who's bought masks as a part of a hobby or home repair knows that masks protect the wearer. So once again the CDC is obfuscating, basically lying to us. I sense the reason is that the t-shirts cut into masks don't really provide much protection, so the authorities are trying a different argument. If homemade masks are not effective stopping small particles one direction, they're not going to be effective with particles moving the other direction either... Once N95s are widely available, the CDC will need to pivot once again, and tell the truth. Meanwhile cities like San Francisco are actually banning N95s with valves, the best mask you can have, since the valve is proof that the mask is for the wearer. Enough of the lies. Tell the truth, and tell us when N95s will once again be widely available.",40828043,SF,2

BUT, this is America and we are an ingenious people, make your own masks here are links to how and wear them every time you leave the house.” Instead they denigrated and belittled mask-wearing. This was a BIG mistake on par with many things our criminally negligent president has said and done. Stop pretending it was otherwise.

Wegman doesn't explain who would enforce this? If he has the police in mind, that raises the problem of police attempting to interact with people who may not want or even consent to such interaction.
The police has a history of violence. And they also have a vicious record of arresting innocent people. This is far worse for blacks or other minorities.

Wow; where to begin?

As someone scientifically educated and employed, it's clear that Castellanos is neither, so his ignorant insults, while typical of Trumpublicans, are just that---ignorant. He tries to caricature science as a church ""bow to the Gods of Data""?! because he in fact has no idea how scientific or perhaps even rational thought proceeds. A man who sees life as a zero-sum battle of verbal invective is probably incapable of imagining that other humans think and live differently.

In particular, he's probably incapable of considering that many of us regard mask-wearing as something that has nothing to do with political identity. A lifelong Independent, I have health issues that necessitate caution, but more than anything I regard mask-wearing as a matter of civic duty and concern for my fellow citizens, the exact opposite of regarding myself as ""superior"" to others.

How many times have we as individuals read this sign in a store, restaurant or other public space?  I know I’ve been reading this sign since I was old enough to read. I don’t see any protests about being asked to wear a shirt or shoes in most public spaces. The changing times suggest a new sign:
No shirt 
No shoes 
No mask 
No service",74240578,Washington,6

Who benefits from Americans being sick and impoverished by our failure to provide affordable universal healthcare?  Not the US.

107941335,"Thank you for sharing this opinion. But it may be preaching to the choir. Tragically, those opposed to mask wearing likely won’t be persuaded by this. It’s so unfortunate.

I do want to comment, however, that you’re being a too generous with those who perpetuated the early misteps. It was NEVER understanable or ok to tell people to not wear masks or to state unequivocally that they do not help prevent viral spread. Early on I suggested to everyone I knew that they should mask up with cloth and not take away precious N95 masks, not to protect themselves, but to protect others. It has been well known for years that mask wearers are less likely to spread droplets. I knew this. The health officials and experts certainly knew better. They could have, and should have, sent a simple message to wear CLOTH masks. They inexcusably cost thousands of lives.

Next, the excuse that there was insufficient evidence of asymptomatic spread also carries no water. There was no evidence it could not spread asymptomatically. In light of the supposed lack of evidence, the default should have been to mask up, not the other way around. Why? Becasue the cost of not wearing a mask and being wrong far outweighed the cost of wearing one and being wrong. Any game theorist could have told you that. 

But I agree wholeheartedly that now we all should be wearing masks.  Thank you.",74800720,San Francisco,7

Tom Friedman wrote a column the other day comparing not wearing a mask to drunk driving.  In one way, I submit it is worse.  The drunk driver can only injure or kill a limited number of people in a single crash including people not in the crash but who care deeply about the people who were.  The person who refuses to wear a mask often because ""I don't believe in masks"" seems willing to risk creating a chain of successive infections that may affect tens, hundreds, or thousands of people.

While in town, I was pleased to see the near universal donning of masks everywhere I went.  Of course, some folk do need to learn that this includes covering the nose but it's progress.

There were two distinct groups of people, though, who almost never wore masks.

The first group were construction workers.  At almost every job site I passed in Midtown none of the construction workers was wearing a mask.  This included groups gathered at non-social distances on their lunch breaks etc.

The other group was much more disturbing.  It is the NYPD officers on foot patrol in Grand Central.  While most of these cops had masks draped around their neck, none that I saw was properly wearing a mask.  All of those I saw were INSIDE the Terminal.

How can a person in legal authority ever expect to command the respect of others when he the only officers I saw were men blatantly flouts the very law he's supposed to enforce?

Police in general, and NYPD in particular, seem to be almost arrogant in their defiance of both the law and, more importantly, for the safety of others.

The NYPD has already lost much public support since the George Floyd protests.  Their collective behavior such as now refusing to wear masks when on patrol is intolerable.

The surgeon general told the public two things in late February: a stop buying masks because they won't help you and b stop buying masks because health care workers desperately need them.

While it might have been true that the medical field needed masks much more desperately than the public at large, issuing contradictory and false statements always erodes the public's belief in future official statements. 

Worse still, those with bad intentions as well as those who are only misinformed now cling to those early statements as evidence that they should ignore the sound advice that is finally being given.

If cases double every day, most people will encounter the virus in the last 24 hours. Suddenly it's everywhere, when only a short day earlier people were saying that the danger was being exaggerated.

People in areas with low infection rates are complacent today because they imagine that the pandemic will continue to grow slowly. They can't imagine what an explosion would look like, much less how quickly it appears. 

The name of the game is to slow the R number reproduction number, which is the number of people each infected person infects.  If the R number is over 1, the pandemic is growing exponentially. If it's under 1, the pandemic is slowing. We have limited tools to slow the reproduction number at present, but face masks are one such tool.

Those infected can be isolated while the rest can work and live relatively normally. By assuring that all can reduce their exposure with simple protections like medical grade masks and gloves.

So the problem is that the national government never has been able to assure adequate testing.

More than this, the evidence is that they are only used properly in medical settings. They are the least effective form of protection. Hand washing is at the top of the list.

Pushing water through a high tech spun-glass fiber, ceramic, or carbon micro-tube filter will remove bacteria and protozoans. It does not remove viruses, because they are too small. I did find a device to disable viruses in water; a water-bottle that has a rechargeable UV lamp in the cap, which destroys the virus' ability to reproduce making one liter safe in about 30 seconds.

Is the primary issue that COVID-19 can lead to viral pneumonia...as opposed to bacterial pneumonia...that obviously can’t be treated with antibiotics? Is it fear that COCID-19 produces cytokine explosion...a lethal immune system overreaction for which there is no treatment?
When the 1918 flue pandemic initially emerged in the spring of 1918 cases were initially fairly mild and while virulent...barely made a blip on the radar of the tiny public health establishment that existed at the time. Adult onset measles was a much bigger deal. It wasn’t until late summer and early fall 1918 that the truly violent and lethal “2nd wave” occurred.

We can't say this is a Republican problem, or that the president -- who undergoes testing often, I understand -- is in the same boat as untested asymptomatic youth.

The deception was to mask the lifelong severe and debilitating stammer of the king. They were afraid that stammering in that great moment would, however unfairly, “project weakness and defeat”. 

An innovative speech therapist was called in to work and rehearse with Albert, aka “Bertie”. He stood with the king in the radio booth and “conducted” him like an orchestral conductor through the speech.

Our problem is because we have no federal leadership the public is getting no consistent message that help the reluctant public accept masks. We need a media blitz that addresses the health and psychological resistance. Americans like cool. We have to make them more cool, more a fashion statement.

Second, there are no scientific studies showing that masks are effective. The literature cited by the CDC shows that COVID is transmitted through air but not that masks are effective in preventing the transmission.
Third, wearing a mask will disperse virus particles into the environment but not stop their their discharge from an infected lung. This is because masks do not seal. Especially indoors, masks are not helpful because virus particles are not trapped in mask.
Fourth, masks laden with virus particles are moved around using hands. This increases the infection risk because the particles that are trapped 50% are now dispersed on surfaces where masks are deposited and which are touched by contaminated hands.

107938136,One of the big things among many that will go down on the list of abject failures by this administration during the pandemic will be the initial dramatic denial that masks provided no protection from the virus and that people shouldn’t wear them.  It was a flat out lie and they knew they were lying when they said it.  I never bought it for a second and got much ridicule for my early mask wearing.  I also don’t buy the excuse that trying to save masks for heath care workers was a reasonable justification for telling that blatant lie.  There were better ways to do that besides endangering the entire US population.  Finally I don’t buy the notion that they only realised later that masks would be effective.  It was clear early on that this virus was being spread via the respiratory system. If people had been told in February to cover their faces how many lives would have been saved?  How much more under control would this epidemic now be?  How much less politicised would this whole thing be now?

This is consistent with a growing body of scientific consensus that mask-wearing slows the spread of Covid-19. N95 masks provided greater protection than regular face masks but that should be kept for the medical and hospital personnel who are in close contact with the patients.

Why?
The masks may not be perfect but they obviously had some degree of protection for either side, visitors or patients, if not both.
From the moment the epidemic was realized it was common sense to at least tell people to wear a bandanna or scarf to reduce the transmission rates.
Those weeks of waffling for fear people would buy out all the masks were pointless because it happened anyway and people without the sense to cobble together an alternative mask were left without guidance or options.

But I'm not just a smoker. I'm also a thoughtful human being. I limit my smoking to my apartment I live alone and use good ventilation, air filters and other measures to ensure that my non-smoking neighbors have their Freedom FROM my smoke.

In some places in the U.S., wearing a mask in public, both indoors and outdoors, is mandatory. In others it is not. But since scientific evidence and majority public opinion say that wearing a mask is vital, those who don't wear one are at the very least inconsiderate.

By late January Thailand and other countries were already preparing for the onslaught. In early February I entertained a guest from America in Thailand and Singapore. The government in Thailand was then already acting on evidence from China and other countries that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could spread via respiratory particles from people with none of the known symptoms of Covid 19. My American guest obtained a supply of N 95 masks while travelling in SE Asia. American health authorities still declared masks unessential.  What rapidly became clear was that the Americans, and to some extent Europeans, were making a political game out of the pandemic. While experts can not agree on the exact nature of symptoms, even today, how can the layman be expected to self diagnose and self isolate? The CDC's position 'Do not wear masks' represented flawed logic as well as flawed science, inspired by a huge dose of politics. The upshot is that America's death rate from Covid 19 stands at 400 times the rate in several SE Asian countries, including Thailand.

There are high degrees of difference between masks. It matters that people wear the good ones, surgical, or n-95, but without the vents- which can allow a persons air to get out and contact others.

Because I'm a member of the vulnerable population, I stayed home for a couple of months and now I occasionally go to  stores where there is no question that I can socially distance. I keep a mask in the car and put it in my pocket for if or when it is needed, but most of the time it is not, so I keep it in my pocket. I don't have a t-shirt which shouts to the world that I have reduced lung capacity and poor airflow, or that I can get out of breath if I walk through Target too fast. I just go about my business and leave everyone else alone.

Instead of fighting, why don't we try talking and listening for a change?",25070589,Lots of Places,9

There’s also the economic argument. If outbreaks can be prevented, then you can move on to reopening your economy. 

Masks are not the only solution to preventing the spread. The best thing to do is still to stay at home if you are sick, wash your hands regularly with soap and water and keep a physical distance of two meters from others. These actions are within our control as individuals.

     Ragmask.com has instructions for a simple-to-make 3-layer mask with great fit and comfort. Straps can be made from T-shirts if need be. It will still fit well if made with ear loops and the neck strap, rather than the neck and head straps. No elastic? make loops cut from stockings or socks.

Two layers of tightly-woven cotton with a shop towel filter layer has tested at 82%; 2 layers of shop towels tested at 87%; 3 layers of shop towels would likely approach N95 filtering; PLUS this Ragmask pattern fits better than an N95.

107933092,"""This is not complicated, folks.""

Actually, yes it is more complicated than one would hope, and articles like this don't actually clear things up!

Virtually every immunologist from every news story has said the risk of transmission outdoors was generally so low in the ""normal"" activities one would engage in e.g. not huge gatherings where people are stuck close together, e.g. sports, parades etc.    So the need for mask was not, and has not, seemed at all urgent or recommended just for ""going out in public.""

In this article we are told we should just ""Wear a mask in public.""  Well, what exactly does ""wearing a mask in public"" mean? 

Does it mean ""wearing a mask once you step off your property?""  Does it mean wearing it when you go for a stroll, no matter where you live and no matter if you can put plenty of physical distance between you and others?  Does it mean not really having to wear one in areas of low population density but wearing one in high population density?   All the questions readers in all sorts of different scenarios would ask are unanswered.

Our province, Ontario, in Canada at least is clear enough - wear a mask IN PUBLIC when INDOORS or in any case where physical distancing 2 meters is difficult.

But some places apparently enforce mask wearing at all times once you leave your house.  That's a big difference and a big difference in it's psychological and ergonomic effect on people.  So, I wish the author had been more precise.",78893655,Canada,26

 They could have said you don't need an N95, because that's for high level of exposure like at hospitals where staff is exposed to hundreds of patients with Covid, but you should definitely be wearing some mask.  Fauci said it can stop droplets but doesn't offer complete protection.  we'll take 70% effectiveness, which should be more than enough for most non-hospital interactions.

masks stop droplets from a wearer getting to others, and also from others coming in to the wearer.  If ""others"" are also wearing masks,  the droplets have to get through both ways to infect anyone, so if everyone wears a mask inside supermarkets and other indoor areas, the risk of getting it would have to be minuscule.

Prior to World War II, Americans were deeply divided about becoming involved. Then Pearl Harbor happened, and as if a switch had been thrown the country united to defeat the Axis. People who had adamantly opposed our participation threw themselves into the war effort.
