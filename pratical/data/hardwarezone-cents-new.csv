Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,0,"Just need the ultrabook when travelling to check emails, surf net, basic microsoft office functions etc."
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,0,More important is that the ultrabook is light and supports charging via the USB-C port.
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,0,Inclined to go for the 13/AMD Ryzen 3500U configuration since it's the most economical for my requirements.
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,0,Wondering if anyone has any thoughts or experience with the Huawei Matebook?
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,0,Not sure if the XiaoMi Laptops would be comparable or better.
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,1,I'm also considering of getting Huawei laptop
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,1,but I'm aiming at Matebook X Pro 2019 version.
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,1,"Purpose of getting this laptop is to try on the Deepin Linux OS, doing some programming testing on Linux environment and at the same time trying If without Windows can I survive, just like without Google on my phone, can I survive."
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,1,But the price seems expensive for Matebook X Pro 2019 as I want the Ram configuration is 16gb.
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,2,I molested the Huawei 13 and 14 as well as the various Xiaomi when I was in china
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,2,Hands down
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,2,I recommend the Huawei.
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,2,It's a 3:2 screen for starter.
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,2,It's way more productive than a 16:9.
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,2,The Huawei screen is matte.
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,2,Typing in the Huawei is much better.
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,3,Thanks for the input.

Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,7,Looks good enough to me.
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,8,looks yummy!
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,8,Anyone manage to see/try this in person yet?
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,9,New models
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,10,Previously can get Lenovo s540 with amd ryzen 7 for less than 900..
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,10,"if look aroubd more probably still can get it for around that price, might as well get that."
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,10,With top firing speakers some more.
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,11,"Lenovo S540 only has 1x1 WiFi, 60% sRGB screen and cannot charge through power delivery..."
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,12,"Last i checked, it was 2x2 WiFi."
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,12,"But yea, the screen is the downside."
Huawei Matebook 13,Huawei,Matebook,12,"But lenovo qc/qa more reputable than huawei,imo."

XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,31,"In fact as they become slimmer, it will start resembling a hot plate indeed."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,31,Just flip it around and you can cook something there.

XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,33,"To handle the thermal load, Dell says it has included a ""unique"" thermal design to push more airflow throughout the system."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,33,Unquote
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,34,So they say man.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,34,"I am sure they will try and improve the cooling, but physically, there is only so much they can do."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,34,"Because of the price, they may feature some vapour cooling solution on top of heatpipes to keep the machine cool."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,34,"But if there is not much space for a decently sized heatsink to absorb the heat, heat will just continue to build up in the heatpipe and vapour chamber."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,35,A 17 inch laptop with a 15 inch body is large enough to accomodate better cooling system design
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,35,lah
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,35,Quote
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,35,Advanced thermal design: The XPS 17 delivers unprecedented performance in an incredibly thin form factor.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,35,"Optional discrete graphics feature unique dual opposite outlet fans, that increase fan airflow by approximately 30% and drive cooling airflow in both directions, resulting in more airflow overall and improved skin temperatures*. Dells development of the Dual Opposite Outlet fan has resulted in multiple pending patent applications and at least one issued patent."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,35,A massive vapor chamber spans the entire width of the laptop providing even more heat dissipation capacity to help keep the laptop cool and achieve higher turbo power.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,35,Unquote
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,36,We can wait for the reviews to be out to determine.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,36,I've used a 17 inch DTR before with a quad core Intel chip few years back.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,36,This is a chunky 3+ KG laptop with 2 fairly massive heatsinks.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,36,"Back then, the power requirement on the Intel i7 3740qm are quite low under load despite the 22nm, and the chip already got very toasty, easily 85 deg to 90 degs @"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,36,a throttled clockspeed of around 2.5 to 2.7Ghz.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,36,"Now the current Intel processor you know don't stay anywhere near the 45W TDP, so even without taking the GPU into consideration, it is likely struggling to cool it."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,36,"Add the GPU into the laptop, the Max Q version of the RTX 2060 is spec to draw 65W."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,37,Reviews of engineering samples here
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,38,"Very interested in the 17 inch model, finally they change to front firing speakers and 16:10 ratio screen."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,38,Guess it'll cost 3.5k> when it comes here?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,39,Likely to hit $4K or more if you get the max specs like
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,39,17 inch 4K UHD+ screen
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,39,"Core i9-10885H 8 cores, 16MB cache CPU."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,39,Nvidia's GeForce RTX 2060 with 6GB of GDDR6 GPU.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,39,97WHr battery.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,39,64GB RAM.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,39,2TB NVMe SSD
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,40,The 17 inch is definitely the more interesting of the two
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,41,Of course lah........
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,41,big screen mah
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,41,I'm using the LG GARM 17 2020 and now NOT interested in anything smaller than a 17 inch screen leow
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,42,I think this is the one with a slower graphic card.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,43,"Whichever intel release, it is currently overshadowed by amd renoir series lol"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,43,I9 10885H
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,43,with such a thin profile.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,43,The performance take a huge dip.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,43,"With that said, the 4900H/S will take the crown instead and that should be the one to be fitted in a thin laptop instead as it isnt that power hungry."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,44,"Looking at the Tomshardware review, the lower spec XPS 15 is not managing the heat well."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,44,"In the picture where they show 2 heatpipes across both CPU and GPU, its a goner when it comes to cooling."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,44,"In the review, it was a GTX 1650Ti which is probably not as bad as having a RTX series in there."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,44,"Where they mentioned sustained clockspeed, its 3.1Ghz, higher than the base, but clearly nowhere near the boost speed for Intel to beat AMD Renoir."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,44,"Clock for clock, Intel will lag behind."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,44,"I think the result is consistent that Intel don't have the luxury of having enough power or cooling for mobile, so will lose out to AMD Renoir which seems to sustain higher clockspeed due to the superior 7nm."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,45,Exactly!
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,45,Very hard to go thin with intel.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,45,They have a ferrari but with a coolant tank leaking.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,45,Good luck to them.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,46,"I think I just want to clarify, I am not bashing Intel or thin laptops for no reason."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,46,In fact I am using an Intel Ice Lake base laptop.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,46,What I want to do is to make people aware that they are paying few grands few thousands for a laptop that is not performing as advertised.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,46,"Sure, the up to 5+ Ghz sounds amazing, but the caveat is that if it can sustain closer to the boost and not the base, yes."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,46,I rather be realistic and look at the base clock to decide which one is the better solution.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,46,"And as PC makers start selling you a new slimmer laptop, think thrice if you are looking for performance."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,47,Think better to look at the bigger 17 inch for cooling performance
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,48,Yeap.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,48,Is just that everyone needs to know about what intel is really doing.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,48,The fact that you put a high power consumption chip in a thin laptop.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,48,"Chances are, it wont perform any good."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,48,Intel be it 9th or 10th gen.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,48,They are now behind in terms of fabrication.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,48,14nm++ or 10nm vs 7nm on AMD Renoir.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,48,"It is clear that if you really wanna push Intel to 5Ghz, you need a LOT of power consumption."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,48,"In such case, most Oem brands out there locked the Intel chip power consumption so that it doesnt overheat."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,48,"And to further make sure it doesnt degrade performance further, they have to take extra measures to put more copper pipes."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,48,"Which in this case, the dell xps isnt gonna cut it."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,48,"Just one look, the Asus Zephyrus G14."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,48,A 14inch laptop managed to perform really well with the 4900HS.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,48,"It is not as thin as the XPS, but it managed to sustain boost clocks and eventually outperform the Intel i9 10885H."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,48,"With lesser heat output and power consumptions, Asus managed to put it into the tiny chassis of the Zephyrus G14."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,48,"To do that on Intel, you probably need a tank."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,49,"Generally, they will reuse the same cooling solution."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,49,Hopefully they improve on it though.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,50,What annoys me the most is these laptop manufacturer that charges you 3 to 4
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,50,+
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,50,K boasting how slim the laptops are.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,50,Now what they don't tell you is that you get 50 to 60% of the performance that you should be expecting.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,50,"If it is 4K for that, I would recommend you spend 3K on a mini ITX desktop, and remaining 1+K on a thin laptop with a U series processor instead."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,50,At least you still get 2 devices that serves their purpose much better than this.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,51,"Thought the bigger 17 is using some ""fancy"" vapor chamber cooling tech?"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,51,Razer also using it
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,51,i think
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,52,A vapor chamber from my understanding please correct me if I am wrong is almost like a big and flat version of a heatpipe.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,52,"Looking into an Xbox One X, I can see a big copper plate at the base of the chunky cooler, which I believe is a vapor chamber."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,52,"Now for low power devices like phones, the vapor chamber can sort of spread the heat over a wide surface area to keep the SOC cool."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,52,"In a hot device like a laptop or Xbox, you cannot run away from the fact it needs to transfer the heat to a heatsink so that the fan can blow the heat out of the case."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,52,"With little space for the heatsink, the vapor chamber cannot create miracles."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,52,"For something like the Intel processor itself, I suspect the vapor chamber can only delay the thermal throttle by a little longer than without it."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,52,"I believe even the XPS13 utilizes some fancy vapor chamber as well, but you can read the reviews/ comments on the thermals."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,53,"but OEMs are not coming out good screen with AMD Renoir, that the problem."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,54,There is.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,54,Just whether you wanna find or not.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,54,Asus Zephyrus G14 with Pantone certified.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,54,And the G15 is you need the rtx2060 and 240hz panel iirc
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,55,Don't worry probably some diehard Intel supporting lurking around.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,55,"I owned the Intel i H series from Dell, in particular the Dell G3/G5."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,55,"The heat is unbearable during use, not to mention for G5 with RTX2060"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,55,top and bottom is really warm.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,55,Using notebook cooler doesn't help to to cool the laptop that much.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,55,Thus I sold away as I don't want to be cooking my own lap.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,56,ya man the new XPS 13
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,56,they say until got tiger got dragon end up its the hottest laptop I ever used...
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,57,Si meh?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,57,Why you always put the XPS 13 on your laps to work or play games?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,57,Play games of course temperature will shoot up mah
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,57,But the below review said otherwise
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,57,Quote
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,57,"What is super impressive, however, is that there is virtually no heat that transfers up to the keyboard or trackpad."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,57,"Now, while the bottom of the trackpad does warm up quite a bit when it's working hard, the keyboard feels just as cool after 8 hours as it does when we first open the laptop up at the beginning of the day."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,57,Unquote
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,58,I think this review gives you a better perspective of the cooling solution and the thermals of the XPS 13.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,58,"You can see the cooling solution on page 1, and thermal results on page 3."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,58,"The CPU is basically hitting 90 to 100 degs in performance mode, and throttled to 3 Ghz and below."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,58,"Not to mention most of these reviews are performed with a very low ambient temp, i.e. air conditioned room or in cold environment."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,59,Notebook coolers may be effective if there are more vents below.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,59,"So says this review,"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,59,But most laptops provide limited vents below.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,59,"Of course the downside of having more vents is that water might get in if you spill it on the table, not to mention it will get more dusty."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,59,The vents will also likely get blocked if someone uses it on the lap or bed.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,60,lol as usual singapore prices are a total joke.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,60,how can the xps15 BASE model start at above 3000 sgd?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,60,"come on,they really just want people to buy directly from usa."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,61,That's why I was asking him whether he's always playing games on his laps.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,61,"If gaming, and given such a small form factor as the XPS 13, then the temperature will definitely shoot up as expected."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,62,I've had an XPS 13 2-in-1  for about 6 months.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,62,"Since I needed 32 GB of ram, they only offered the 4K option."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,62,"Battery life is quite rubbish maybe 5-6 hours tops at normal usage, and it gets quite hot."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,62,But I love the weight and the fact that it supports active stylus.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,63,Because US base model is an i5/8gb/256/iGPU.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,63,While ours starts at i7/16/512/1650ti
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,64,"Gaming wise, I am pretty sure people won't leave the laptop on their laps."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,64,"Not just because it gets hot, but you need a mouse in most cases."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,64,"For productive work, it is possible it will be used on a lap."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,64,"So if say someone is doing some video encoding, it is a possible scenario."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,64,"In any case, because of the slim form factor, it will not be able to keep the device cool."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,64,"Based on my observation meddling with my E485 back then, the twin slim heatpipe became quite hot within a second even with light load."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,64,"Under sustained load, the heatpipes get really hot and because the heatpipes are so close to the base, it is not ideal to leave the laptop on the lap."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,64,"So nowadays, we can't call it a laptop anymore."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,65,Let's hope dell does a decent job..
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,65,if not its really gonna be a white elephant.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,66,the specs are different no ah?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,66,but max spec this is already nearly 4k...
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,66,can't imagine 17 inch one
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,66,gonna be what price..
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,67,For 4K screen the battery life is always tough on the battery regardless of the laptop size.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,67,I believe in this case you chose 32GB RAM over battery life with 4K
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,68,4.5 to 5 K easily.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,68,I'll wait for Tiger Lake and see
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,69,"I think there should only be Tiger Lake U coming in the later part of this year, which is capped at 4 cores improved CPU architecture and with Xe graphics on 10nm."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,69,"Desktop version of Tiger Lake still runs on 14nm, which means there is a possibility that the 35W/45W chips may also be on 14nm."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,70,Tiger Lake-H with 8C/16T would be nice just like the newly released Comet Lake-H in the DELL 15 & 17 2020 laptops
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,71,I have a feeling the H series will be based on 14nm.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,71,"At this point, 10nm is clearly not ready for high power processors,"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,71,i.e. anything more than 28W.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,71,The reason why I said this is based on observations.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,71,"If 10nm is doing well, I don't see why they will backport Rocket Lake for desktop to 14nm."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,71,"Also for the near future product stack, 10nm is always used only for the U series chips."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,71,"Alder Lake will use 10nm, but rumored to have 8 big cores and 8 small cores, which is a regression from the current 10 big cores."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,71,"I am expecting good IPC gains from this new chip, but I suspect they lose too much clockspeed if they choose 10nm over 14nm, and therefore, regression in performance."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,71,"If that is the case, then this Tiger Lake H is going to run hot as well due to a highly clocked 14nm chip."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,72,not sure what you guys are on about.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,72,: try doing the same config.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,72,its at least 200 $ more expensive in SG.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,73,"By the way while typing this, I just figured out how confusing the naming conventions are."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,73,I feel there are too many Lakes around in the near future.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,73,Please forgive me
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,73,is I get the name wrong.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,74,i'm pretty sure its due to the volume
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,74,Maybe wait for discount
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,75,Just ask the CSO for discount... Usually can get 200 or 300 off
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,76,"eh nowadays XPS not for gaming one, its business line model"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,76,The ORIGINAL XPS if anyone remembers.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,76,"4kg machine with 15"" screen, usd4k price tag 15 yrs ago!"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,76,"If you want to game with dell, go alienware series."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,76,"G series and inspiron lines have mid-range GFX, but don't expect good cooling."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,76,"TS, have you considered external GPU?"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,76,You could have your cake and eat it!
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,76,"Easy upgrade, no overheating, and still keep the ultraportable LG."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,77,If buy eGPU then must buy large 32 inch 4K monitor to play games more shiok mah
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,77,Like I mentioned.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,77,"Likely to go for Tiger Lake-H instead with TB4, PCIe 4.0 and USB"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,77,4
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,77,ah.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,77,LPDDR5 RAM will be unlikely because AMD not using it yet
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,78,Very good piece of weapon to prevent killers and virus.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,79,Does Dell XPS range if laptops have international warranty?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,79,"Every now and then , eBay USA has some high spec laptops listed so could be chance to pick up a new XPS 15 cheaply."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,80,the newest 9300 already have refurbished at very attractive prices on the dell US store.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,80,how to order from there?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,81,wont the refurbished have worse battery life?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,82,Dell warranty should be international.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,82,I picked up a laptop from them in Singapore.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,82,Went to Africa and it broke and the warranty still cover it.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,83,Not for XPS.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,83,"I transferred my US warranty to sg, and they only changed my faulty screen once out of good will."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,84,Their terms keep changing.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,84,"But afaik, only the those with Onsite warranty support are eligible eligible for transfer, not guaranteed covered."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,84,Those on 3yrs ProSupport should automatically be covered already.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,84,Also keep an eye on SG refurbished outlet.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,84,Sometimes can have cancelled/returned stock.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,84,XPS is an ultra premium consumer laptop that is also marketed to business.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,84,"But for business, I'd rather support Latitudes than XPS."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,84,The BIOS and boot firmware in the XPS is trash.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,85,they flip flop like prata
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,86,Dell warranty has been flip flopping around.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,86,Quite bad especially for international customers whom travels a lot.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,86,Dont just say their laptop warranty lah.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,86,Their monitor warranty keep changing from 3 years to 5 years to 3 years.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,86,Then their budget monitor only 1 year.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,87,It was better when Michael Dell re-privatised the company.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,87,Now going downhill again after becoming public yet again.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,88,rooks good.. thanks for sharing
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,89,"The new XPS 17 is now available on Dell online store, but only offered in 2 very basic configurations without the option to spec higher"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,90,just took delivery of the XPS 15 base model FHD
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,91,Yeah.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,91,The RTX version will cost a leg and arm though
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,92,How is it?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,92,Any issues with the trackpad?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,93,The new Dell laptops come with Killer WiFi which is lousy
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,93,Wait for Dell to adopt the Qualcomm WiFi
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,93,then consider
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,93,🙄
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,94,Huh?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,94,Qualcomm is Killer wifi just a gaming name in it.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,94,Are you referring to Intel?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,95,Intel bought over Rivet Networks Killer lah
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,95,Qualcomm is Qualcomm
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,96,Got to wait for review on the thermal.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,96,"With RTX, xps gonna run hot."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,96,Xps 15 is already known for bad thermals.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,96,"Can wait and see how xps 17, with the new thermal vapour chamber can perform."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,96,Power doesn't mean much.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,96,You can get i9 w xps 15
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,96,but it will throttle so much it doesn't make sense to get it.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,97,I got the 9560 model and I never had any issues with wifi connectivity even w killer wifi cards.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,98,Amazing coming from Asus UX533.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,98,"Wifey using it, so CPU performance itself is a welcome from Quad to 6 cores i7"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,98,FHD screen is bright and contrasty.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,98,Wonder how the 4K will look like in real life.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,98,Compared to UX533
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,98,this trackpad is amazing.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,98,What issues do you face?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,98,So far not issues.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,98,"Of course compared to my MBP15 windows trackpad gestures still a long way to go, but I am good with the XPS."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,98,Bought Dbrands skins to protect the shiny case.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,98,"Looted with 4 years accidental damage warranty, hope this last good until 2024"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,99,is there any shop selling xps17 with installments ?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,99,USA shop lets you do it but
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,99,apparently not the SG shop
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,100,Perhaps you should get a credit card.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,100,I recently bought XPS 13 and used 0% instalment via POSB EVERYDAY card.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,101,Can get the DELL XPS 17 9700 2020 and pay for installments here.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,102,thanks
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,102,"yea so apparently i would need a credit card for this...

any suggestions ?"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,103,"Sorry, the $3999 model comes with 4K touchscreen."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,103,10th
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,103,"Generation Intel® Core™ i7-10875H 16MB Cache, up to 5.1 GHz,
8 cores"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,103,The Core i9 with the RTX2060 will costs you more than $4500
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,104,is there a list of eligible credit cards or any credit card is eligible for instalments?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,104,i think youre quoting the wrong post.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,105,The ad mentioned only on Selected Cc
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,105,*
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,105,*
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,105,*
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,105,I recommend you just use those cards like Ocbc cashflo CC or Everyday POSB
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,105,"get 0% interest, process fee, straight instalment kind"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,105,no bs
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,106,"thanks im still considering because if i buy from Dell USA for Work website it costs like 400-600 Sgd less, higher config."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,107,Any suggestion on how to ship from US to SG without costing an arm or a leg?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,107,Also thinking of buying from Dell USA for the RTX config.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,108,Hmm I read on Reddit and YouTube a lot of people their touchpad is not aligned or is loose.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,108,So like you can press down but the click is not registered unless you press hard
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,109,Dont bother.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,109,With shipping costs it will be more expensive.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,109,Cant even afford the current price.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,109,Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,110,"use vpost, just dont declare its actual price and YOLO."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,111,The battery life of the 17 inch 4K running at 1080p is about 6hr only.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,111,If used at 4K battery sure about 4 hrs plus
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,112,"yea personally i dont know what to do with the 4k display, it's even glossy."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,112,much better then FHD that is also matte.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,113,Can watch 4K movies lor.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,113,It comes with anti-reflective screen so should not be too bad.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,113,Get the one with 8 cores and can run VM smoother by allocating more cores to the VM.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,113,You can even run Windows Sandbox in VM if you allocate 4 cores to it.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,113,😁
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,114,Wonder if anyone kena caught before
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,115,If kena caught sure on front page of newspapers and pay until your pants drop
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,115,😁
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,116,tbh we just need a forum member whos coming back to sg from the USA
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,116,and we're good.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,117,"4k for 17"" makes sense."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,117,At least more sense than 13 or 15 inch.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,117,I wonder how much more battery life you can get if you undervolt the cpu.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,118,Ordered a XPS 15 9500 with the UHD+ 3840 x 2400 InfinityEdge Touch Anti-Reflective display option.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,118,Thanks for the tip on Dbrand - just ordered the skin set.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,118,Hope that it's easy to apply.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,119,"Besides ordering from Dell SG online, are there other good venues that can offer good price for Dell laptops?"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,120,"When ordering from Dell online, order through the CSO."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,120,I managed to secure a better deal.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,121,whats the CSO ?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,122,Customer service officer.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,122,Chat with them during office hours.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,123,Can get another 10% off?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,124,what should i ask for ?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,124,and how much would they shave off?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,125,"Ask the CSO whether there are any deals available for the XPS15, and provide details of the exact specs that you are interested in."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,126,Yea try ask ask for freebies
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,127,Buyer beware.

XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell,XPS,127,"However, note that it can only act as a 65W power source when used as a battery and a 90W power source in ""passthrough mode"" when the power bank itself is plugged into a power source."

Chromebook,,,143,"Hi all,
Im looking for a portable minimalistic device for web surfing, Google drive and web messengers telegram whatsapp."
Chromebook,,,143,"Heard about chromebooks, did some research an"
Chromebook,,,143,it's the kind of device I'm looking for.
Chromebook,,,143,However it seems like it's not available in Singapore.
Chromebook,,,143,Where should I be looking at to get one for myself or to at least to get a hands on feel.
Chromebook,,,143,Models I'm looking at :
Chromebook,,,143,Dell chromebook 13 and Acer chromebook 14.
Chromebook,,,144,I am waiting for Samsung Chromebook Pro...
Chromebook,,,145,"Hi All,"
Chromebook,,,145,Just wondering how many of you are have hear of them or are currently using them?
Chromebook,,,145,Personally I'm using one and feel that they're a great niche laptop that can help students or seniors to get familiar with the internet.
Chromebook,,,145,Currently the government has plans to use Chromebook for their plans.
Chromebook,,,145,"Link
."
Chromebook,,,145,Also Android Play Store is slowing coming into existing and new Chromebook
Chromebook,,,145,so the future is bright.
Chromebook,,,145,So what do you guys think?
Chromebook,,,145,Note: If anyone have any questions on Chromebooks please feel free to ask them here
Chromebook,,,145,", I hope that this thread can be like one of the [official] thread."
Chromebook,,,145,Thanks.
Chromebook,,,146,"I am waiting to try on one, Samsung Chromebook Pro."
Chromebook,,,147,May be can list some advantages for newbies like me?
Chromebook,,,148,@Wyvern8
Chromebook,,,148,"Initial reviews are out, have you check them yet?"
Chromebook,,,148,Looks promising.
Chromebook,,,148,Hopefully Samsung will bring them here to SG
Chromebook,,,148,Praying very hard.
Chromebook,,,148,@Bull
Chromebook,,,148,Runnings
Chromebook,,,148,"Sure things, I'll list them down below Source:"
Chromebook,,,148,Pros:
Chromebook,,,148,Price: The majority of Chromebooks cost significantly less than your average laptop.
Chromebook,,,148,Chromebooks can be had for as little as $200 with mid-range models in the $300-400 range.
Chromebook,,,148,Speed: Chromebooks can power on and be ready to use in around eight seconds.
Chromebook,,,148,They can do this because of their SSD hard drives and the lightweight Chrome OS.
Chromebook,,,148,Battery: Expect to get six hours or more from the battery on an average Chromebook.
Chromebook,,,148,Some even claim as much as 13 hours.
Chromebook,,,148,This is often more than you might get on a standard Windows laptops.
Chromebook,,,148,Sync
Chromebook,,,148,: Chromebooks sync all your apps and passwords with Chrome browsers on other computers.
Chromebook,,,148,"So, if you use the Chrome browser at work, or on another home computer, your bookmarks and other preferences will automatically sync to your Chromebook."
Chromebook,,,148,Cloud Storage
Chromebook,,,148,: You get 100GB of Google Drive storage free for two years with all new Chromebooks.
Chromebook,,,148,This is a huge amount of space.
Chromebook,,,148,"Comparable service from Dropbox, OneDrive or Box would cost significant money."
Chromebook,,,148,Updates:
Chromebook,,,148,"Chromebooks update themselves silently, automatically, and in the background."
Chromebook,,,148,"So, your device is always up to date and works just the way you need it to which in turn helps with the security."
Chromebook,,,148,Weight
Chromebook,,,148,": This varies, but most Chromebooks are lightweight devices that are portable and easy to carry with you when you need them."
Chromebook,,,148,Android Apps: Google have announced that you will soon be able to run Android apps on your Chromebook.
Chromebook,,,148,This merging of Chrome OS and Android enhances the functionality of a Chromebook.
Chromebook,,,148,"It means you can use Android apps by Adobe, Microsoft and others to play games, create and edit files, or play music and movies."
Chromebook,,,148,Cons:
Chromebook,,,148,"Office: If you are married to Microsoft Office products, a Chromebook is not for you."
Chromebook,,,148,Google encourages you to use its own free online suite of Office-like services.
Chromebook,,,148,"Many of these services are comparable to components of Microsoft Office, but they do lack features that you may have come to rely on."
Chromebook,,,148,"Although you can use the Android version of Office apps, they lack some of the full functionality in their desktop equivalents."
Chromebook,,,148,Storage:
Chromebook,,,148,Chromebooks typically only have 32GB of on-board storage.
Chromebook,,,148,Limiting storage helps keep the price down because component costs are cheaper.
Chromebook,,,148,"Google wants you to store your data in the cloud, and that is why it often includes 100GB of online storage for free with new Chrombooks."
Chromebook,,,148,"Printing: You can print on a Chromebook without too much difficulty, but depending on the printer you have, it might not be as easy as it used to be, because you are required to use Google Cloud Print."
Chromebook,,,148,Compatibility
Chromebook,,,148,: There is no doubt about it.
Chromebook,,,148,Windows is the most widely used desktop operating system in existence today.
Chromebook,,,148,"As such, you will find no shortage of apps and accessories to use with a Windows PC."
Chromebook,,,148,A Chromebook can be more limited in this regard.
Chromebook,,,148,"It has a growing library of software applications, and can be used with a wide variety of accessories, but Windows machines still win in the battle for compatibility."
Chromebook,,,148,Hope this helps.
Chromebook,,,148,Thanks.
Chromebook,,,149,Will check through
Chromebook,,,149,If you would like I can help you rename the thread to the [Official] Chromebook Thread or any naming that you would like
Chromebook,,,150,@Intrinion That'll be great.
Chromebook,,,150,Thanks alot.
Chromebook,,,150,How about this Thread name: [Official] Chromebook SG
Chromebook,,,151,You are most welcome
Chromebook,,,151,Looks good on my end.
Chromebook,,,151,Let me know if you see the changes on your side.
Chromebook,,,151,"On a side note, coincidentally, I was looking at the reviews of the Samsung Chromebook Pro over the weekends."
Chromebook,,,151,It's currently in beta phase & will be released probably Apr.
Chromebook,,,151,Looks promising with the included S-pen!
Chromebook,,,151,However some reviewers said that Android apps were unusable / stuttery at best.
Chromebook,,,151,What are your opinions on it?
Chromebook,,,152,Oh... Samsung Chromebook Plus is available already.
Chromebook,,,152,But I would hold for Samsung Chromebook Pro...
Chromebook,,,153,"Btw, where to get the chromebooks..?"
Chromebook,,,153,I mean I don't see them on retail..
Chromebook,,,154,Generally not sold in Singapore.
Chromebook,,,154,Courts used to sell them :O
Chromebook,,,154,Would have to be purchased online via Amazon / Ebay etc.
Chromebook,,,155,@Intrinion
Chromebook,,,155,"Yup, as mention it's in beta hence not ready for the general usage."
Chromebook,,,155,From what i gathered
Chromebook,,,155,it's the most likely due to different cpu that is used.
Chromebook,,,155,"In general, most Chromebook is using x86/intel CPU chipset and most android is using ARM chipset."
Chromebook,,,155,This led to the Android apps being optimised heavily on ARM processing.
Chromebook,,,155,Past Android devices running on Intel chipset has not received much positive feedback and led to manufacturer dropping the support for the chipset.
Chromebook,,,155,However if the merging of Chromebook and Android Play store
Chromebook,,,155,I believe Google will step up the development of it.
Chromebook,,,155,"There's few comments on the reddit thread that general usage of Android Apps is quite okay, what's is needed is to not set a high standard of expectation of it I.e. Running as smooth as an Android phone for now Especially games."
Chromebook,,,155,@Wyvern8
Chromebook,,,155,Sadly it's the same everywhere except US.
Chromebook,,,155,Due to the low demand for the device everywhere
Chromebook,,,155,it's quite hard to find them locally.
Chromebook,,,155,I did see ASUS selling their Chromebox/Chromebit Forget which one here in last year
Chromebook,,,155,but it's not what I wanted
Chromebook,,,155,and the specs is quite low lowest end model which result in less sales and then less incentive for companies to bring them in A vicious cycle.
Chromebook,,,155,With the government tender
Chromebook,,,155,i hope it might pick up interest and pace.
Chromebook,,,155,Also another thing is that the Chromebook here are overpriced.
Chromebook,,,155,The specs they've and the prices they've just don't match.
Chromebook,,,155,I can get better deals on Amazon and with shipping
Chromebook,,,155,it's sometime still better.
Chromebook,,,156,Cuz of the profit margin that is why retailers don't carry Chromebooks.
Chromebook,,,156,"However Education sector, some schools are using Chromebooks."
Chromebook,,,156,for lessons already.
Chromebook,,,156,"It has been a while already, if you guys really want comments about"
Chromebook,,,156,Chromebooks can ask me also.
Chromebook,,,156,My past project was purchase of two carts of Chromebook.
Chromebook,,,156,since they are cost effective.
Chromebook,,,156,for students to do homework and do learning.
Chromebook,,,156,However not all environment permit full access to Playstore.
Chromebook,,,156,featuers and items thus it is one major challenge.
Chromebook,,,156,The purchase was the Intel reference based chromebook.
Chromebook,,,156,Cost wise
Chromebook,,,156,"I cannot disclosed cuz consumer, education and."
Chromebook,,,156,commercial pricing varies.
Chromebook,,,156,"Yes there are local distributor for Chromebooks, however I am not sure"
Chromebook,,,156,do they sell to consumer or not.
Chromebook,,,156,You can Google for them and send a email to them
Chromebook,,,156,but they mainly sell to schools only.
Chromebook,,,156,Hope this hopes.
Chromebook,,,157,i had a budget samsung chromebook the one using the arm chip way back
Chromebook,,,157,and i think it's great for what it is a machine with just a browser..
Chromebook,,,157,the latest 2017 chromebooks look great though....especially with direct Play Store integration.
Chromebook,,,157,like many stated here...
Chromebook,,,157,The Samsung Chromebook Pro and the Asus Chromebook Flip
Chromebook,,,157,C302a are both i am currently scouting...
Chromebook,,,157,it's too bad that there are still no official news on these items being available officially in singapore with official warranty.
Chromebook,,,157,"the old samsung chromebook, i had to import from Amazon US"
Chromebook,,,158,MS Office are now available via Android apps.
Chromebook,,,158,"Also, the online office apps via MS Onedrive is also sufficient enough."
Chromebook,,,158,"Unless you are truly power excel users that requires spreadsheets with tens of thousands of cells or weird plugins, i reckon most ppl can just work with these version of Office or even Google Drive Sheets."
Chromebook,,,159,it make alot of sense for education sectors to use chromebook...
Chromebook,,,159,first they don't have to worry about security as chromebooks are locked down OS with just browser.
Chromebook,,,159,Even the Android Apps are sandboxed and easy to manage...
Chromebook,,,159,so the IT maintenance cost is minimise.
Chromebook,,,159,then there's the cost of licensing....
Chromebook,,,159,"for windows PC, the cost to license the OS, the different software antivirus, office, etc cost quite abit..."
Chromebook,,,159,those cost are pretty much gone if using chromebook.
Chromebook,,,159,"finally, chromebook are 'disposable' and cloud based..."
Chromebook,,,159,"i.e....if the chromebook hardware is faulty and need a replacement, IT can just issue the user a new one and the user just need to login to his/her id and that's it..."
Chromebook,,,159,"no need to do those re-imaging of OS, reconfiguration, domain security type of bullsh!t normally needed to deal with traditionally windows machines in corporate domain."
Chromebook,,,159,This is the reason why MS decided to release their own 'cloud-based' Windows 10.
Chromebook,,,159,to combat Chromebooks and Chrome OS as the Education sectors in US and other smaller Asia countries has been adopting chromebooks at a faster rate that really eat into Microsoft's licensing margin.
Chromebook,,,160,https://www3.lenovo.com/sg/en/laptop...0GECTO1WWENSG0唔平！
Chromebook,,,161,Not sure about MS
Chromebook,,,161,but even if they have they always demand high price especially their license.
Chromebook,,,161,"Google wise their platform are pretty much cost effective, about the asset management."
Chromebook,,,161,"Primarily if you need to have a main Google account than you can manage all the asset, deploy software, manage users and etc."
Chromebook,,,161,using the Google admin tool.
Chromebook,,,161,Unlike most asset management/deployment tool which need to be paid Google
Chromebook,,,161,one is free but that is provided you have the cloud services or G suit in order to tap on such software.
Chromebook,,,162,"i would love to have the Chromebook Plus, with S Pen, and with LTE."
Chromebook,,,162,totally no meaning
Chromebook,,,162,if no LTE.
Chromebook,,,163,it's good enough for my mother to surf net and watching youtube.
Chromebook,,,163,"productivity aspect damn cui, primarily lacking the MS word prog"
Chromebook,,,164,"Chrome OS is basically a gimped version of Gentoo with Coreboot instead of UEFI, soldered down components and a special build of the Chrome browser."
Chromebook,,,164,I get more productivity and the same kind of security out of my existing notebook running Fedora than Chrome OS.
Chromebook,,,165,the general users have no interest in running sudo or apt-get just to install stuff or keep the system up to date.
Chromebook,,,166,"As someone has pointed out above, the lenovo thinkpad 11e chromebook is for sale in SG!"
Chromebook,,,166,I am currently using one as a secondary laptop
Chromebook,,,166,and it's pretty usable for education or even as an entertainment device.
Chromebook,,,166,It replaced my lenovo 100s windows 2gb ram which was laggy and has a bad tn panel.
Chromebook,,,166,This has a IPS screen and great keyboard!
Chromebook,,,166,"I agree with the pros and cons that was pointed out, especially the part where you can't use microsoft office."
Chromebook,,,166,It wasn't a deal breaker for me as I adapted quite quickly to the google's own suite of apps.
Chromebook,,,166,Personally I feel chrome OS will definitely be better once the play market is out for all chromebook.
Chromebook,,,166,Thinking of replacing my surface pro 3 with the samsung chromebook as I take loads of handwritten notes.
Chromebook,,,166,<3 chromebooks
Chromebook,,,167,"@techidiot Thank you for the information, i did a quick google and those company  does not seems to be bringing the latest Chromebook"
Chromebook,,,167,maybe due to cost or demand.
Chromebook,,,167,I highly doubt that Chromebook for consumer in SG will be seeing their lights anytime soon meaning getting from Amazon is still the most direct way.
Chromebook,,,167,@lordlad0
Chromebook,,,167,"Same here, my Chromebooks ASUS & Dell had to be imported from Amazon because there's just no place selling them in SG."
Chromebook,,,167,2017 looks to be the year of Chromebook.
Chromebook,,,167,Finger cross.
Chromebook,,,167,There's Office 365
Chromebook,,,167,if one needs the full power of MS suite.
Chromebook,,,167,"Initial preview of MS Windows ""Cloud"" looks to be something similar to their previously shelf-ed Windows RT with upgraded features."
Chromebook,,,167,I also hear that they aren't allowed to run any exe programs
Chromebook,,,167,so if that's true then it's going to be a failure again just like RT.
Chromebook,,,167,They're banging heavily on their UWP Universal Windows Platform to compete with Chromebook.
Chromebook,,,167,@Ed.
Chromebook,,,167,"YEO Thank you for the link, I did came across that awhile ago but forgot about it."
Chromebook,,,167,"The specs for this is not appealing to me at all, with that price I probably could get a better spec Chromebook from Amazon."
Chromebook,,,167,@G4 Agree with you that without any internet connection Chromebook would be quite useless outside of Wifi areas.
Chromebook,,,167,"Hence comes need for Mifi, I personally use one of those and it's convenient to bring around"
Chromebook,,,167,I bought extra SIM card from my mobile.
Chromebook,,,167,I recommend this
Chromebook,,,167,", it has a huge battery enough to charge a phone"
Chromebook,,,167,and it's not pricey as Huawei.
Chromebook,,,167,"Link:
@lunarsong"
Chromebook,,,167,You can use Google Suite for productivity but YMMY.
Chromebook,,,167,Else there's Office 365 if you want to pay for something better.
Chromebook,,,167,TBH
Chromebook,,,167,I find Google Suite
Chromebook,,,167,just good enough for me to ditch Office all together.
Chromebook,,,167,@Rock-kun True that it's not as productive as other Linux distro
Chromebook,,,167,but you can actually dual boot your Chromebook with Ubuntu.
Chromebook,,,167,It's called Crouton and it's quite interesting
Chromebook,,,167,but I have no interest as of now to do it.
Chromebook,,,167,Link:
Chromebook,,,167,ChromeOS alone is enough for me now.
Chromebook,,,167,@soupgoblin
Chromebook,,,167,Great to hear your experiences with Chromebook.
Chromebook,,,167,I actually use Chromebook more often than my rig.
Chromebook,,,167,Usually once I reached home
Chromebook,,,167,I'm too tired to play
Chromebook,,,167,games Old man
Chromebook,,,167,liao
Chromebook,,,167,so I just watch youtube.
Chromebook,,,167,Personally I fear the build quality of ASUS as I have a ASUS C200MA
Chromebook,,,167,that broke down
Chromebook,,,167,only 6 months after I purchase it Battery died on me.
Chromebook,,,167,There's a reddit thread on ASUS build quality awhile ago if many people sharing their bad experiences with their Chromebook.
Chromebook,,,167,It shook my confidences with them.
Chromebook,,,167,Good thing is that local service centre can do a repair for me at a unreasonable cost.
Chromebook,,,167,"I find that I have less reasons to buy any ""cheap"" laptop now with Chromebooks around."
Chromebook,,,168,I have been using the Toshiba Chromebook 2 since late 2014 and just recently switched to the HP Chromebook 13.
Chromebook,,,168,ChromeOS is really fantastic for everyday use.
Chromebook,,,168,Really using it everyday.
Chromebook,,,168,I only turn on my windows PC once per month.
Chromebook,,,169,"Wow.. just curious, where do you purchase your Chromebook...?"
Chromebook,,,169,Tks...
Chromebook,,,170,the first one was from amazon and with free shipping
Chromebook,,,170,the second one using comgateway concierge service had to pay 5% service and sucky exchange rates all because hp.com usa won't accept overseas credit card
Chromebook,,,171,read on the [official] chromebook thread that lenovo chromebooks are available locally.
Chromebook,,,171,"Never seen them myself, I got"
Chromebook,,,171,mine online - amazon and hp.com through comgateway
Chromebook,,,172,"You can use Amazon Global to ship Chromebook directly, just that the selection might be a little."
Chromebook,,,172,"Link:
FYI, Both ASUS C302 and Samsung Chromebook plus is on Amazon Global now."
Chromebook,,,173,I bought Toshiba Chromebook 2014 in 2015 to use for university.
Chromebook,,,173,Back then it was the only sub sgd $300 laptop with 1080p screen.
Chromebook,,,173,"When I used it in school, everyone will comment"
Chromebook,,,173,1
Chromebook,,,173,What notebook is it?
Chromebook,,,173,2
Chromebook,,,173,Google HAS AN OPERATING SYSTEM?
Chromebook,,,173,SO COOL!
Chromebook,,,173,3
Chromebook,,,173,The screen looks nice!
Chromebook,,,173,4
Chromebook,,,173,You don't need charger meh?
Chromebook,,,173,...
Chromebook,,,173,More prestigious owning a Mac!
Chromebook,,,173,What I liked about it is 10h battery life
Chromebook,,,173,Back then most people crouton + Wine
Chromebook,,,173,to run windows program alongside chromeOS.
Chromebook,,,173,"If your chromebook is more powerful model, can also play games!"
Chromebook,,,173,For me only text based games or guild wars 1.
Chromebook,,,173,adjusting crouton to look like Mac
Chromebook,,,173,In 2016 gallium OS was released!
Chromebook,,,173,It is more stable than crouton and makes running windows 7 easy.
Chromebook,,,173,I'm no longer updated about chromebooks.
Chromebook,,,173,Some models support native windows 10.
Chromebook,,,173,"Eg acer 14/15 toshiba chromebook 2015, acer 720 etc"
Chromebook,,,173,Just check here and see if Full Rom is available.
Chromebook,,,173,"If you are new and just want to use office, the microsoft office online works well."
Chromebook,,,173,"You can edit office documents by uploading to your dropbox, and selecting edit from chrome browser dropbox page."
Chromebook,,,173,"Now the toshiba still working, I just use it to watch videos because of the nice 13 inch 1080p IPS LG screen."
Chromebook,,,173,1080p video playback not a problem!
Chromebook,,,173,It was an issue back then before hardware decoder existed
Chromebook,,,174,"If you're buying a Chromebook to run Crouton + Wine, might as well just go for a generic notebook and slap a full-fledged Linux distribution on it."
Chromebook,,,174,And Nepgear <3
Chromebook,,,175,can you get a 1080p laptop for under $300?
Chromebook,,,175,back then you cant.
Chromebook,,,175,even if you can now it wont have ips screen
Chromebook,,,176,Does the Thinkpad 11e support any stylus inputs?
Chromebook,,,177,@yusoffb01
Chromebook,,,177,"You're right, but you might have a hit on Carousell if you search and bargain."
Chromebook,,,177,@Intrinion
Chromebook,,,177,"According to this Lenovo site Link:
, There's a stylus for it."
Chromebook,,,178,@intrinion
Chromebook,,,178,@generalwu
Chromebook,,,178,Mine came without the stylus but
Chromebook,,,178,As what generalwu pointed out
Chromebook,,,178,"and I just found out there seem to be a stylus available for it, not sure if its good enough to jot notes on though."
Chromebook,,,178,The touch screen is quite accurate!
Chromebook,,,178,"Also to all owners, do check if your chromebook have the newest developer channel available"
Chromebook,,,178,", I just updated mine to that"
Chromebook,,,178,and playstore is available!
Chromebook,,,178,Downloaded a few apps and made my chromebook even more useful
Chromebook,,,179,@soupgoblin
Chromebook,,,179,"Nah, mine didn't make it into the list of Play Store support."
Chromebook,,,179,I'm using Dell Chromebook 11 2014 Version.
Chromebook,,,179,Hence I'm looking into purchasing a new one.
Chromebook,,,179,Tempted to get C302 or Samsung Chromebook plus but the cost puts me down.
Chromebook,,,179,Now but next best option would be Acer C740
Chromebook,,,179,which has Play Store supported.
Chromebook,,,180,I have a habit where I keep more than 20 tabs open in chrome browser.
Chromebook,,,180,Would Chromebook be able to handle that?
Chromebook,,,180,I used to have an old i5 2nd gen laptop with 4gb ram
Chromebook,,,180,I think which would slow down quite a bit when I do that.
Chromebook,,,181,You need to change your habit first
Chromebook,,,182,so watching 1080P movies not an issue ?
Chromebook,,,182,need special software ?

Chromebook,,,183,You can try this chrome extension Link:
Chromebook,,,183,@Swordsman Are you referring to gallium OS or ChromeOS?
Chromebook,,,183,With gallium OS you can download pretty much any player that supports Linux.
Chromebook,,,183,"With ChromeOS you can try VLC App, but not so stable the last time I use."
Chromebook,,,183,Also the codec used in the video is important too.
Chromebook,,,183,If using hard to decode stuff then the average Chromebook will slutter.
Chromebook,,,183,Hence I always opt for fast processor Chromebook model.
Chromebook,,,184,FYI.
Chromebook,,,184,Currently there's a sales going on at Amazon for Lenovo Chromebook 13

Chromebook,,,191,"With FSSG, the ASUS C300SA is @"
Chromebook,,,191,~ 250sgd.
Chromebook,,,192,That has a really shitty screen.
Chromebook,,,192,wouldn't pay more than $200 for that.
Chromebook,,,192,It has 20% bad reviews because it doesnt last 1 year.
Chromebook,,,192,and Asus laptop isn't a premium brand.
Chromebook,,,192,They break down easily compared to other brands.
Chromebook,,,192,You should have paid more and buy Acer 15!
Chromebook,,,193,"@cannotliao Lol, 5 Chromebook?"
Chromebook,,,193,You're the boss
Chromebook,,,193,liao.
Chromebook,,,193,I only got 2 nia.
Chromebook,,,193,My first one already from Amazon without international shipping.
Chromebook,,,193,Didn't know back

Chromebook,,,193,Aww...
Chromebook,,,193,That's not a really a good deal but nonetheless just enjoy it.
Chromebook,,,193,@yusoffb01 I agree that most common ASUS Chromebook has a bad rep with builds.
Chromebook,,,193,My ASUS Chromebook's battery broke down on me with only months of usage.
Chromebook,,,193,There's a website that lists down all Chromebook and it's available specs.
Chromebook,,,193,Link:
Chromebook,,,193,I think it's very useful in choosing your Chromebook.
Chromebook,,,193,Hope this helps.

Chromebook,,,194,"Thankfully, I managed to cancel the order before it ships."
Chromebook,,,194,"How about this one then
?"
Chromebook,,,195,"@eikooc Check my last post, I have attached a link which have all launched Chromebook and its specs."
Chromebook,,,195,This can help you locate the best Chromebook possible.
Chromebook,,,195,Also do you have a budget for your purchase?
Chromebook,,,195,"If so, what is the max before calculating the shipping cost."
Chromebook,,,195,Any specific requirement do you have for your Chromebook?
Chromebook,,,195,Screen size?
Chromebook,,,195,Hope this helps.
Chromebook,,,196,I think the next gen of chromebooks should be able to run android apps and preferable with touchscreen.
Chromebook,,,196,You may save money getting old models but lose out on performance and functionality
Chromebook,,,196,Android apps are really useful
Chromebook,,,197,Anyone tried using blackboard collaborate on chromebooks?
Chromebook,,,197,Does it work?

Chromebook,,,198,@jeffrey745
Chromebook,,,198,"I've no idea, I do not use the app before."
Chromebook,,,198,"According to this website, it does not at least for the regular ones."

Chromebook,,,199,Does the chromebook come with dual voltage/frequency capability?
Chromebook,,,200,"Hi, Yup you can."
Chromebook,,,200,Both of my Chromebooks are from Amazon and it's been fine since day one.
Chromebook,,,200,To be safe you'll need to check the label on the charger to see if it supports our voltage but to be fair most laptop chargers
Chromebook,,,200,nowadays have support.
Chromebook,,,200,"Refer to this site for a more detail explanation Link:
Cheers"
Chromebook,,,201,Wow thanks!
Chromebook,,,201,The chromebook plus itself able to support 220-240v?
Chromebook,,,201,I got 2 sets of chargers with usb type a to type c cables courtesy of note 7 exchanges.
Chromebook,,,201,Can i use these chargers to charge the chromebook plus?
Chromebook,,,202,"Hi, I do not have the Samsung Chromebook"
Chromebook,,,202,"Plus so I can't say for sure, but for my Chromebooks they do and I would assume they would do for Samsung Chromebook too."
Chromebook,,,202,"Logically speaking, since laptops are made for travelling around the world it would be wise for the manufacturer to made that as an feature required for any product they sell."
Chromebook,,,202,I highly doubt those normal USB charger can power up your laptops.
Chromebook,,,202,You would require something else that can provide more ampere & voltage for the Chromebook.
Chromebook,,,202,I would suggest that you can just bite the bullet.
Chromebook,,,202,Hope this helps.

Chromebook,,,207,I have not tried it yet though.
Chromebook,,,208,"Not true, bought the above Asus laptop except with 2gb of ram at $170 1.5 years ago, battery life and etc still working fine."
Chromebook,,,208,Only gripe will only be the lousy screen quality.
Chromebook,,,209,Guess we all have different experiences with ASUS built quality.
Chromebook,,,210,Dell US Outlet has offer Link:

Chromebook,,,215,experimented with Win10 on my old chromebook.
Chromebook,,,215,I will say dun bother.
Chromebook,,,215,u need windows get a proper windows laptop.
Chromebook,,,215,The only thing stopping us is driver support.
Chromebook,,,215,manufacturers dun bother to release win drivers for CB.
Chromebook,,,215,"there are third party ones written by others, but install them at ur own risk"
Chromebook,,,215,"If really need windows, then use a remote desktop connection to ur own windows PC lor."
Chromebook,,,215,"90% of the time, at home, I dun need windows"
Chromebook,,,216,I have the same CB too.
Chromebook,,,216,still going strong.
Chromebook,,,216,u want better screen
Chromebook,,,216,then u have to throw more $$ to get one with better screen.
Chromebook,,,217,The Samsung Chromebook Plus looks goodplus a price drop of us$30.
Chromebook,,,217,Reviews are mixed.
Chromebook,,,217,Thinking of buying this or Samsung Tab S3 to replace my aging Ipad 2
Chromebook,,,217,Not too sure I am willing to take a risk on the warranty.
Chromebook,,,218,Should try installing a full-fledged Linux distribution then.
Chromebook,,,218,"Since ChromeOS is basically Gentoo at its core, any recent Linux distribution should work with all its hardware out of the box."
Chromebook,,,219,Buy from Amazon and not from vendors on Amazon.
Chromebook,,,219,This will ensure that they'll provide a good service.
Chromebook,,,219,So far I see is normal le
Chromebook,,,219,", I would take a risk if I were on your position."
Chromebook,,,220,Just saw the Straits Times articles on Chromebooks.
Chromebook,,,220,and read that the HP Chromebook 13 are now available locally.

Chromebook,,,221,Nice at least they're selling a decent one with android support.

Chromebook,,,221,Better than nth
Chromebook,,,221,I guess.
Chromebook,,,222,Have been waiting to get Chromebook for quite a while and almost bought the HP Chromebook G1.
Chromebook,,,222,"However, I'd some reservation when I realised that it doesn't have a touch screen."
Chromebook,,,222,What do you guys think of using Android apps with just keyboard alone?
Chromebook,,,223,Some apps don't work well without touchscreen.
Chromebook,,,223,Had to use the cursor keys to navigate the mouse pointer.
Chromebook,,,223,Definitely not optimal.
Chromebook,,,224,Well if you haven't buy it yet then it's best to get one with touch screen as Android is heavily optimized for touch control.
Chromebook,,,225,After owning Toshiba chromebook 2 since 2014 I decided to install windows!
Chromebook,,,225,TC2 only has 16gb emmc
Chromebook,,,225,but it is possible to install.
Chromebook,,,225,Also coolstar has developed drivers for most chromebooks so can install with everything working!
Chromebook,,,225,hdmi.
Chromebook,,,225,"sound, wifi, graphics"
Chromebook,,,225,steps are easy.
Chromebook,,,225,just follow the instructions here.
Chromebook,,,225,"After installing windows 10, only had 2gb free."
Chromebook,,,225,had to delete unnecessary files and use the built in compact.exe in windows 10.
Chromebook,,,225,Quite happy to have more than 50% disk space free.
Chromebook,,,225,Everything working after using drivers from coolstar.
Chromebook,,,225,Ram usage is around 800mb after boot.
Chromebook,,,225,"So for around sgd $370 in 2014, I now have a windows 10 laptop with 1080p screen."
Chromebook,,,225,"If you are interested to install, check the laptop compatibility list here:"
Chromebook,,,225,Panasonic batteries still good after 3 years
Chromebook,,,226,Too much unnecessary effort IMO.
Chromebook,,,226,I will just slap an up-to-date Linux distribution on a Chromebook and not worry about drivers or insufficient storage.
Chromebook,,,227,Needs a bit more knowledge for you
Chromebook,,,228,"Lol, windows in Chromebook."
Chromebook,,,228,Doesn't that defeat the purpose of a Chromebook?
Chromebook,,,228,"Anyway, there's rumor of a Windows 'Chromebook' coming soon this year"
Chromebook,,,228,so we'll see how it goes.
Chromebook,,,229,i don't see the point of a lightweight windows machine for any users other than the education sector...
Chromebook,,,229,the whole point of using windows is to run the win32 applications.
Chromebook,,,229,"If you can't run win32 application and only can run windows store UWP apps, then it is as good as the ARM version of windows which is pointless btw."
Chromebook,,,230,"Not for Windows yes, but Linux users are buying Chromebooks to run Linux on them."
Chromebook,,,230,Which is no surprise actually.
Chromebook,,,230,Chrome OS is basically a modified Gentoo with an out-of-tree kernel.
Chromebook,,,230,"Because of this, there is a very high chance of all of a Chromebook's hardware working properly on any standard Linux distribution."
Chromebook,,,230,"So you get a machine that is almost 100% compatible with Linux, and yet get a full-fledged desktop experience after putting a standard distribution on it without the space constraints."
Chromebook,,,230,A basic install of most distributions can go as low
Chromebook,,,230,"as sub-4GB, and yet still come with just about everything that is needed to start working out of the box drivers, productivity suite, multimedia players, development tools, etc."
Chromebook,,,230,Even Linus Torvalds bought a Chromebook Pixel to install Linux on.
Chromebook,,,231,Is this some kind of a hack?
Chromebook,,,231,Thought all along Chromebook cannot install files one?
Chromebook,,,231,How do u manage to install win10 on it?
Chromebook,,,232,steps are easy.
Chromebook,,,232,just follow the instructions here
Chromebook,,,232,can be done in 1hour.
Chromebook,,,232,10minutes set developer mode on chromebook.

Chromebook,,,238,"Lol, All of us asking same question."

Chromebook,,,245,Parts should be hard to get from Simlim.
Chromebook,,,245,Hmm.
Chromebook,,,245,Is it a battery fault?
Chromebook,,,245,Your best bet would be parts from Amazon and self replace.
Chromebook,,,246,"Try to Google for :
1."
Chromebook,,,246,"Any online tech support forum for your Chromebook model, or
2."
Chromebook,,,246,Search for diagnostic tool to aid the trouble-shooting.
Chromebook,,,246,Maybe it's just a software configuration.
Chromebook,,,246,Also do check out Amazon on your particular model or similar models from the same maker.
Chromebook,,,246,"Sometimes the model's review section may provide some clues, or you could include your review & this battery issue you have."
Chromebook,,,246,Some Chromebook experts may respond with their solutions.
Chromebook,,,246,"As for SLS, can forget it as these people are just interested in selling machines with fat margins."
Chromebook,,,246,"Can search YouTube, iFixit & other similar tech repair websites for solutions."
Chromebook,,,246,"But first of all, do check out its user manual for troubleshooting tips & any online references, support forum, email support availability etc."

Chromebook,,,247,"According to this source:
The cost of replacing the motherboard are around US$110++, which I think is not economical Link:

Chromebook,,,248,"for battery problem, just unplug the battery wait a while and reinsert."
Chromebook,,,248,if someone has similar model

Chromebook,,,249,Yes.
Chromebook,,,249,"Remove the battery, clean up the battery contacts, then re-install it back."

Chromebook,,,252,Which HN is this?
Chromebook,,,252,I am trying to find a demo set for Asus C202SA
Chromebook,,,252,but I've not come across any shop in Singapore that sells this.
Chromebook,,,252,I guess it is almost impossible to find physical shops that carry a wide selection of chromebooks in SG.
Chromebook,,,253,"Is it the blue colour one HP stream 11"" for $299?"
Chromebook,,,253,"That one ish not a Chromebook, it's in Win10 and has 64Gb hdd"
Chromebook,,,254,HN at square 2 has HP chromebook.
Chromebook,,,254,I intend to buy in December.
Chromebook,,,254,Can call them to ask.
Chromebook,,,255,"Just to update, HP Chromebook 11 G5 is available at HN square 2 at $399, 1+4 yr extended warranty at $108."
Chromebook,,,255,Now 1 new set only.
Chromebook,,,256,Might be old version of C-book.
Chromebook,,,256,"Or old stock, beware!"
Chromebook,,,256,"My minimum display size at 14"""
Chromebook,,,256,so this one is no go.
Chromebook,,,256,Thanks for updating us HN.
Chromebook,,,257,I think 11 is too small and waiting for 14 to drop price.
Chromebook,,,257,Can get from HP online store.
Chromebook,,,258,"Yes, if you get 11"" C-book, you'll need to connect an external monitor for extended usage, otherwise your eyes will be under heavy strain."
Chromebook,,,258,"If Google don't move fast enough, they might lose out to the up & coming Windows 10S, Microsoft's version of Chrome OS, although it's rather unlikely this stripped down version of Windows 10 would be capable of built-in antivirus protection & seamless, hassle-free updates."
Chromebook,,,259,Chromebooks in SG are way overpriced.
Chromebook,,,259,I rather get it from Amazon Especially for their open-box sets.
Chromebook,,,259,"I actually preferred to use 11"" for portability, 14"" is just too big to bring out."
Chromebook,,,259,"TBH, if they're going with UWP and the Window store then I might give it a pass."
Chromebook,,,259,Later become the next Surface RT.
Chromebook,,,260,"Can buy from Malaysia, right?"
Chromebook,,,260,With one year international warranty.
Chromebook,,,260,"By the way, Seiko watch bought in Malaysia is also covered by Singapore warranty."
Chromebook,,,261,I think there is still an appeal for Cbooks.
Chromebook,,,261,The 10S imo is basically a restricted version of Windows limited by software restricted by a license.
Chromebook,,,261,Hardware wise if it comes with X86 /non arm components
Chromebook,,,261,it is more than capable of running software out of the Windows store.
Chromebook,,,261,But it's
Chromebook,,,261,"restriction is restrictive and unless imo is properly priced ..and strictly enforced by partner OEMs, will be a white elephant."
Chromebook,,,261,Take for instance
Chromebook,,,261,a Lenovo 100S or Asus H200A - these with full fledged windows are priced attractively already.
Chromebook,,,262,Do anyone know how well does windows 10 perform in low-end processors?
Chromebook,,,262,Last I heard they're sluggish and barely usable.
Chromebook,,,263,"If you are patient, then it is ok..."
Chromebook,,,264,@sendtolee
Chromebook,,,264,"Lol, if that's the case then never mind, Intel m3/i3 would be my bare min."
Chromebook,,,264,"In fact for Chromebook the N processor's are not smooth enough for me, min U processor or m3/i3 processor."
Chromebook,,,265,"When I use linkedin on both chrome and firefox with no other tabs and programs opened, it will be real slow and the cpu utilization will jump up."
Chromebook,,,265,The cpu utilization is also reflective of the slowness of the built-in graphics cpu.
Chromebook,,,265,Opening and closing program is fast using ssd.
Chromebook,,,265,But running a subroutine inside program is slow.
Chromebook,,,265,Hope this helps.
Chromebook,,,266,Reviews on Surface 3 Atom r generally positive.

Chromebook,,,268,z8300
Chromebook,,,268,so it is laggy when surfing firefox if you watch video.
Chromebook,,,268,However for note taking/office and surfing the net it has no problem.
Chromebook,,,268,"All these low powered devices work well with windows 10 after you disable unnecessary services eg tablet PC, disable hibernate, disable system restore, disable windows security center, disable windows defender."
Chromebook,,,268,"For example for my chromebook, I have 400MB ram usage on first bootup."
Chromebook,,,268,Also use firefox instead of chrome
Chromebook,,,268,What will be your usage?
Chromebook,,,268,You may not need to buy i3 after you trim windows 10 first.

Chromebook,,,272,Plug will be US 2 pin.
Chromebook,,,272,Just use adaptor
Chromebook,,,273,@harux89 Actually Amazon does ships to SG thru their AmazonGlobal service and there's lots of Chromebook under the service.
Chromebook,,,273,Try this link:
Chromebook,,,274,"A sad day, my Chromebook can no longer boot up and has a burned smell after a while."
Chromebook,,,274,Do you guys recon it can be fixed in SG?
Chromebook,,,274,Thanks.
Chromebook,,,275,I am confused about this actually.
Chromebook,,,275,Is that definitive list?
Chromebook,,,275,"Question is because in the item list, I see item A"
Chromebook,,,275,"and Amazon says that it is ""Eligible for shipping to Singapore"", but"
Chromebook,,,275,"when I go into the actual product page, it says ""This item does not ship to Singapore, Singapore."
Chromebook,,,275,Please check other sellers who may ship internationally.
Chromebook,,,275,""""
Chromebook,,,275,"wheres the Price still says ""$XXX.XX + No Import Fees Deposit & FREE Shipping to Singapore"""
Chromebook,,,275,"Anyways, I already pulled the trigger on ASUS C300SA."
Chromebook,,,275,Really budget model..
Chromebook,,,275,just intending to do some html/css/javascript via sublime on crouton.
Chromebook,,,276,"Or you can just put a recent Linux distribution on the Chromebook and completely not have to worry about performance, y'know?"
Chromebook,,,276,I have Fedora 23 running on a 9 year old Acer with only 2GB of memory with all the eye candy and animations
Chromebook,,,276,"turned on and that thing flies, even with a mightly slow 5400rpm HDD and the processor throttled to 525MHz."
Chromebook,,,276,And you still get the full desktop experience with all manner of desktop applications.
Chromebook,,,277,Anyone got the Samsung Chromebook Pro?
Chromebook,,,277,"Thinking of upgrading, currently using Acer Chromebook 14."

Chromebook,,,278,2
Chromebook,,,278,"Since used  for school work, internet may not be available all time."
Chromebook,,,278,so offline storage of at least 50GB is required.
Chromebook,,,278,Now a days all Chromebook do not have offline large capacity storage.
Chromebook,,,278,What are the options?
Chromebook,,,278,2.a
Chromebook,,,278,Can I buy 250 GB Micro SD /SD and slot in?
Chromebook,,,278,2.b
Chromebook,,,278,Is the performance is transparent?
Chromebook,,,278,2.c Is the Usability Access easy and convenient with Micro-SD?

Chromebook,,,278,Thank you
Chromebook,,,279,Suggest you get a standard notebook PC.
Chromebook,,,280,I used a chromebook in uni.
Chromebook,,,280,Not recommended for a tech-idiot.
Chromebook,,,280,Google's office suite lacks a lot.
Chromebook,,,280,You can use dropbox+ edit online via office 365 online.
Chromebook,,,280,But need wifi to do so
Chromebook,,,280,and if you're offline can't save.
Chromebook,,,280,Even online office 365 sometimes feel laggy.
Chromebook,,,280,"Before windows came to my chromebook, I had to install linux to use office 2010."
Chromebook,,,280,Even then its troublesome and I had to reinstall linux a few times.
Chromebook,,,280,"Long story short, just get a cheap windows 10 laptop."
Chromebook,,,280,Acer ones being sold at NTUC cost like $350 onwards which is reasonable.
Chromebook,,,280,Alternatively you can buy at lazada acer offical online store.
Chromebook,,,280,Currently you can get $60 credits if you pay via fuzzie app.
Chromebook,,,280,Buying a windows 10 laptop from manufacturers come with lots of bloatware and a lot of unnecessary processes running.
Chromebook,,,280,People get sick of their cheap laptops running slow.
Chromebook,,,280,"But if you take the time to read up on how to disable these things, windows 10 runs as well as windows 7."
Chromebook,,,280,"Take note that cheap laptops that comes with 32gb or 64gb storage do not have SATA, so you can't upgrade the hard drive."
Chromebook,,,280,"Buying a high capacity sd card looks good on paper, but not practical."
Chromebook,,,280,Sometimes the built in SD card reader gets disconnected and you need to reinsert a few times to get it working again.
Chromebook,,,280,You're better off with a microsd card reader+micro sd card.
Chromebook,,,280,Yes 11 inch is too small.
Chromebook,,,280,You cannot open pdf+word document side by side and read it comfortably.
Chromebook,,,280,"As for processor, when youre at the store, google the processor and make sure its quad core."
Chromebook,,,281,What budget are you planning?
Chromebook,,,282,Saw someone selling Dell Latitude E5250 for $450 on HWZ forums.
Chromebook,,,283,latest quadcore n3450 and 4gb ram for $399 at jurong point ntuc
Chromebook,,,284,@catherineteosg
Chromebook,,,284,As the others have mention
Chromebook,,,284,", it's best that you buy a standard laptop for your sister, she might not be able to get used to it."
Chromebook,,,284,A second hand laptop from Carousel can be considered if you're tight on budget.
Chromebook,,,284,Hope this helps.
Chromebook,,,285,"FYI, Chromebook sales on Amazon Prime day Link:
."
Chromebook,,,286,This is an Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C0GD..
Chromebook,,,286,anybody got this laptop?
Chromebook,,,287,Just to let you know the keyboard is not comfortable to type and the layout is not the standard type.
Chromebook,,,287,The battery quality is very poor as it will not be able to charge after 1 year.
Chromebook,,,287,This is my experience and it may be different from yours.
Chromebook,,,288,I  came across
Chromebook,,,288,"the budget Chromebook with 4GB Ram, 32GB flash, SD card."
Chromebook,,,288,The  processor  is   Processor:
Chromebook,,,288,Rockchip RK3288 Cortex A17 processor
Chromebook,,,288,compare  with
Chromebook,,,288,which one is better?
Chromebook,,,288,-
Chromebook,,,288,In terms of Processor.
Chromebook,,,288,-In
Chromebook,,,288,terms of performance.
Chromebook,,,289,intel is better
Chromebook,,,290,I agree x 2.
Chromebook,,,290,My Chromebook had a dead battery
Chromebook,,,290,and recently I found a company doing repair for Chromebook.
Chromebook,,,290,Being naive I went to seek their advice and had a bill shock.
Chromebook,,,290,They're called technofied pte ltd Link:
Chromebook,,,290,Consultation alone cost $100 Being called as deposit.
Chromebook,,,290,Then they quoted me for motherboard and battery replacement of $390.
Chromebook,,,290,I can buy a new Chromebook for that amount.
Chromebook,,,290,Learn my lesson the hard way.
Chromebook,,,291,This is a new model..
Chromebook,,,291,was urs the earlier Aspire 1 A114-31-C5Z2?
Chromebook,,,291,---
Chromebook,,,291,The keyboard is actually quite nice to type with leh
Chromebook,,,291,but the laptop seems a bit laggy..
Chromebook,,,291,those of u who have it..
Chromebook,,,291,does it oso feel laggy to u?
Chromebook,,,292,"I know many people are trying to buy the chromebook from Amazon and use it in Singapore, do you guys have any concern in term of warranty, is it an international warranty?"
Chromebook,,,292,What can I do in Singapore if the chromebook fail within the warranty period?
Chromebook,,,292,thanks.
Chromebook,,,293,buy another one
Chromebook,,,294,Buy a new one
Chromebook,,,295,"I am wondering is it what a buyer will do, -> buy item from Amazon, if it is faulty just buy another new 1?"
Chromebook,,,295,"But the Samsung chromebook pro I planning to purchase is around s$800, will be very risky if can't repair and no warranty in singapore"
Chromebook,,,296,$800 can buy a brand new i5 notebook in Singapore.
Chromebook,,,297,"$800 for an i5 notebook probaby gets you a thick cheaply built laptop, thick bezels, max 1080p display and no touch screen."
Chromebook,,,297,"On the other hand the Samsung Chromebook Pro is a thin and light 2-in-1 device, well built and with a bright 1440p display."
Chromebook,,,297,It also has a built in pen as a bonus.
Chromebook,,,297,"It really depends on usage, if you are just surfing the net, reading emails, watching videos the Chromebook is more than capable."
Chromebook,,,297,"If you need full programs like Photoshop, Microsoft office etc."
Chromebook,,,297,then you should consider others instead.
Chromebook,,,298,$800 is for $800 specs.
Chromebook,,,298,Haha...
Chromebook,,,298,$800 for chromebook?
Chromebook,,,299,As I said build quality is vastly different and you get a way better screen.
Chromebook,,,299,Some people don't need full windows programs and the Chromebook is a pretty good fit.
Chromebook,,,299,"Not to mention battery life, Chromebooks have easily"
Chromebook,,,299,"8+ hours, I'll be surprised if a $800 laptop lasts more than 6."
Chromebook,,,300,No thanks to a $800 chromebook.
Chromebook,,,300,Rather spend $800 on tablet.
Chromebook,,,301,Samsung chromebook pro is a 2-in-1
Chromebook,,,301,which means it can be used as a tablet as well with full andriod apps
Chromebook,,,301,but yeah
Chromebook,,,301,at the end of the day it comes down to preference.
Chromebook,,,302,$800 for my hp chromebook 13 ...
Chromebook,,,302,"totally worth it, imho"

Chromebook,,,304,-
Chromebook,,,304,No warranty in Singapore
Chromebook,,,304,so it is a risk if you intend to buy.
Chromebook,,,304,- Devices need USB C port.

Chromebook,,,305,"QHD screen
2."
Chromebook,,,305,"Very use-able 3:2 aspect ratio screen, although 12.3 inch screen, feels as good as a 14 inch screen with similar height too wide is wasted if you are not watching video."
Chromebook,,,305,3.
Chromebook,,,305,"Very versatile with 360 hinge, I use it in all 3 modes - laptop mode, tablet mode"
Chromebook,,,305,biggest tabletand
Chromebook,,,305,a reversed laptop keyboard facing down on the table.
Chromebook,,,305,360 is not very effective if the device is too big or too heavy.
Chromebook,,,305,This is just nice at about 1 kg.

Chromebook,,,305,Very fast boot up 7 sec and shutdown 3 sec.
Chromebook,,,305,"Unlike tablet, can afford to shutdown and boot up every time."

Chromebook,,,305,2
Chromebook,,,305,The Micro SD card can only be accessed thru' the inbuilt File Manager.
Chromebook,,,305,Android apps that you download from Google Play Store seems to be not aware of the card you only see internal storage folders.

Chromebook,,,305,Keyboard is not the standard windows layout.
Chromebook,,,305,There is no cap lock search button in place and no delete but only backspace button need to use Alt backspace.
Chromebook,,,305,Probably would not buy any more Android tablet but Chromebook.
Chromebook,,,305,"Don't have to worry about battery draining when not use, whether to buy a keyboard case or tablet stand or not, whether 10 inch is too small or not etc."
Chromebook,,,306,Reviews are very helpful!
Chromebook,,,306,Did you guys use any promo code when buying from Amazon?
Chromebook,,,307,since when does amazon has promo code...

Chromebook,,,310,Thanks
Chromebook,,,310,Thanks
Chromebook,,,311,Anyone knows if Dell is going to announce another Chromebook soon?
Chromebook,,,311,Any rumors?
Chromebook,,,311,The last one they released was in 2015.
Chromebook,,,312,What do you guys think of the Pixelbook?
Chromebook,,,313,way too expensive.
Chromebook,,,314,Reminds me to look back at Samsung Chromebook Pro instead..
Chromebook,,,314,"Still feels its over-priced, cant accept the pricing Google set for this set."
Chromebook,,,314,Maybe its my perception that Chromebook function is still less as compares to a standard Window laptop or maybe a MacBook..
Chromebook,,,315,I also feel it's overpriced.
Chromebook,,,315,Just like the new Pixel phones
Chromebook,,,316,"Hi, how much did you pay for your samsung chromebook pro?"
Chromebook,,,316,Currently here is the checkout price on Amazon:
Chromebook,,,316,Items: USD 497.00

Chromebook,,,318,planning to major in stats in uni
Chromebook,,,318,but idk if a chromebook is sufficient
Chromebook,,,319,"But somehow chromebooks loo not so ""nice"""
Chromebook,,,320,You need to use SPSS which cb cant run
Chromebook,,,321,"hmm what if i use the PSPP alternative on linux, or is that overdoing it"
Chromebook,,,322,Not detachable like what was said in the report
Chromebook,,,322,so let's wait for this
Chromebook,,,323,Mine was SGD$700 after currency conversion and via VPOST excluding GST SGD$60 plus shipping SGD$40
Chromebook,,,323,Thats a whopping $800 for a spanking new Chromebook Pro from amazon
Chromebook,,,324,How is the experience?
Chromebook,,,324,Was it worth it?
Chromebook,,,325,thinking of getting the pixelbook too..
Chromebook,,,325,but google is like apple.. paying huge price for their products.. especially for pixel products
Chromebook,,,325,"T.T
miss those nexus days.."
Chromebook,,,325,pricing good and good specs too..
Chromebook,,,326,Price aside...
Chromebook,,,326,"Even if I were to get, where should I get the pixelbook...?"
Chromebook,,,326,Amazon..?
Chromebook,,,327,"Here you go, from Amazon link:"
Chromebook,,,328,Thinking of snagging a Pixelbook as well.
Chromebook,,,328,"Not to run ChromeOS, but to wipe it off and put Fedora, Mageia or Debian Buster once it attains package freeze status on it."
Chromebook,,,328,Partly because I have never tried playing with Coreboot.
Chromebook,,,328,Anyone knows if a Linux distribution can boot with a Coreboot + Tianocore payload?
Chromebook,,,328,Don't want to use SeaBIOS since a new machine should be using UEFI boot and not legacy boot.
Chromebook,,,329,i also interested for a pixelbook but
Chromebook,,,329,the price most definitely pushed me away.
Chromebook,,,330,Anyone got the Asus c302?
Chromebook,,,330,How is it?
Chromebook,,,330,Sent from Huawei NEXUS 6P using GAGT
Chromebook,,,331,its either Pixelbook or samsung chromebook pro !!
Chromebook,,,332,"Btw, I am just curious..."
Chromebook,,,332,Is there any price difference if I were to get from Google store or Amazon...?
Chromebook,,,332,I am not sure if there is any difference.
Chromebook,,,332,It will be my first if I decide to get a pixel book...
Chromebook,,,333,"Hi Guys,
Would like to check for such refurbished units, in your opinion is it safe to purchase?"
Chromebook,,,333,Main use for laptop:
Chromebook,,,333,Youtube
Chromebook,,,333,Do some google doc work
Chromebook,,,333,Emails
Chromebook,,,334,I recently snapped up a used Acer r11 on carousell..
Chromebook,,,334,loving the experience of a Chromebook now..
Chromebook,,,334,but I still bring my 1hr battery life 2009 MacBook
Chromebook,,,334,pro
Chromebook,,,334,cos
Chromebook,,,334,im worried
Chromebook,,,334,if i have to do heavier stuff.
Chromebook,,,334,I bought this to test the usability of chromebooks and whether there is a future for me to use the pixelbook
Chromebook,,,334,and I would say I'm impressed
Chromebook,,,334,but I'm also just a 3 day old user..
Chromebook,,,334,"oh, battery life is amazing."
Chromebook,,,334,Sent from Huawei NEXUS 6P using GAGT
Chromebook,,,335,Saw alot of YouTube clips on review and unboxing of Google pixel book.
Chromebook,,,335,Any one here have ordered Google pixel book..?
Chromebook,,,335,"And which config you guys getting, also you guys also got the Pixel book pen..?"
Chromebook,,,336,I'm not very sure
Chromebook,,,336,"but I think the price differences will be little since it's a ""Pixel"" we're talking about Google Pixel ="
Chromebook,,,336,best/latest/expensive.
Chromebook,,,336,For warranty wise
Chromebook,,,336,I'm not sure if either will honor it or not.
Chromebook,,,336,That's the risk of buying overseas.
Chromebook,,,336,"To me it's not worth getting it as you're mainly paying for the ""Pixel"" branding."
Chromebook,,,336,You can achieve more by getting the other Chromebook like Samsung Chromebook Pro cost close to half of Pixel.
Chromebook,,,336,Just my 2 cents.
Chromebook,,,337,I would prefer to buy reburbished/used unit from Amazon warehouse as it's easier for me.
Chromebook,,,337,"Remember to check who's the exact seller, my used Chromebook had a defect battery which I used for a few month before it died."
Chromebook,,,337,"Nice, may I asked how much did you paid for it?"
Chromebook,,,337,Want to know the market rates.
Chromebook,,,337,Thanks.
Chromebook,,,338,I managed to get it at 300.
Chromebook,,,338,No warranty.
Chromebook,,,338,And no 100gb Google drive
Chromebook,,,338,cos he already redeemed it.
Chromebook,,,339,I do agree with you.
Chromebook,,,339,I have seen the Youtubers review on Google Pixel Book and they also commented that its actually not worth to fork out such a price to get an equally capable laptop or chromebook as there are many such option available.
Chromebook,,,339,"Kind of disappointed that google, Microsoft priced their hardware so high."
Chromebook,,,340,Can check with bros here using Chromebook if able to install chrome extension like shopback etc similar to using chrome on a windows notebook?
Chromebook,,,341,the samsung chromebook pro only 16gb?
Chromebook,,,341,if put a 64gb card will the system recognise and combine the storages?
Chromebook,,,342,"That's a little high, I think I can get a new one from Amazon below USD$400"
Chromebook,,,342,but at least you get to used it straight away.
Chromebook,,,342,"No choice, seeing the success of Apple with their branding, they're just following thru too."
Chromebook,,,342,Building their own branding in hopes to topple Apple.
Chromebook,,,342,Yup it can
Chromebook,,,342,", it's a browser OS."
Chromebook,,,342,No I don't think so
Chromebook,,,342,", it's not even able to store android apps on SD card yet"
Chromebook,,,342,if I'm not wrong.
Chromebook,,,343,if like that 16gb where got
Chromebook,,,343,"enough T.T
pixelbook got 128gb and 256gb but cost the same as windows 10 laptop.."
Chromebook,,,343,suddenly i feel pixelbook isnt actually overpriced..
Chromebook,,,343,its specs is top notch..
Chromebook,,,343,i5 with 128/256gb.. which should cost as much as a regular laptop already..
Chromebook,,,343,is just its installed with chrome os
Chromebook,,,343,thats why most people feel the price should drop..
Chromebook,,,343,chrome vs windows
Chromebook,,,343,os
Chromebook,,,343,i think chrome has the losing edge in terms of capability..
Chromebook,,,343,"that said.. besides its OS, specs wise, build quality wise, and aesthetically wise.. pixelbook pretty awesome.. ="
Chromebook,,,343,x might get the base model or top up about 300 more for more storage..
Chromebook,,,343,hopefully amazon comes out with some sale or
Chromebook,,,343,"what..
might get it for birthday or christmas present for myself xD"
Chromebook,,,344,Bought a Acer R11 some months back during amazon price drop for my kid to do her moe elearning homework.
Chromebook,,,344,Like the full-size keyboard without the number pad.
Chromebook,,,344,"The white exterior, black keys, very sleek and modern but can get dirty if you have dirty fingers."
Chromebook,,,344,"The laptop is heavier than expected at 1.3kg, probably due to the touch screen."
Chromebook,,,344,Surprise that Android apps on the Google Play Store is available on this chromebook
Chromebook,,,344,", therefore you don't have to rely solely on the Chrome browser to access apps."
Chromebook,,,344,"Installed kodi and android games, works pretty well."
Chromebook,,,344,"Playing marvel future fight is smooth, but too huge for the touch screen control and heavy if you intend to game for long for those actions control games."
Chromebook,,,344,"Connect from hdmi to my 65"" xiaomi tv is smooth, but can only support HD resolution and cannot display full HD."
Chromebook,,,344,I had yet to try chomecast.
Chromebook,,,344,The trackpad is not as responsive
Chromebook,,,344,"so I bought a wireless mouse, which paired perfectly."
Chromebook,,,344,Overall it is still a good buy for a chromebook that is flipbook with touch screen.
Chromebook,,,344,"On the last note, I realized that the mconline.sg my kid elearning portal still have some flash application, so still have to go back to windows for the occasionally usage, otherwise it is a superb laptop with almost 9 hrs of usage time on battery."
Chromebook,,,345,"Can buy other brand one, pixel is just overpriced."
Chromebook,,,345,"Awaiting for black friday sales, it's on sales on Best Buy for USD$179.90 during Black Friday."
Chromebook,,,346,Since when Samsung Chromebook Pro 16gb?
Chromebook,,,346,Its 32gb

Chromebook,,,347,Both Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus is on discount at Amazon -USD$100.
Chromebook,,,348,"Those installed linux on the Pro, can the rotate and pen input still work with no issues?"
Chromebook,,,349,"hi, can chromebook install those xinmin news paper app or toggle app?"
Chromebook,,,350,"I don't have a Chromebook to test, but as a Linux user I can safely tell you not to expect anything beyond barebones functionality for Linux on recent hardware until at least half a year later for the kinks to work out."
Chromebook,,,350,"WiFi and native resolution may work, but that's about it."
Chromebook,,,350,Case in point
Chromebook,,,350,"; the trackpad on my laptop still does not work on Linux after one year, even after compiling and installing the latest mainline kernel."
Chromebook,,,351,anyone has the Samsung Chromebook Pro to share their experience?
Chromebook,,,351,Thanks
Chromebook,,,352,anyone has a pixel book for sale?
Chromebook,,,352,"Using Samsung Chromebook pro now, wanna try the other  side"

Chromebook,,,352,Thanks!
Chromebook,,,353,"Hi,"
Chromebook,,,353,May I check what's the warranty
Chromebook,,,353,like if you were purchased chromebook from amazon?
Chromebook,,,353,There seems to have limited choice in Singapore.
Chromebook,,,354,Hi!
Chromebook,,,354,"I don't have a Pixelbook, but I do have an extra latest Acer Chromebook 15 CB515."
Chromebook,,,354,Completely BNIB and am selling slightly below retail.
Chromebook,,,354,Should you have any interest
Chromebook,,,354,", lemme know!"
Chromebook,,,354,Cheers
Chromebook,,,355,Hi all!
Chromebook,,,355,"I have an extra CB515 the latest Acer Chromebook 15 with upward firing speakers, quad core and touch screen."
Chromebook,,,355,A personal user of it and wanna say it's top notch.
Chromebook,,,355,"Should anyone have an interest, bump me a message"
Chromebook,,,356,"Hi, you can treat it as no warranty as none of the manufacturer provide international warranty AFAIK."
Chromebook,,,356,But if you buy one you should get those Chromebook that's sold directly from Amazon so that their CSO night offer a better response in your query for warranty support.
Chromebook,,,356,Just my 2 cents.
Chromebook,,,356,Cheers.
Chromebook,,,357,"The customer service at Amazon is pretty superb so while you might not enjoy full warranty they can probably arrange some degree of compensation, happened to me friend before"
Chromebook,,,358,I don't think there are any dealers locally who sell the Pixelbook.
Chromebook,,,358,I ordered one from Amazon
Chromebook,,,358,but I have not received it.
Chromebook,,,358,"It is an expensive device for what it is, plus there is no local guarantee."
Chromebook,,,358,This will be my first Chromebook and would be happy to report back on my thoughts after I use it for a while.
Chromebook,,,359,The better looking chromebook pricings are almost similar to a full fledged laptop.
Chromebook,,,359,Can't really make myself take the plunge..
Chromebook,,,359,Can i wipe a chromebook to install windows or do a dual boot if i dont like chrome os?
Chromebook,,,359,assuming i can upgrade the storage as well
Chromebook,,,360,Bought it during Black Friday in Nov
Chromebook,,,360,and I can say it has been amazing!
Chromebook,,,360,-
Chromebook,,,360,Very portable thin and light laptop.
Chromebook,,,360,- QHD resolution touch screen is amazing and very bright.
Chromebook,,,360,I have an Acer Chromebook 14 as well
Chromebook,,,360,and it looks dull in comparison.
Chromebook,,,360,=- 2:3 aspect ratio is good as well for potrait mode.
Chromebook,,,360,"Very good choice by Samsung here, if you use a 16 : 9 screen in potrait"
Chromebook,,,360,it just looks weird.
Chromebook,,,360,- Playstore app optimization is getting better day by day.
Chromebook,,,360,"- Keyboard is not as bad as some reviewers mentioned, I actually like typing on this keyboard once I got used to it."
Chromebook,,,360,- Only downsides I can think of are the speakers which don't get too loud and the bottom gets pretty warm sometimes but nothing to be worried about from the reviews I read.
Chromebook,,,360,"Overall I'll say it's a perfect laptop for surfing the web, youtube, checking emails and etc at around $700"
Chromebook,,,360,+.
Chromebook,,,360,I can safely say there are no Windows 2-1 thin and light equivalents at that price point.
Chromebook,,,361,Check this page out if you intend to do so
Chromebook,,,361,but it's very troublesome.
Chromebook,,,362,Happy CNY
Chromebook,,,362,everyone.
Chromebook,,,362,I am interested to get a Chromebook for my primary school kids.
Chromebook,,,362,"Anyone know if it will work with MOE eLearning websites like MCOnline, Xuele and eZhishi etc which I believe still runs on Flash."
Chromebook,,,362,Thank you.
Chromebook,,,363,same here...
Chromebook,,,363,lol.
Chromebook,,,363,thinking about getting this
Chromebook,,,364,"Yes, Chromebook support flash."
Chromebook,,,364,"Having said that, mconline flash implementation might be a bit buggy when using chrome."
Chromebook,,,364,"Based on my kids experience when using mconline and other elearning sites that uses flash, if they encounter flash not working or buggy, I've tried the following potential solutions for flash compatibilities:"
Chromebook,,,364,Site settings >
Chromebook,,,364,Flash > Allow.
Chromebook,,,364,Try deleting the browsers cache and cookies.
Chromebook,,,364,Try using the Google Chrome in the incognito mode.
Chromebook,,,364,"If that works, then temporarily disable your extensions to identify which one is causing the problem."
Chromebook,,,364,To do this go to chrome://extensions and uncheck Enabled for each extension one by one.
Chromebook,,,364,Reset your Chrome settings to default.
Chromebook,,,364,"Last but not least, if all else failed, switch back to windows."
Chromebook,,,365,Thank you for sharing your experience.
Chromebook,,,365,Now I need to rethink if it is worth the trouble.
Chromebook,,,366,"So far it is still fine, quite rare to use Windows for mconline as most 3rd party elearning platform the school are using are going to html5."
Chromebook,,,366,"My recommendation is to get a budget chromebook with touch screen that is 13"" - 11"", cost should be around USD 200-250."
Chromebook,,,367,"Thinking of getting a Chromebook, the Chromebook 15."
Chromebook,,,367,But nowadays I worried that the laptop comes dead on arrival.
Chromebook,,,367,Have you all had such experiences?
Chromebook,,,367,Is there any way to mitigate the risk?
Chromebook,,,368,"Buy from amazon, if dead on arrival can return back to amazon and they will refund you the money and shipping back cost."
Chromebook,,,369,Bought 3 Chromebooks from Amazon and so far it has been great.
Chromebook,,,369,"One of it has a small scratch on the side though, but"
Chromebook,,,369,"after a while, I dun notice it anymore"
Chromebook,,,370,hi all.
Chromebook,,,370,"I have a Acer C720, used since 2013."

Chromebook,,,372,-8H-C3BY from the Acer Official Store on Qoo10 for S$399.
Chromebook,,,372,"With the S$30 cart coupon, it can be yours for S$369!"
Chromebook,,,373,Why not get the new HP Stream with Celeron N4000?
Chromebook,,,373,"Better CPU than the Acer, proper Windows and also $399."
Chromebook,,,374,"Don't bother, you're better off buying on the internet."
Chromebook,,,374,So far only ASUS has them on their brochure
Chromebook,,,374,but it's a Chromebox.
Chromebook,,,375,"Wife's requirement is for internet surfing, Google spreadsheet drive etc."

Chromebook,,,378,Read the reviews for C302CA
Chromebook,,,378,"and it's good, worth to buy if you're into Chromebooks."
Chromebook,,,378,However for Spin 11
Chromebook,,,378,"I'm not sure, it's just another normal Chromebook with android support."
Chromebook,,,378,C302CA will be faster then Spin 11 by alot.
Chromebook,,,378,Hope this helps.
Chromebook,,,379,any idea how to get chromebook to auto connect to the free wireless@sg ?

Chromebook,,,406,How is chrome os reliability with android apps currently ?
Chromebook,,,407,Chrome OS is very light weight and build for online and cloud computing purpose.
Chromebook,,,407,With the integration of android apps it have the best of worlds of having the huge android apps collections.
Chromebook,,,407,The downside of android apps on chrome OS is that apps that are touch screen based or not compatible with chrome OS will have some issue.
Chromebook,,,407,"Meaning if the apps require touch screen, you will need to have a touch screen chromebook else navigation will be painfully difficult."
Chromebook,,,407,"Similarly for some apps are use to work for certain version of android, and it will not work for chrome OS if the programmer did not update the apps to be compatible to chrome OS."
Chromebook,,,407,"Infact, I had changed my parent windows laptop to chromebox for more 5 years already."
Chromebook,,,407,During these 5 years I do not have to deal with desktop support issue that are common for windows.
Chromebook,,,407,The only 1-2 occasion is due to chromebox auto update that changes the UI which my parent need some help to find the icon to shutdown the chromebox.
Chromebook,,,407,"Overall, chrome OS is for folks who need something portable to connect to internet for media consumption and office computing in the cloud."
Chromebook,,,407,"As it is light weight, chromebook hardware are relative cheap, reliable and long battery life due to very little power consumption from the os and hardware as compare to Windows and Mac laptop."

Chromebook,,,427,Samsung Galaxy Chromebook
Chromebook,,,427,Asus Chromebook Flip
Chromebook,,,427,Google Pixelbook
Chromebook,,,427,Go
Chromebook,,,427,Also here is a sneak peek of the upcoming one from HP
Chromebook,,,427,It is just unfortunate that they are getting expensive for this year models.
Chromebook,,,427,How is your experience like working from home with a Chromebook or your kid's experience doing HBL?
Chromebook,,,428,"If just for web browsing, HBL, video conference, Netflix, documents/"
Chromebook,,,428,slides/spreadsheets...
Chromebook,,,428,Chromebooks are more than sufficient.
Chromebook,,,428,"If wanna install loads of apps or gaming, go win/mac laptops, otherwise if only above scenarios would be a waste."
Chromebook,,,428,Especially if many family members do not want to take turns to use the laptops.
Chromebook,,,428,Couple of cheaper Chromebooks used concurrently make more sense.
Chromebook,,,429,Chromebooks have.
Chromebook,,,429,that Google enforces and is beyond the user's control.
Chromebook,,,429,"After the expiry date is reached, all updates even security updates to the unit will be stopped."
Chromebook,,,429,Decide whether that is something worth living with.
Chromebook,,,430,I don't find that a big deal.
Chromebook,,,430,"Its not like you won't be able to use the Chromebook after the expiry date, its just no more new updates."
Chromebook,,,430,"If you are IT savvy, you can install CloudReady ChromeOS with support for old hardware, just that Android Play Store won't be available."
Chromebook,,,430,I have installed CloudReady on a 2015 Lenovo X1 Carbon 3rd gen laptop and its working beautifully for my kids to access the school learning website.
Chromebook,,,430,Everything works without any further fiddling.

Chromebook,,,433,Chrome os don't run android apps well too.
Chromebook,,,433,"For me, if Ms office is a must, get windows or mac os."

Chromebook,,,435,"Imo, i rather use windows on the x1 and have a separate drive for cloudready."
Chromebook,,,436,It's not tat cheap as old thinkpads cost roughly the same.
Chromebook,,,437,Cloudready doesn't support multi-boot anymore.
Chromebook,,,437,Haven't tried if it's workable.
Chromebook,,,437,"After using Chromebook, it's quite  liberating not to worry about security or updates."

Chromebook,,,438,chromebooks are not worth it anymore.
Chromebook,,,438,"In 2013 you could buy the basic acer c720 for less than
, or less than 200 shipped to Singapore."
Chromebook,,,438,"Later acer came up with fhd 1080p 15 inch ips laptop acer chromebook 15 for less than usd 300, and Toshiba Chromebook 2 - a 13inch fhd ips with 100% panel for less than usd 300."
Chromebook,,,438,"Both can be bought from amazon, use forwarder, less than 400 sgd."
Chromebook,,,438,"In that time, it was not possible to get such specs at the price and the cheapest brand new laptops were $600, and fhd ips panels were more than $1000."
Chromebook,,,438,They can also be bios flash and install windows.
Chromebook,,,438,Acer also had upgradable ssd.
Chromebook,,,438,"Nowadays, may be better to spend on used third gen thinkpad, replace battery and maybe screen, total less than 300."
Chromebook,,,438,Or there are fhd ips chinese laptops in lazada for less than 400

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,450,Dont buy laptops without warranty.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,451,I ordered 1 from
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,451,Microsoft USA i7 version stil waiting fo shipment.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,451,Us$1349
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,452,ship via forwarder?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,453,Yup Going to ship via comgateway
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,454,Do keep us updated when you receive it.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,454,The only.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,454,issue.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,454,is the US-pin charger
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,454,"but since it uses usb-c to charge, can simply buy those 45w usb-c charger from lazada."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,454,"The microsoft store got updated with new stock, priced at 1499 for the i7."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,454,"With shipping fee, should be just a little over 2k sgd."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,454,Very tempting.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,455,"Yup sure, Actually once you factor in shipment and gst , it is going to above"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,455,2K ...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,455,but well you can’t buy any laptop on the market now with just 2K that has this kind of specs.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,455,3:2 format is great!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,455,"Power shouldn’t be a problem since it used usbc charging, this means usbc power banks will work as well."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,455,"I saw the surface book 2, but it’s disgusting that the basic model at 2188 isn’t even 8th"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,455,gen. Same goes for the surface laptop still 7th
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,455,gen.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,455,I might have gone for a surface laptop if it had been a 8th gen.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,455,"One thing for sure , even if they sell in Singapore it’s not going to be at the price I’m paying...."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,456,"out of curiosity, did you manage to order from the microsoft.com site?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,456,"I tried to buy using comgateway and alternative forwarder services MyUs, etc and order never goes through."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,456,Contacted MS and they told me they wont ship to forwarders; MyUs has separately confirmed this.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,456,So was curious to know if you found a workaround?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,456,Thanks!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,457,"3:2 is a great aspect ratio, that I agree."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,457,I am using a Lenovo Miix 720
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,457,and I like the aspect ratio myself.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,457,"I don't deny that buying it locally will not be cheap, but buying a laptop for more than 2 grand without warranty is a big risk."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,458,Anyone adventurous enough to buy from taobao?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,459,Touch wood I have Bought 10 over Laptops
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,459,so far it’s been good....
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,459,worst case can send back to USA
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,459,I suppose
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,459,"I saw the miix 720 , but nowdays it’s basically no thin vezel"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,459,no talk ....
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,459,haha
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,460,"Hmm I didn’t know this, I was charged the amount on my credit card ...."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,460,otherwise can wait for amazon?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,461,U need steel balls
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,462,Just throwing it out there.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,462,"If you have to pick between the Matebook X Pro and the X1C 6th gen, if both are the same price, which would you go for?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,462,The reason for this is that I can kind of get the X1C at roughly the same price as the Matebook through my organisation at around 2k+.The upside
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,462,is that lenovo has the warranty support for 3 years.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,462,"However, the Matebook has that gorgeous display and aspect ratio."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,462,Keen on opinions.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,463,I’ll prefer the Huawei due to the 3:2 factor.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,463,And 91% bezel to screen ratio
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,464,Where can I demo it in  Hougang ?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,465,Where can I demo it in  Hougang ?

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,474,"Just add to your cart, the price will automatically change to student price Le."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,474,"Just to add on , compared to my dell xps 13...."

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,475,How do u guys arrange shipment?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,475,What are ur shipping costs to Singapore?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,476,They use freight forwarding services like comgateway.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,476,Microsoft will ship to the provided address and then the company will ship the thing to you.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,476,"As an update, I've decided to be kiasu and go with the X1C6 instead, with 3 years warranty, a bit more than what would've cost me for the Matebook."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,476,Really such a waste they don't offer this locally..
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,477,I got an i7 US set from a seller on Carousell.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,477,Keyboard is a bit shallow compared to my previous daily driver Surface Book 1
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,477,but still okay.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,477,"Other than that, everything looks and feels solid."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,477,The screen is terrific!

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,480,I was asked and the I gave my sg card details but still failed placing order.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,480,"Do you need to first send money to PayPal in USD, or simply deposit SGD?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,480,Thank you
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,481,You create a PayPal account and link your card to the account.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,481,"Then on Microsoft website, you just log in using your account credentials and agree on the charges."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,481,"If you're filling in details on Microsoft website, it isn't PayPal."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,482,WAh how much did you pay to the scalper on Carousell?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,483,Shipping with gst about 200 express via comgatewAy

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,485,I managed to place the order with Microsoft US.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,508,most of them are praising how laptop remained cool.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,508,only one review says that it does heat up once in awhile.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,518,ship back is easier than ship in cause u can have the battery removed
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,519,Heat is definitely going to be an issue with very thin laptops.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,519,"In fact, the numbers you mentioned sounds better than expected."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,519,Is that referring to the laptop surface temps or the actual CPU temps?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,519,"I suspect the laptop may also be transferring some heat to the chassis, which will cause the surface temps to be quite high."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,519,Couple
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,519,"more things you will need to consider are, what is the ambient temp and where did the user put the laptop, i.e. is it on the bed where the vents are blocked."

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,653,Any recommendations for chargers?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,653,Thanks!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,654,You can just get the travel adapter I linked in one of the earlier post.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,654,The charger has a tight fit into the adapter
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,654,so it's practically one piece now.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,654,No need waste money.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,654,Haha.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,657,Looks promising!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,657,But have to ownself find the UK plug for input right?

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,667,Shipped by Amazon
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,667,"Lastly Carousell got seller selling as low as $2,350 for i7."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,668,what about warranty matters if it needs repair?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,669,Im also using this one  and it works great!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,669,"AUKEY USB Charging Station, 60W"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,669,Power Delivery 3.0 &
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,669,"Dual Port USB Charger for MacBook/Pro, Dell XPS, iPhone X / 8"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,669,"/ Plus, Samsung Galaxy S8 / S8+ / Note8 and More"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,670,Erm... I think user here dun really bother about the warranty...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,670,Otherwise they will buy other models locally or models with international warranty?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,670,"I'm using this, bought $79 from Comcenter vending machine"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,671,"Sorry I'm a noob, can someone explain what this is?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,671,Charging because this is from USA so need something different?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,672,"Thanks Mr lin, do you know anything about the charging"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,673,Nope.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,673,"You can just use the charger provided, with a universal adapter to fit SG socket."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,673,That's what I did.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,674,You can use the original charger it works in Singapore just that you need an adapter.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,674,Most of us are getting alternatives because we want a charger with UK plug.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,675,Thanks everyone
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,676,Oh Mazer cant ar....
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,676,regarding this Im
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,676,not sure.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,676,But Im quite like its small size.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,677,curious why are u selling?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,678,Prefer MAC OS.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,678,Have been using for 5 years already.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,679,I have just put mine up FS at Carousell too.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,679,"Very satisfied with it, just that I got a Cobalt Blue Surface Laptop for dirt cheap and found that I don't really need the Matebook's extra power."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,680,"OT a little, anyone has the Huawei Matebook D 2018?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,680,How's it?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,681,Still going strong.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,681,I recommend this too
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,682,Who says you need to spend $2K on any laptop?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,682,This Huawei Mate X is not a good deal.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,682,Its got no touchscreen in 2018!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,682,still using Intel CPUs when the AMD Ryzen is way better and selling like hot cakes everywhere else in the world.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,682,Windows laptops that don't have touchscreens should be priced much lower.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,682,The best laptop now is the HP Envy x360 13z 13 inch.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,682,"Its a touchscreen 2-in-1 convertible and has a Ryzen 5 2500U which means that while its CPU performance is comparable to the Intel i5 equivalent, its GPU performance is 3 times faster Firemark score of 2000 vs 700 pts."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,682,10 hr battery life too.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,682,Saw it at Harvey Norman late August and its already all sold out!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,683,"Hello, this is Matebook X Pro and not Mate X."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,684,This model like not in SG hor.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,684,Posted with Audeze LCD-X HardwareZone Forums app
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,685,"It's not offered by Huawei Singapore, but there are numerous export sets available for sale on carousell."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,685,"A bunch of us already got ours, and have been using it for the past month +."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,686,The biggest nonsense you hear are from people who think that you have to spend a lot more than 2K to have anything decent.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,686,Which explains why idiots buy Apple products for example.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,686,"Currently the best deal on the market is the HP Envy X360 13"", which has everything touch screen, convertible 2-in-1, ultralight 1.27kg & slim, powerful and only starts at $1399 or so as an exclusive at Harvey Norman at Comex."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,686,Yet the AMD Ryzen 5 2500U has 3 times the GPU performance compared to the equivalent Intel i5.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,686,People who tell themselves they need to spend a lot on IT typically just don't know IT.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,687,Waiting on my brand new set from Microsoft!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,687,Just wanna share some of my exp.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,687,My card was declined a few times when i was attempting to make payment via PayPal.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,687,Called bank
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,687,and i was told no issue with my card but no records of transactions were made at all.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,687,I was gonna give up
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,687,and then a final try to simply make payment directly to Microsoft
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,687,some users had problems with Microsoft before that apparently Microsoft do not accept foreign cc.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,687,It went through!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,687,I was still skeptical though.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,687,The charge went through and appeared in my statement but the order status was still pending.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,687,Today morning I receive an email from Microsoft that my order has been shipped and is on the way to CGW woohoo!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,687,"FYI, order was made on Sep 5, so it was processed within 3 days."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,687,"To all others who have been using your Matebook X Pro, any tips to share on your usage?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,687,Accessories to get etc?

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,688,"Take your shrilling elsewhere, man-child."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,688,You're cluttering up this thread with irrelevant evangelising.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,689,Can share how to get such off?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,689,I got no student/military account.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,690,actually i dunno how i got the discount too.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,690,there was a button to check your eligibility.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,690,when you click on it it asks you to sign in to your Microsoft acct.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,690,"after i signed in, it says i'm eligible"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,690,and i got the discount!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,690,i must have been a member of SEAL Team Six in my past life or something
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,691,What is the domain you use?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,691,like @military.gov or something @polytechnic.com?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,691,etc..
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,692,my email?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,692,eh gmail.com
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,693,I went to google and found the $150 off is general doesn't need to be student/military.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,693,How much does your shopping cost?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,694,i think the dob of the user matters too
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,695,not sure yet
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,695,but CGW estimated it will be
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,695,USD58.45
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,695,so about SGD80?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,695,though i am planning to combine and use their onebox to save on shipping.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,696,haha prolly.. maybe we got senior discount
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,697,What is the actual shipping cost for using cgw?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,698,Is this a good price to buy from Amazon?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,698,"It is estimated at SGD 2,365.80 including shipping and tax."

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,702,Bought this sleeve new pro 13 inch
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,702,"A1706 size, liking the ability to prop the laptop up a bit."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,702,"However, sleeve is a bit too big for the laptop, and there is at least 2cm of excess space with the laptop inside."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,702,"Looking for other sleeves with a tighter fit, that have this same function."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,702,Anybody else bought sleeves for theirs?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,703,Anyone using cwg to ship from US?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,703,Is the weight at 5.5kg or more?

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,708,"Just use the original charger with a universal adapter, like I did."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,708,"I found one that fit quite snugly into the charger, so it's essentially just one piece."

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,730,1
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,730,Just unscrew at the laptop base
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,730,"All screw can be seen, there's no hidden screw behind the sticker or rubber feet."

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,735,That’s ok since he is selling at an ok price.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,735,He would not give u order confirmation email as well and in case you want send back Microsoft for servicing on your own.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,735,There’s no way you can do it.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,735,Just get on your own from Microsoft with educational pricing.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,749,I'm not sure
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,749,but I believe it's different.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,749,Buying from Malaysia doesn't mean Huawei SG covers the warranty also
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,749,", you need to bring it back to Malaysia."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,750,Seem like my harddisk is liteon.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,750,Sent from Huawei Mate RS...

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,753,I think july
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,753,Sent from Huawei Mate RS...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,753,Blah Blah... using GAGT
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,754,How to test the r/w speed?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,754,"Also, u guys upgraded from W10 Home to Pro?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,Stock SSD depends
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,u got Toshiba or other brands..
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,"if you dun update ur windows, Toshiba XG5 is ok"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,Write speed 1K - 1.2K
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,But this also means that u need to set every new wireless connection to metered limit to prevent it auto update and cannot use lan connection.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,I tried downloading Microsoft software to hide update
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,but dunno why still got updated.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,Window 10
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,Pro should be able to block the update...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,There's free software to test ur speed eg.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,CrystalDiskMark.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,"If you dunwan to change, you got to wait for MS"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,", Toshiba update or ok with the write speed."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,Just to share with you my cost for 970Pro.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,Comex 512GB with free printer at $349.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,Printer sold $100
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,XG5 sold $120
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,755,So I only paid $129 and did a clean installation instead of cloning.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,756,I intend to upgrade to W10 Pro
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,756,and I hope SITEX will have SSD sale for the Eco 970 Pro
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,757,What read/write speeds are you getting with the 970?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,757,"I'm on the fence about whether to change or not, since the Liteon one is sufficiently snappy for me."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,757,"In case anyone is interested, this was the result I got when I ran it in the first week or so of using the Matebook."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,758,ur Liteon dunnid to change.....
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,758,Toshiba XG5 Specs:
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,758,"UP TO 3,000 Mb/s read / 1,050Mb/s"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,758,write
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,758,"I can get approx 2,7xx mb/s & 1,1xx mb/s"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,758,"After window update, 2,7xx mb/s & 4xx mb"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,758,/s
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,758,Samusng 970
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,758,Pro
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,758,I just run the test
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,758,"3,512 mb/s & 2,307 mb/s"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,758,"But although bought from oversea, I believe warranty is still valid if u shipped back?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,758,"However if u change the SSD, most likely warranty will void as u need to removed a small sticker covering SSD screw."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,759,I felt that my liteon lag when transferring files or activate program.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,759,Sent from Huawei Mate RS...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,759,Blah Blah... using GAGT
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,760,So warranty is void since u replaced the ssd?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,760,I hope my is a lite-on ssd
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,760,so dun need to buy the EVO
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,760,Cant decide to get the Evo or the Pro
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,760,"My usage is primarily research surfing, Edmw n Ms word/excel n going bukit timah"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,761,Ya.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,761,U enlarge and saw that screw tighten to SSD?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,761,Supposed to have a small round white sticker.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,761,Perhaps u can try to remove slowly to avoid damaging it.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,761,"And as for Evo or Pro, depends on ur needs and promotion."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,761,My previous calculation for Pro is $129.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,761,"If I were to get Evo 970,"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,761,Comex price $269.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,761,Sold my XG5
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,761,120
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,761,I would pay $149 for Evo with free $20 voucher which is same or higher than Pro because the $20 voucher u couldn't sell at $20.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,761,So it doesn't make sense to get the lower specs at same price.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,761,"However if u managed to remove the sticker without damage, u may want to keep the SSD that came with for warranty purpose..."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,762,if u want warranty repair in singapore how do u do about it?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,763,You can't get warranty in Singapore.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,763,"If you really want to claim warranty, need to send back to the US."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,764,Anyone using the Logitech T630 mouse ?

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,770,"The only thing I did was to undervolt it using XTU, so now the fan almost never turns on, and the whole thing runs a lot cooler and very very quiet."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,770,"The whole 7-9 second boot time still amazes me, every time I switch it on."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,770,"Also, in case some people here don't know, default is set to Function key on, then only can use F1-F12."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,770,You can actually remap/swap the button to be Function on then can use the Function Keys.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,770,It's in the Huawei app on the laptop.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,780,Got difference?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,781,Hello all I am thinking of getting a Matebook X Pro i5 thru a friend from Shanghai.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,781,Was wondering if I need the version with the discrete graphics card?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,781,"My primary concern is battery life, to do work on MS PPT and Word and net browsing in general."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,781,The integrated card would suffice right?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,782,Will Huawei bring in the laptop to Singapore?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,782,They just announce to bring in matebook X pro and matebook d together with new phone mate 20 to Malaysia.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,783,"If you're only using it for those, then the integrated graphics card should be sufficient."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,783,"I bought the i7 one, not because of the MX150, but rather for the 16GB ram and extra ssd storage though you can just swap out a larger ssd on your own ah, since I need the extra ram, due to the kind of programming work I'm doing."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,783,"The battery life, for me personally, is quite great."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,783,Don't think so.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,783,"I've emailed them in the past about it, but they said they have no updates yet."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,783,Maybe you can email them now.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,784,"Thanks bro, for the reply."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,784,Can I ask a further question - was your i7 model purchased from the US or China?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,784,I read online that some users had difficulties with the fingerprint sensor after they did a clean install of English Windows 10 home via the USB Media Tool.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,785,It is not even 1.7k USD where did you get that figure from.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,785,With educational pricing about 1.349k
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,785,The seller doesn’t even provide any receipt if the buyer want to claim warranty on their own.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,CPU:
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,Intel Core i7Style:
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,Laptop Only
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"To preface this review, I've been using this laptop for about a week now."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"I bought it from the Microsoft Store not Amazon, in case you're wondering why it doesn't say ""verified purchase""."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,GOOD:
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,=- Design: this is a Very good looking laptop.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"The dark grey color is pretty much identical to the ""space gray"" that Apple uses on their MacBooks."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,- Battery life:
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,excellent.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"Watching youtube, editing documents, and other light productivity work yields about 8-10 hours of use."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,=- Display: Very bright and easy to use outdoors.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"Not quite as bright as the new MacBook Pros, but close."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"Color accuracy is skewed towards the reds, but that can be fixed with calibration."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,- Keyboard: MUCH better than Apple's new keyboards.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,Very quiet comfy to type on.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,It feels very similar to the Surface keyboards which is a good thing
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,- Speakers:
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,Excellent sound.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"The bass could be better, but the sound is very clear and can get fairly loud."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,=- the SSD is upgradable.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"Not easily upgradable, but it's not soldered in, which is a plus."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"If anyone is wondering, my unit has a Toshiba SSD."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"Write speeds are poor, around 300MB/s, read speeds are decent at around 1800MB/s."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,NOT SO GOOD:
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"=- build Quality: After a few days of use, the laptop started to creak when I pick it up."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"I tried tightening the screws, but that didn't fix it."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,Very irritating.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,The USB C ports are also VERY tight.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,It feels like I'm going to break something when I remove the charging connector.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,-
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,Port arrangement
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,": This is a minor one, but I wish they put one USB C port on either side instead of putting both on the same side."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,This would make it possible to charge the laptop from either side.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,=- Price
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,: I think $1499 for the 512gb model is too much.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"At the time of writing this review, Amazon is including a $300 gift card, and that makes it easier to swallow."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,THE TRULY AWFUL:
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,- Webcam:
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,I can't think of a single scenario where using this webcam would be acceptable.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"Even for just casual video chatting, it's awful."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"I like that it can be hidden, but the positioning makes it impossible to get a ""normal"" view of your face."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,Not to mention the actual camera quality is poor as well.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,It's a 1MP camera.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,- Touchpad:
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"It's a Precision touchpad, but it sure doesn't feel like it."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,It doesn't even compare to the Surface touchpads.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"Even the ""click"" is very cheap feeling."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"Not to mention, the touchpad rattles quite a bit."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,Not what I expected for a $1500
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,device.- Coil Whine:
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"Similar to the older Dell XPS 13, this unit has quite a bit of coil whine."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,It's amplified when plugged in.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"This is pretty unfortunate, but some people won't notice it.- Fan Noise:"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,It's pretty much always on.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"It's not obnoxious, but it's loud enough to hear it in a very quiet room."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"If the laptop isn't plugged in and is on power saver mode, the fans do quiet down."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"On almost every other laptop, the fan is actually connected to a metal heatsink."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"On this laptop, there's about 0.5cm of space between the fan and the heatsink."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,This is just bad design and incredibly inefficient.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"As for what comes in the box, you get:
-"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,The laptop.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,- Power brick.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,- 2m long USB C cable
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"- A USB C dongle with VGA, USB A, HDMI, and charging passthrough."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"This DOES NOT support 4k@60hz, but hey, its included."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,TL;DR
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,: This machine is 90% of a MacBook Pro for ~70% of the price.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,"It's a great value compared to a Mac, but compared to other Windows laptops"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,", I think it's priced too high, especially for a ""new"" brand like Huawei."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,Leave a comment if you have any questions
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,830,and I'll do my best to answer them.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,831,"I encounter none of the problems listed above, in the review on Amazon."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,831,"The fans are almost never on, and if they are on, it's very quiet."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,831,"The touch pad is very sensitive, in my opinion."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,831,"I find myself opting to use the touch pad even though I have a wireless mouse, at times."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,831,No coil whine or touch pad rattle like what's reported.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,831,I've been using it almost every alternate day
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,831,since I got it in late-August.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,832,Same here
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,832,No such problems on mine

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,841,"Freebies besides the Office365 5user license, Huawei Bluetooth Mouse, Huawei Backpack, Huawei leather case & a 10% Off discount voucher for Huawei products valid till 31Dec 2018"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,841,", I guess for purchase in MY, I think."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,842,Unboxing it now and leaving the packaging at MY Home.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,842,"Bringing this back to SG tomorrow SG damage is around $2,320."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,842,Not bad
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,842,"I think, plus warranty is 2 years I guess in Malaysia but that is ok for me"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,842,", I commute frequently to Malaysia anyway."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,843,SSD is Toshiba or Liteon?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,844,"Yes I did, with matte black skin."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,844,"My first time applying, did quite a bad job imo."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,844,"But oh well, live with it first"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,845,Can’t answer now.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,845,"But I doubt so, the material quality looks good."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,845,But you can do a google on dbrand and see if there are negative reviews on post-removal.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,846,Installation hard?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,847,Not as easy as I thought.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,847,Think of it as a skin rather than a cover.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,847,So precision is important.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,847,"Of course, can always peel and redo until perfect but takes a lot of effort."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,847,"dbrand has good tutorial videos by the way, they have a detailed video for Matebook X pro itself."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,847,"For those who are keen, shipping took about 1.5week"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,848,"Ic, last time I can’t remember which brand I tried for iPhone and iPad, ended when I removed the iPad Apple logo tarnish stain Because use wet installation method and stain can’t removed."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,848,This one which logo cut out is good
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,849,Nice.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,860,The Ground pin can be pushed down flushed with the power brick.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,862,the only thing that she didn't like was the backpack which I will keep for myself.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,868,vs 16:9  better for youtube and netflix hor
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,869,"It comes free with Huawei Bluetooth mouse, I am using MacBook Pro"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,869,"what you saw on the photo is my macBook Pro which is for my own use, the Huawei MateBook X Pro was bought for my daughter's use, it happens that I took the photo in front of my MacBook Pro."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,870,Oh... cos I thinking of getting that mouse
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,870,but online got mixed reviews and need download special drivers for windows and like not fully functionable
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,871,That’s really nice.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,871,Hard to find this kind of plug in 65W
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,872,Can consider mx master 2S or Anker ergonomic mouse
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,872,I rotate between them very good.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,873,Im looking for slim type and find Magic Mouse is cool haha.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,873,currently own mx master 2S and Microsoft comfort sculpt for home and office.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,874,Maybe Logitech anywhere 2s also good.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,874,Magic Mouse is indeed very slim but not easy to adapt.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,874,Find it tiring to use but good thing can use lightning cable to charge.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,875,"Anywhere I owned the 1st series before,"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,875,its good and 2S should be better
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,875,Ya Magic Mouse cons and pros.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,876,If anyone want let go their 65w Huawei PD charger UK plug
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,876,let me know
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,877,Can we use mbp15's charger to power up or charge the matebook x pro?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,878,MY sell the 3pin power brick as an accessory?

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,885,How much u all pay for shipping from US Microsoft to SG
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,886,I'm contemplating because of the warranty as this is not a $100 product
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,887,buy buy buy!!!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,888,Lol u really funny...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,888,"if warranty is an issue, u can just forgo this model instead of wasting your time reading thru overseas reviews."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,888,Else Malaysia is your nearest option for time being.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,888,SG
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,888,so far no news and
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,888,much earlier post did mentioned they might be available to dump here when newer model is coming out.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,888,But I doubt SG price is cheap and the price might make you reconsider other models.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,889,Usd 150 for shipping is really no joke
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,889,sia...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,890,Includes gst
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,891,Includes gst....
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,892,The new MacBook air made me laugh.....

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,893,"ya man..start with 128gb ssd, really joke..."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,893,keep saying amazing...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,894,Does anyone have pictures of how the leather sleeve look?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,895,This is the smallest and lightest charger for USB-C 60w laptop and can charge mobile phone and tablets as well.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,895,"Otherwise, I think the Xiaomi 65W is the cheapest charger:"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,896,Different.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,896,No way would phone charger come up to 65W
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,897,First option is expensive and don’t do 65W
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,897,But still a good option.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,897,Second one is the 2 pin.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,897,I think use the original Huawei 2 pin one can le
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,898,But the iPad Pro seems good
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,898,"If the announcement was made earlier, I might get the iPad instead of Matebook and not sell my itx rig"

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,899,Can consider this beast
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,899,I’m using this at home at the moment but still searching for the original Huawei Uk plug charger
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,900,What good is it when you can't use it with a mouse or trackpad?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,900,You will tired your hand moving around a big screen.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,900,"Furthermore, no headphone jack."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,900,"if you add it up with the keyboard and the pen, it is so expensive."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,901,"I need something that is portability, can watch movies and some simple excel work over the weekend out of house."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,901,"Happens to see good reviews for matebook, so got it after considering to sell my rig."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,901,"No regrets getting it, just that iPad is lighter"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,902,"For light laptop, both LG Gram 13 or 14 are less than 1 kg and with long battery life."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,902,iPad Pro 12.9 with the keyboard would probably exceed 1 kg.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,903,Wah you already got a ITX rig ah.....
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,903,so now you'd get the external GPU for gaming?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,904,"The Xiaomi 2 pin doesn't have the ""holes"" you usually see in the flat 2 pin plugs."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,904,So doesn't really plug in very securely.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,904,I am using this:

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,905,"I 'm using this,"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,905,"But they say is total output 65w, not USB C 65w."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,906,No disrespect just sharing what I observed at Tech Show
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,906,"Lenovo Yoga S730 can be had for $1,799."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,906,Whiskey Lake i7+ 16gb

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,907,Yup but no dedicated graphics card
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,908,Yup I was considering this as well.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,908,Price point for that specs is not bad.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,912,Im also monitoring hwmxp and newer offering with whiskey lake.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,912,The lack of warranty with high usd exchange rate combination is a show stopper for me.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,912,"Btw, the lenovo brochure shows 1999."

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,924,for now i'm still holding off my purchase since i mainly charge at home.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,924,usage still quite low outside.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,925,"This is fake 3pin, i.e. plastic top pin, so it won't be grounded."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,925,"At this price, the Mazer is a better buy with an additional QC3.0 port."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,925,The Aukey also looks like a fake 3pin charger?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,925,"So far I only found this Lenovo 65W charger:
and the MacBook USB-C charger provided you buy the extension cord."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,926,"I just received my i5 model and started it up today, but found that Windows 10 is really laggy and stuttering."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,926,"The only changeI did was to delete my D drive partition, so as to enable Windows 10 to run on the full 256GB of SSD."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,926,Should I wait for a couple of days and monitor to see if it gets better?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,927,Leave it on for a full day.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,927,Update all your drivers via the Huawei app.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,927,New laptops are generally a bit slow for the first couple hours since it's running all the updates in the background.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,927,My matebook x pro is still as snappy as when I first got it 2 months + ago.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,928,Thanks bro.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,928,I also disabled my panel refresh which helped a lot with the stuttering in chrome browsing.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1091,you will need t5 hex screw driver for bottom cover plate & mini philip head screw driver for the heatsink
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1091,Just to make sure the screws are separate accordingly to the layout as they are different sizes.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1091,two types for the bottom cover plate & three types for the heatsink excluding fan.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1091,The video should covered the below mentioned.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1091,-
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1091,"After unscrewing the bottom cover plate, run the guitar pick along the sides then the top with the bottom facing up."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1091,=- the stickers at the bottom cover should indicate the orientation.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1091,=- Lift the bottom cover from the top side by sliding upwards and top direction as There is a catch near the sticker area.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1091,Failing to do so might break the catch.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1092,Thermal paste/pad fix will void warranty right?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1092,I haven't done any thermal fix before but am inclined to do so for this laptop - I'm just lacking experience on this..
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1092,Do you think it's easy to screw things up for first timers?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1092,@randy
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1092,=- mine will arrive early next week.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1092,Expedited shipping.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1092,"For units from Amazon, my guess is warranty claim if any is dealt with Amazon or Huawei USA, not Malaysia."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1093,yes.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1093,think huawei US would void it.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1093,Very few laptop companies allowed such mods with warranty.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1093,I had the laptop for two-three weeks before i did the mod.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1093,So it was not giving me problems earlier
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1093,and i dont expect it to be later as well.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1093,i was not comfortable with the temp as the keyboard get pretty hot to touch near the screen.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1093,Now it is warm when loaded which is fine for me as i have directed the heat toward the bottom cover.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1093,I have to lift the back a little for airflow when using it.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1093,I had tons of experience with PCs
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1093,but it was my first time with laptop.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1093,So mileage might differ.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1093,Just make sure you have all the equipment before doing the mod.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1094,You can just undervolt it using Throttlestop.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1094,"It helps a bit, I guess?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1094,"Also, for those who have yet to get theirs, I can't over-emphasize how much I love my Matebook X Pro."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1094,"My unit is on 8-9 hours a day, 5 days a week, since mid-August."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1094,"So far, no issues whatsoever."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1094,It's really worth every penny spent.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1094,"Also, it needs mentioning that the dongle thingy that they provide is really solid."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1094,"Most dongles can get quite hot over extended periods of use, but I haven't encountered anything like that with the included dongle."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1094,"I have a second display via the dongle using VGA, which is on 8 hours a day as well."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1094,"For me, since I do quite a fair bit of programming and simulation, I find that it really helps to get a laptop cooling pad even more so for the Matebook X Pro since it has a metal chassis."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1094,Best $10 spent.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1095,Dunno why throttlestop has been freezing my
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1095,x
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1095,whenever i reboot.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1095,Thus i deleted it from x. Strange.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1095,Sent from Samsung Galaxy S10+ PRISM WHITE using GAGT
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1096,Gotten a toshiba nvme ssd set.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1096,Well llst
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1097,How to buy from Amazon?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1097,Direct?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1097,Any GST?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1097,Sent from Sony D6653 using GAGT
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1098,Will be taxed for sure.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1099,Toahiba no good?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1100,=+ install RateX on Chrome browser.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1100,Pay using RateX's USD the exchange rate is better than using Amazon's.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1100,Do note that the price on Amazon fluctuates a lot every other day.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1100,Best to set up a camelcamelcamel.com price tracker and monitor.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1100,For me I set it to notify if it drops below US1200 and pulled the trigger at $1199.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1100,Missed the $1139 deal.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1101,Liteon SSDs are supposedly better.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1101,"This was my read/write speeds, ages ago."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1101,"3k read, 2k write."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1101,The Toshiba one has supposedly sub-1k write speeds.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1102,"That time Toshiba NVme got issue after Windows update, the Read & Write speed drop tremendously to turtle speed."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1102,Now I'm not sure
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1102,cos I had changed to Samsung Nvme 970 Pro long ago.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1103,Many many updates after that still not corrected?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1104,wah i learn a lot from this post alone...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1104,got such thing as camelcamelcamel ahahhaha
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1105,I ordered at 1199 but amazon for some reason went and cancelled my order so now I'm waiting for the price drop again.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1105,Haizzzz
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1106,still cannot update to MS 10 1809 right?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1107,glad my post helped!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1107,There are also Amazon price tracker apps you can download.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1107,At least there's a couple on Google Play store.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1107,My i7 $1199 unit arrived today!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1107,Ordered on 13th
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1107,"Apr. Total damage $1,798.05 Sing dollars include priority shipping + tax."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1108,any matte screen protector to recommend?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1108,the screen is pretty reflective in bright environment.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1109,You can install it at Sim Lim Square.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1109,That's where I installed mine.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1109,"I don't really recall the shop number though, but I remember that it was 4th floor, and it was some corner shop."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1109,"When I was asking around for laptop screen protector, the lady asked if I wanted clear or matte."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1109,"They don't sell any pre-sized screen protector for our laptops, so they'll need to measure out and custom cut from a bigger piece."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1109,Cost around 20+.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1110,Does it affect the clarity of the screen?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1110,like blurriness of the words.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1111,I installed the clear one.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1111,No issues encountered whatsoever.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1111,"In fact, it's ness smudgy now."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1111,Lesser fingerprints on the screen.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1112,Thanks. will check them out.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1113,Might want to consider tempered glass protector as well although the con is that its not going to be matte.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1113,Read that the screen is quite sensitive.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1114,I don't think tempered glass SP is advisable since that will mean you can't fully close the laptop.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1114,How do I know this?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1114,"I am currently using those rubbery/jelly-like keyboard cover for the Matebook X Pro, which is super thin, and even then, when I open up my laptop every morning on my desk, I can see the prints of the square key-caps on my screen."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1114,I don't carry my laptop around.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1114,I only close my laptop lid every day before I leave my desk.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1114,This is what leads me to believe that the Matebook X Pro actually closes quite flush with everything inside.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1114,"I imagine that if you have a tempered glass SP, it might either hurt the screen since tempered glass SPs are generally thicker than plastic/film SPs, or the keyboard; especially so if you carry your laptop around when closed."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1115,Guys
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1115,My mate book
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1115,pro x is not charging even when the charger is plugged in.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1115,I tried using both USB C slots but no use
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1115,Any advice please?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1116,Try this.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1116,Open PC manager ->
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1116,Power Management ->
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1116,Power optimizations ->
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1116,Others ->
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1116,Battery Protection:
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1116,Choose Family Mode or Office Mode or Travel Mode
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1117,"Battery depleted, faulty charging unit, etc"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1118,"If you're using the included charger, make sure you plug the usb-c cable properly into the charging brick."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1118,There needs to be a click-type of feeling at the end.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1119,I like the Huawei Matebook X Pro
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1119,is just thin enough to allow for a USB-A port on one side.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1119,Cool bros!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1120,try swapping the direction of the usb-c cable.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1121,BTW I am using the Aukey charger that was recommended by some of the users here.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1121,Back to using stock
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1121,and so far its charging
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1122,"If that's the case, then the Aukey charger is what's faulty, and not the Matebook X Pro.."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1122,"Another thing to try with the Aukey charger is to plug it into the laptop, turn on the charger and give it a couple seconds."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1122,Sometimes it takes 5-10 seconds before it starts charging.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1123,My one is still going strong.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1123,When this happen either cable or charger first culprit
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1123,What powerbanks are u guys using?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1123,I use the Xiaomi powerbank gen 3 and recently.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1123,bought the omni usb c with wireless charging for my AirPods
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1123,the latter is expensive but 2 USB c ports.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1124,about the 20k xiaomi powerbank.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1124,how much juice can you get from it to charge the matebook laptop?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1124,My charges are.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1124,20 to 70 = 50%.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1124,20 to 90 = 70%.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1124,6 to 78
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1124,= 72%.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1124,Is there something wrong with it?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1125,Maybe not calibrated yet?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1125,Drained it to 0 and full charge will give u more accurate reading
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1125,I didn’t really track the reading as I got 2 units of the xm powerbank and they were really cheap for what they are capable of.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1125,When I bought it was about $50 from here
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1125,That being said I only charge my matebook x pro when it is below 20% and when it is done I can get near to full bar
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1125,also I use the laptop while it is charging so
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1125,can’t really tell how much juice it gives
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1126,I use the Aukey charger on the new macbook pro with no problems
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1126,Maybe the Aukey
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1126,no like the mate book lol
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1127,I tried without using the laptop and tried to charge with a single unit of xm powerbank - gotten 77% from 2%
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1128,thanks for the feedback.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1128,75% that was almost the same as mine.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1128,thought i had a lemon.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1128,Looks like i need to get something more powerful.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1128,Thought 20k was sufficient for a single charge.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1129,Hard to find something more powerful.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1129,If u want higher capacity - weight and cost also go up.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1129,No value proposition.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1129,This one sweet spot.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1129,"For heavy users, 2 units just nice - 1 at home and another 1 at office."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1129,If not just fully charge up ur laptop and bring the powerbank out.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1129,Last u for 1 day for sure enough.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1130,my heaviest usage can only last 2hr on full battery.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1130,Now playing with remote desktop access offloading the heavy work to the remote PC to see if i can prolong the mileage.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1131,Seems a bit odd that you're only getting 2 hours.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1131,"I'm running simulations and stuff like that every day on my laptop average 20-40% CPU utilisation, with brief peaks at 80-90%."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1131,Worst I've seen was 4 hours on a full charge.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1131,"On a normal day, I can get by with close to 8 hours."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1132,Could be the intel gpu and mx150 usage.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1132,I am using game engine and modelling program.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1133,Getting the newest model in.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1133,Will sell away my current set soon
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1134,Mine doesnt save the settings..

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1136,When will the new 2019 models be out?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1136,Will Huawei Singapore bring in the notebook models?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1137,Huawei Singapore will be carrying but not sure when.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1138,how much u looking to sell for.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1138,I'm trying to get a set and alr had an order placed wif amazon
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1138,but they went and cancelled my order so now I waiting for the price to drop again.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1138,Idm buying second hand if the price is reasonable
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1139,I’m actually bringing in the 2019 model.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1139,Us market only have the 2018 for now.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1140,I mean that I'm looking to buy ur 2018 model seeing that u are looking to sell it soon.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1140,Hahahaha
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1141,Yeah would like to know the 2018 model pricing too.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1141,By the way how much is the 2019 i7 model?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1142,Brand new i7 2018 model is going for $1780 on Carousell.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1142,So cheap nowadays.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1143,but the seller for 1780 Mia hahaha
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1144,There's also a couple other sellers all selling around that price mah.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1144,"Personally, anything under 2k is already a very good deal."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1144,"A lot more than what I paid for mine, back in August."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1144,Hahaha.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1145,I think at this point best to wait for the new model.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1145,I predict late May to early June should come out
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1146,The new model has a starting price of around 4-500 higher than when the original 2018 model came out.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1146,"This is because the first one was so popular, so they know they can charge a higher price for the newer ones."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1147,Just received the 2019 set
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1148,May I know where you got this and what is the damage?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1148,Thanks

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1149,means coming soon officially
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1150,From China.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1150,Maxed out specs.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1150,About 2.2k after shipping and taxes.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1150,"Actually really feel the same just that this one 4 lane thunderbolt, Huawei logo looks fantastic as compared to previous one,"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1150,has Huawei share feature good for those using Huawei phone - useless for me
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1151,Agree with this.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1151,I feel they will price it similarly to XPS 13
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1151,The i5 close to 1.9-2 and i7 may well be over 2.4-2.5
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1152,u reinstall the Windows to English by full formatting?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1152,where u get all the drivers and software from?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1153,"if you factory reset the machine, wouldn't it revert back to the Chinese OS and Drivers?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1153,Very nice price of $2.2k though
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1153,", I seriously doubt it will be anywhere close when it lands on our shore."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1153,"At least 2.6, 2.7."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1153,2018 model is more worthwhile - unless money is not an issue
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1154,There are actually few ways to go about changing the language be it full wipe or just changing the language and keeping the stock applications.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1154,"Stuff u may need in the process include oem key, thumb drive, etc,."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1154,The stock Drivers and applications
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1154,u can easily find it on
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1154,Drop down from the list and choose the correct model
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1155,Easiest is to just buy oem key and change yourself.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1155,"There's a couple videos on YouTube relating to that, specifically relating to matebook x pro."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1155,"The key is under 20 bucks, from lazada or something like that."

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1164,"If that's the case, might as well buy from carousell."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1164,Just wanted to ask cause
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1164,I saw some got it from the states for around just below USD1200.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1164,But I'm not sure from which platform though.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1165,The Matebook is coming to Singapore.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1165,"Those that haven't purchased, should wait out for the it show."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1165,"Unfortunately, the x pro isn't here yet; only the Matebook 13."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1166,"Yup, At least find out what the pricing is and decide which is better subject to personal criteria"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1167,Pricing is already out.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1167,"In my opinion, this is very cheap, especially considering what else is being offered in Singapore."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1168,"Frankly, im a little worried about Huawei laptops"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1169,"Hijacking this thread, anyone know where I can get the Honor Magicbook with an AMD processor ?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1169,It's so hard to find a retailer and aliexpress sellers aren't glowing with good reviews either.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1170,Here's hoping the SG models come with touch screens.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1170,Otherwise the prices are still a bit higher than what you can find in China.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1171,I m selling
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1171,...pm me
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1172,?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1172,i already got mine.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1173,Matebook 13 battery is mediocre though.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1173,Rather they bring matebook 14
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1174,"This isn't a buy/sell thread, guys."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1174,Please keep those out of this thread.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1174,Thanks.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1175,Matebook X pro looks really attractive.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1175,I almost go for it!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1175,"But then, now the US-CN sager."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1175,"IMO, it better to hold back purchase until they make news that Microsoft do support Huawei laptops in the long run."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1176,How many built-in features are we losing if we were to reinstall Windows OS and not to install any Huawei drivers or their PC manager software?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1177,Launch in Singapore has been postponed.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1178,MateBook 13 sale in pc show is postponed as well?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1179,Dont think its coming already.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1179,"After google android ban, Microsoft windows should be next."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1179,Lucky this was before SG start selling the matebook.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1179,If not surely a lot of refund / return
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1180,Definitely a no-no to purchase this.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1180,"Once Microsoft withdraw the licence for Huawei to utilise Windows OS, the laptop will be considered running pirated OS, which if used in SMEs, can lead to a lot of fines or penalties"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1181,Good opportunity to buy cheap for home use though haha.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1181,Imagine matebook x pro resale price as people get rid of them or retailer clearing stocks.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1181,2011
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1181,HP fire sale anyone ?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1182,here we go...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1182,Microsoft removes Huawei laptop listings from its online store
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1183,Just when I thought of getting the latest model.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1183,Any alternative that can compete with huawei in terms of spec and weight?

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1185,Mod edit:
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1185,Ad removed
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1186,Will avoid previous gen MateBook X Pro..
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1186,"If you read online, many units suffer from loose trackpad and overheating.."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1186,High temperature destroys electronics earlier.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1186,And the lack of warranty in Singapore may be a concern..
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1186,"Furthermore, the Huawei USA saga.."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1186,Better to wait for more clarity..
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1186,I think Huawei recognised the overheating problem and changed the fan design for the 2019 model.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1187,Huaweis pending MateBook X Pro and Matebook 13 launch in Singapore up in the air
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1188,potential Windows ban is coming to matebook.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1189,Wonder if they will still sell at next week PC show??
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1190,"Wish they would, maybe even give discount to clear stock."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1190,Some would still buy due to matebook hardware / price ratio.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1190,"Not everyone overly concerned with US ban, can always install Linux if need be."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1191,Maybe can email Huawei sg to ask
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1192,I asked the sales staff at the Huawei booth in CEE.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1192,The guy said tentatively the laptops are on hold pending further decision from the senior management.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1192,I'm planning to snag one in China.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1195,A port to charge other stuff concurrently.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1195,Just to note.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1195,"I'm using this charger, but the USB C cable, I still use the Huawei one that's included."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei,Matebook,1195,"If you're having problems with PD chargers not charging your laptop, it could be a cable problem, and not so much a charger problem."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1243,Here's my customised specs:
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1243,Processor :
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1243,"Intel Core i5-9300H Processor 8MB Cache, up to 4.10 GHz."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1243,Backlit Keyboard Blue Top Printing Black English
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1243,"After eCoupon and those $0.10 / $1 deals applied, getting it at $1160.20."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1243,So end up it only cost $1056.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1243,I think it's really worth it
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1243,and I haven add in CC rebates too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1243,I wonder if student can get more discount?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1243,Hoping to receive some feedback on the laptop if possible.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1243,Think i'm getting over the weekend
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1244,Any bros here have review on this lappy?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1244,@Extremme
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1244,": I'm looking at the same config, and want to add memory so total 16GB"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1244,So far not possible.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1244,If want 16GB can't get 7200 rpm Hard drive under the customise option.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1244,: The blue backlight can turn on and off?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1244,: Is there Optane memory?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1244,@petshijie
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1244,: Are there eCoupons?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1244,I didn't see
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1245,"I'm also considering this as worth well, but problem is gtx 1050 may not last long for future gaming."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1245,It barely can make it for modern gaming liao.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1245,"But for light and old games, should be OK ba."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1245,I thinking of whacking the aftershock apex lite.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1245,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1246,It was stated an increase of 50% performance from 1050 to 1650.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1246,"Not sure how true, but avg fps is around 40 vs 50"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1246,+
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1246,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1247,"Yeah for gtx 1050 it isn't meant for gaming at high performance but rather games that I don't mind set it in low quality maybe dota, csgo, apex legend?."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1247,I'm using it mainly for schoolwork
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1247,"so I think this is just nice, besides I have a desktop meant for gaming already."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1247,I won't really wanna game on a 15.6 inch laptop
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1247,maybe occasionally play haha.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1247,Anyway apex lite is another pricing tier already.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1247,"If you have budget for it, I think just go for it!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1247,"But bear in mind they don't really have discounts on their website, such as coupon code, shopback and CC rebate cash"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1247,is cheaper apparently.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1247,Erm there's this popup on their website that ask me sign-up to their newsletter.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1247,"I just provide email and spin the wheel, they gave me code."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1247,Can get up to $100 off.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1247,Maybe try looking around their website for the popup?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1247,Still hoping to get reviews on this laptop too!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1248,@petshijie
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1248,:
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1248,Nope.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1248,No popup on their website.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1248,"Btw, I've pm-ed you."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1248,: Found this review on youtube.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1248,@Hayate84
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1248,: I'm using the laptop mainly for work and light gaming.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1248,Maybe I don't need GTX1650 after all
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1248,"Anyone knows where I can get this machine L340 gaming, i7 with 16GB memory?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1248,The standard one is with 8GB.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1248,No option to up memory so far.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1248,Customize option don't have 7200 rpm Hard drive.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1248,"Battery life is important for me, so I prefer L340 gaming est."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1248,9hrs over Legion Y540 est
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1248,5hrs
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1249,Gaming laptop
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1249,I think can only dim back light but not off.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1249,for graphic I chose gtx 1650.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1249,"I am mainly letting my son ply fortnite, PUBG etc"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1250,Hmmm i not sure if the customised option is providing you the gaming version
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1250,but i can pick i7 with 16gb on it.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1250,Yeah the customised option doesn't have 7200rpm hard drive.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1250,I probably go with the SSD instead.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1250,Anyway thanks for pm-ing.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1250,i replied you there.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1250,Can anyone enlighten me with the difference between this two regarding SSD?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1250,whether TLC or not is better?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1250,"512GB Solid State Drive, M.2 2280, PCIe-NVMe."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1250,"512GB Solid State Drive, M.2 2242, PCIe-NVMe, TLC"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1251,i just got the laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1251,The keyboard backlight can be turned off
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1251,Also does anyone know how to toggle with this?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1251,between quick and quiet mode?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1251,"""The IdeaPad L340 has two distinct modes: ‘Quick’ for gaming and ‘Quiet’ for working."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1251,"Each mode looks, feels, and acts differently."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1251,"Simply flick between the two based on what you need to do."""
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1252,Nice!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1252,I went to check out the stores yesterday to see the machine.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1252,Not available yet at Best Denki.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1252,Called Challenger
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1252,", they say don't have."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1252,Anyone went down to CEE yet?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1252,There have?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1253,Anyone knows the ecoupon for Lenovo?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1253,I thought I saw something like CEE
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1253,***
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1253,2 days ago
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1253,but there doesn't seem to be any listed on their L340 or other product pages now.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1254,Still can't figure out how to toggle quick and quiet mode.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1254,Google also not much help in this case.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1254,Might have to call their technical team tomorrow
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1255,Any difference between the l340 gaming and l340 build your own??
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1255,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1256,"No difference i guess, it's on the same page."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1256,Anyway i just ordered mine.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1256,Here's the customised specs i picked.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1256,"●  Intel Core i5-9300H Processor 8MB Cache, up to 4.10 GHz."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1256,●  Windows 10 Home 64

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1256,●  Keyboard Backlit Black English.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1256,"Cost me $1097 after eCoupon, think after shopback 9% if successful not too sure because apply"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1256,eCoupon might not pass shopback?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1256,my final spending is $998?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1256,Less than 1k for this really sweet deal for me.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1256,Hoping it arrives within next week.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1256,"Oh yeah, not forgetting CC rebates for shopping."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1256,Really good
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1257,L340 Build your own does not have 7200RPM Harddrive option.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1257,Bros here can give your opinion?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1257,Which would you choose?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1257,7200 RPM Harddrive + 8GB RAM.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1257,or.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1257,5400 RPM Harddrive
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1257,+
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1257,16GB RAM
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1258,What ecoupon did u use
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1258,may I ask?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1258,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1259,It's not stated if they're giving you 1x16GB or 2x8GB if you order 16GB RAM but either way
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1259,there's not much real world difference.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1259,"I would take 16GB over the 7200RPM drive because if they give you 2x8GB, at least you're getting a matched pair rather than you having to source a single 8GB"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1259,should you want to upgrade in future.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1259,"2.5"" 7200RPM are plentiful and prices look to drop as time goes by."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1259,Just checked:
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1259,"Dynacore SRP for WD Black 1TB 7200RPM 2.5"" is $129"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1260,Yeah agreed.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1260,Buying Ram is much better than drive since it's unknown about 1 or 2 ram stick they're putting.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1260,"If I'm not wrong, shopee has good tech deals on the drive."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1260,Just look out for it if you aren't urgent.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1260,I pm you instead!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1260,Check your inbox
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1261,Can those who got their laptops post some real life photos?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1261,this model is so new that no one did an actual review on it yet
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1261,😣 would be good if you guys can provide some comments on the performance with the i7 model and if it thermal throttle
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1262,oh and does anyone know if the battery ia different between the customisable option and the pre configured version?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1262,"the customisable one is 3 cell cylindrical smt, 45wh?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1262,the pre configured one is 3cell lipo or smt iirc..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1262,its advertised up to 9 hrs of battery life which is almoat impossible with just 45wh..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1263,"I suspect as long as it is L340 gaming customise, the battery and shell is the same as the pre-configured machines."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1263,"I've checked and if you are on the page with L340 gaming and click the option to customise, you won't get the optical drive that comes with L340 non-gaming machine."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1263,They should have just labelled the customise option as L340 gaming customise.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1264,[QUOTE=
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1264,petshijie;120987594]Yeah agreed.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1264,Buying Ram is much better than drive since it's unknown about 1 or 2 ram stick they're putting.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1264,"If I'm not wrong, shopee has good tech deals on the drive."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1264,Just look out for it if you aren't urgent.]
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1264,I'll just get what is available without too much trouble.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1264,Lovely if I have the time to customise a machine myself.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1264,Maybe in the future.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1264,"Totally ideal, can put in whatever i want"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1265,I don't see it anywhere that mention ODD on the l340 gaming page.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1265,Hmm yeah they should just put all the model there as L340 gaming  and not cause confusion to customers.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1265,Anyway best to chat up with their agent for better clarification.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1265,"There's not much to customise for laptop, especially if you still want to retain warranty by the manufacturer."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1265,Would best to do that once you past the warranty period.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1265,"Once i received my laptop, i will post some photos and a quick review here."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1265,Mine isn't the i7 model and i not sure if i will experience with thermal throttle newbie at setting it
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1265,"but i will try gaming it for awhile, maybe on mid-specs just to see what's my frame rate like on FPS game"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1265,Edit: Just got notified that my cashback is recorded.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1265,$98 from that 9% cashback.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1265,Luckily didn't go down CEE show for the laptops.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1266,You can google PSREF L340-15IRH to see the spec.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1266,"16GB max offering / 2400MHz DDR4, optional 4GB memory"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1266,"soldered to systemboard, one DDR4 SO-DIMM socket"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1267,I see..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1267,"cos for the l340 gaming laptop model page where you can choose pre configured models or customise your own parts, the battery is labelled differently"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1267,so i thought of asking here to see if anyone knows abt it haha
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1268,Nice cashback!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1268,Able to stack with lenovo's promocode?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1268,the one you get with the spin at their page?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1268,thanks for the photos and review in advance.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1268,tho probably will get before end of the 9% cashback ends
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1269,"seems like you guys were right, the battery is the same capacity no matter if its preconfigured or customised.."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1269,"according to the specs sheet, its 45wh."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1269,Dk
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1269,how lenovo got to 9hrs battery life for a laptop with 45wh battery.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1269,with its i7 model i am hoping for at least 2 hours of editing or at least 4 hours of light work
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1270,Wow thanks for finding that out!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1270,They should put this up on the product page so its easier to reference from.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1270,"Yeah, I applied eCoupon lenovo promo code first and with shopback cashback turn on."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1270,Anyway i got better discounts from lenovo chat agent rather than the spin wheel.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1270,You should chat up with them and see if they can provide you with discounts.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1270,Credits to intel888 bro from telling me!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1270,"9 hrs is the maximum battery life that the computer can hold under everything setting to lowest brightness, the minimum program running on memory, etc ."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1270,i7 core runs at higher performance and eats up more since it has 2 more core than the i5 though not at a noticeable rate but
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1270,ideally if you're gaming this could make a really small slight difference.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1270,"I believe anywhere between 1.5 to 2 hours for heavy programs game, vid edit and 4 to 5 hours of normal work should be okay."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1271,Thanks guys for sharing.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1271,"Sorry  as I'm using app, I don't check my inbox often."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1272,not sure if the battery needs conditioning
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1272,haha...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1272,I received the laptop on Sat and did some normal working but does not seem very impressive when it comes to battery life
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1272,"and I am only turning it to half mark and not fully utilsiing the ""performance"" standard of the laptop and battery setting."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1272,Well but it has a function for rapid charging.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1272,My son tried to use it to play Fortnite and he was complaining that he can only turn the graphic to medium or something else it will lag.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1272,"Ok I am not a pro..last time when I was young, I dont even use gaming laptops."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1272,Maybe I did not turn on the gaming mode which I dont even know how to do that.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1273,"wow, how much discount did you get from the chat agent?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1273,in terms of percentage
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1273,hahaha 😁 feel free to pm
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1273,"if you dw to say it out publicly, am interested to know since i am getting it this week"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1274,I realised you chose the i5 version of the l340 gaming..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1274,hahaha still can choose to have 16gb of ram?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1274,"I cannot tho, only can choose up to 16 when i7 is selected"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1275,Erm
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1275,"yeah, i have to deselect the 4gb RAM onboard, then i'm able to select 16gb RAM SoDimm."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1275,Here's my customised specs and the pricing i got.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1276,", I got a nice price!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1276,Looking forward to receive my new toy
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1277,PMed you!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1277,"This is the exact same config I am planning to get, tho I am still considering between the 1050 or 1650.. am afraid that the 1650 will produce more heat"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1277,and then the whole system will thermal throttle in this relatively thin chassis.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1278,"Ya, the heat was my concern too."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1278,So I chose 1050 to play safe.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1278,Have replied your PM.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1279,What's the effect of thermal throttle may I know?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1279,I also wish to get 1650...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1279,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1280,thermal throttling basically mean that the cooling system of the laptop is not able to dissipate the heat generated by the components in the laptop and
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1280,the cpu/gpu gets so hot to the point where it runs at a lower clock speed in order to generate less heat and run cooler.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1280,hence you are not able to get the full performance the laptop and its components can offer.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1281,Noted about this.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1281,But how do we know which kind of laptop is capable of disatting heat effectively?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1281,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1282,Hi can pm me the code as well?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1283,Still holding my horses because still thinking whether to try the 1650 GPU anot... 😂
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1284,"Bro, pls check pm."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1284,Wanted to get this laptop as well.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1284,Thanks.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1285,OK!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1285,I couldn't hold it anymore.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1285,Pulled the trigger because this deal is really good.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1285,Here's my specs.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1285,"●  Intel Core i7-9750H Processor 12MB Cache, up to 4.50GHz."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1285,Decided to go for the 1650 to future proof it alittle because i dont change my laptop for about 3 to 4 years at least.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1285,Last but not least.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1285,Thanks Intel888 for the info on getting the good deal.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1286,How much cost for this setup?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1287,check your inbox
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1287,i pmed
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1287,Nice!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1287,Initally i wanted to get your setup
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1287,but then again i don't think i will need better specs for my com if i'm using mostly for school work.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1287,How much did you spend?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1287,Got use shopback or not
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1288,My set up cost $1590.88 before discount.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1288,"After discount, the actual price is really lower"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1288,and it’s really worth it to get it.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1288,I still remember my old Asus ROG gaming laptop cost $2699 four years ago!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1289,I read up 1650
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1289,was the newer version of the 1050.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1289,But I know nothing much about PC nowadays.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1289,I’m using it for work and secretly playing some games during work.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1289,LOL
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1289,Yes I did used the shopback!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1289,Not sure when they will credit in.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1289,Edit :
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1289,"I just calculated my actual cost and discount price between the two graphic card, it is only $111 different!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1289,😯
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1290,"Yea the new graphic card is slightly better in terms of performance of games, and holds 1gb more."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1290,Haha
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1290,"you have the same mindset as me, work mainly and game while have the chance."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1290,"Damn, maybe i should have pulled the trigger for 1650 graphic card."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1290,oh well.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1291,Who knows the thermal throttling could limit this new card.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1291,Just like how my old Asus laptop’s gfx cars kaput twice after playing apex legend for 1 hour.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1292,Was looking at which L340 option to buy.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1292,"The graphic card between the customize and gaming option seems a bit different, like 1GB different, not sure got other diff anot."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1292,customize - NVIDIA GeForce GTX1050
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1292,3GB GDDR5 96bit.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1292,gaming - NVIDIA GeForce GTX1050 4GB GDDR5
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1292,Any idea what is the different between the 2 S$1199 option?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1292,So far what I can see is
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1292,the SSD different 256GB vs 128GB.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1293,"When your laptop arrive, can share how it works when you play legend?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1293,My current 7 yr old Lenovo cannot handle legend even if nothing else is running.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1293,The whole keyboard gets super hot.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1293,"But then, this grand dame also cannot handle multiple files Internet tabs, Pdfs, Word, etc."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1293,without heating up
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1293,"I scared the new L340 also will heat up, so I get"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1293,GTX1050 3GB to play safe.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1293,But then the L340 has a whole row of vents at the bottom.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1293,Could help ventilate.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1294,My shopback successful email came a few hours after I placed the order.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1294,Maybe you can file claim with shopback if you don't see it soon.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1295,Sure will do!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1295,"I don’t expect high setting, but at least Low to Med comfortably."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1295,"As far as I know, my old laptop uses one from mobo and one dedicated gfx card."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1295,"When performing light work, it’s very seamless, but when gaming on dedicated gfx card, the whole laptop is like a rocket."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1295,Loud fan blowing.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1295,It’s gona be very interesting for this laptop given at this price point.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1295,Comparing all other brands at least $2k above.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1295,Did receive the shopback notification but still pending.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1295,Btw your order shipment out already?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1296,I suppose won't kaput so fast
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1296,la.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1296,"After all they define it as gaming laptop, i'm sure it will work it out if you put low / mid settings."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1296,"I talked to the agent about this, but got brushed it off saying the pre-configured comes in that way."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1296,"Either way if you like the pre-configured version, feel free to get that one."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1296,"and your 2nd point,"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1296,yeah seems like it's only the SSD.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1296,But i think you best ask the agent about it.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1296,Yeah i got the email from shopback
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1296,saying it's tracked with the amount too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1296,My order shipment for those 10c $1 is otw while the laptop isn't.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1297,"Yeah, think i am also going with everything max out except the graphics card, leaving it at 1050 just to be safe."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1297,Gonna be used primarily for video editing.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1297,@whatme and @intel888 should do the same benchmark to see if it will thermal throttle since the other specs are the same haha!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1298,I'll try to see if will thermal throttle when I get my machine.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1298,"@whatme and @petshijie, just checked the tracking, my shipment label for accessories just created on UPS."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1298,Send to Sg from Hongkong!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1298,I thought it is from Sg warehouse.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1299,How about the laptop?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1299,Is it still not yet shipped out?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1299,"For my order, the mouse created shipping label, despite yesterday ordered only."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1299,kind of weird to see all ship individually
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1300,Just completed my order with the same specs as @Intel888.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1300,Looking forward!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1300,Shopback recorded the transaction too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1300,Hope shipping and everything
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1300,will go smoothly hehe
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1301,May I know the price after discount?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1302,All my accessories except for 1 mouse mat has shipped out.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1302,Laptop is still processing.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1302,Yeah i realise all of them ship individually and probably gonna receive them 1 by 1...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1302,Doesn't matter to me as long they come.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1302,My guess is that this laptop deal is too good that alot of people order it from here and elsewhere
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1302,Now we just have to wait.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1302,Have to thank TS for opening a thread for this laptop
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1302,haha.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1303,"After the discount is $1352, haven’t deduct shopback rebate too."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1303,Perhaps if successful rebate to my account.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1303,It will be $1230 .
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1303,"At this price, where to get?!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1304,You mean people ordering from other places instead?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1305,"Now the 15% discount is available to everyone, dont have to chat with the operator le, there's a chance to get 15% off using the spin wheel popup."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1305,😬
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1306,I dont think anywhere else is selling it tho..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1306,Called up lenovo bugis to ask if there's any display unit to try out
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1306,but the rep said it's not available in any physicsl stores in sg.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1307,"I meant like in other countries, since their laptop is built elsewhere before they ship to singapore"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1307,so everyone is buying just like us here.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1307,Just my guess :p
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1307,Nice!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1307,Spam the wheel till you get 15% discount!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1307,Yeah think it's too new already.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1307,Eager to wait for mine to arrive.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1307,The feeling is like you're one of the first few people to get the laptop before market release haha
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1308,"The spinning wheel only entitled once, would have cut time to speak to the chat agent though.."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1308,I don’t know why I got a strong feeling Lenovo actually marks up a lot too
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1309,"Cheapest in Singapore, JB and some say Batam"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1310,"Now we have four of us owning this laptop soon, we will able to provide some reviews for others who is considering a Low Budget gaming laptop 😛"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1311,"I've called up a few places too so that I could see the machine myself, but they don't have it yet."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1311,"The Best Denki guy called some supposedly Lenovo rep when I was at the store, and told me that the physical laptop will arrive in the store in around 2 weeks."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1311,"If you are familiar with Ideapad, should be ok to order this without 'feeling it'."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1311,Keyboard feel should be similar.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1311,"I could be wrong, but to me Thinkpad keyboard feels a tad different."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1311,"Yeah, nice to know that we are getting our hands on this before mass release"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1312,So weird that I received a sms notification that someone gona deliver on Friday.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1312,"“Dear Customer,
I'm on behalf of Lenovo arranging delivery of your Lenovo Ideapad on Friday 31"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1312,may between 9AM to 5PM.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1312,Please reply to confirm delivery by 4.30pm.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1312,Thank you”
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1312,I think it is the accessories only 🤣

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1314,I have a question.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1314,For those who get the customised version.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1314,I realise that the model is l340 instead of l340 gaming.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1314,So if we select the keyboard back-lit.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1314,Is it blue color as portray in the l340 gaming?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1314,Generally is l340 custom outlook the same as they portray the l340?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1314,I do note that there are normal l340 ideapad which is not the gaming edition...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1314,That's my worry

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1315,On a side note.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1315,"How the coupon work is, u have to confirm your cart then supply them with your email and name, they will generate the code for you, but it is valid only for 5-7 mins and is one time only."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1315,So gotta firm up your mind first before asking for codes from operator.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1316,"There’s the standard version of L340 at another Lenovo catalogue, which it has different colour variants."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1316,"However for gaming, customised one will look the same as the gaming version?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1317,A bit different for me.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1317,The CSO gave me code via Live Chat when I was ready to order.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1318,I hope the customised one will look the same as the gaming version.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1318,CSO told me it's the same.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1318,Hopefully it's true.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1318,"I prefer the gaming version - Blue logo on lid, and blue backlit keyboard."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1318,Nice!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1319,Yes I like that too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1319,I'm just afraid the customise one may look different since they got non keyboard back light option...

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1320,"Hi,
I am interest in purchasing this as well."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1320,May I know from those who have purchased this laptop whether does the Lenovo store online accept installments.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1320,"Additionally, may I also know the actual battery life of the laptop as well?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1320,Thank you
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1321,Would be disappointing if it came out silver as the standard version.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1321,LOL.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1321,But I think the gaming version has a better and larger cooling vent right?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1321,My items all shipped out except the laptop too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1322,Just received the laptop sling bag and legion backpack.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1322,That’s so crazy.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1322,Why wouldn’t they ship all at once haha
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1323,"trying to customize it, but cant seem to find the option for 16gb ram and 512gb ssd?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1323,anyone can advise?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1324,I think the 16gb ram option was available for i7 configuration.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1324,"I just noticed my order page, the laptop expected to ship was changed to earlier date."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1324,Anyone had that too?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1325,"Not right, My order configuration is i5, 16 GB, 512 Pcie NVME, GTX1650."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1325,Canceled Ram 4GB onboard then
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1325,16 GB option  will available.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1326,"ok, problem solved."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1326,"Once I selected the i7 upgrade, the options became available."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1326,After that just need to scroll back up to switch back to the i5 chip and viola!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1327,Ok guys!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1327,Those who order around the same time as me 28 May should see their laptop shipped out liao.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1330,then I can try out.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1330,"Parts made in china, nothing surprising"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1330,"Anyway whichever users that are keen in purchasing this laptop, get it soon!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1330,The sales will be over by sunday 11:59pm.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1330,"And i realise, lenovo giving away tablet when spend above 2k in single receipt!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1330,Though doesn't really apply to everyone who buys here because will be less than 2k
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1330,but if buying 2 laptops or people don't mind sharing
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1330,can consider it!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1331,Ordered mine on 25th
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1331,May -
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1331,"with the same configuration as yours except for warranty upgrade which I am not sure if you did, and if it may affect order-to-delivery time."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1331,"Contacted CS on 28th for update, and was replied with no update from plant, BUT promised an ""update within the day""."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1331,"Until today still no update, and expected to ship date delayed to 3rd June."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1331,"Upon a check online, I see a handful of posts with delayed Lenovo order, some for months."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1331,Hoping that this is not the case with mine.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1331,"Anyway, I sent another email on 31st May to pester them for clarification haha."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1331,Will update here if there is any problem or nothing serious.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1332,"Wow sounds bad, I do heard about very late shipment for Lenovo laptop such as the E495 ThinkPad."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1332,"But I did not extend my warranty,"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1332,I’m wondering why would they delay your shipment for a extend warranty?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1332,Is it because they will build a more “durable” part inside?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1332,So it will last thru your warranty period?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1332,Lol..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1332,Perhaps it’s just some logistic problem which it doesn’t flow when warranty is extended.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1333,Looks like it's no big deal after all.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1333,Received shipment notification yesterday afternoon.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1334,I was browsing Facebook and saw the Aftershock promotion.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1334,"With their Forge 15, their basic spec looks very similar with this Lenovo gaming laptop."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1334,Price point also around $1385 for the gtx1050
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1334,while $1485 for the gtx1650
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1334,"What I customised in Lenovo, cost $1550 without 15% discount."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1334,"If we compare on price, the Lenovo laptop I customised of $1350 less 15% will beat the $1385 aftershock in terms of the graphic card?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1334,Any others?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1335,Aftershock design seemed nicer especially if u are into rgb keyboard.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1335,"The forge got 15 color to choose, although it's only 1 layer."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1335,And I think cooling elements in forge is better in my opinion.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1335,"Other than that, probably sama sama."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1335,I'm seriously looking for the apex lite due to its rgb keybaod and 1.89kg light weight..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1335,Only.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1335,I can relate to this.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1335,I have been struggling between aftershock and levenovo laptop for past 2 weeks.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1335,Today is the last day of the promotion.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1335,I still can't make up my mind.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1335,"It seemed I am baring more to aftershock at the moment not deal to specs, but deal to I like their design better..."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1335,Hmmm

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1336,"Shyt, I realise today is last day of sale."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1336,How to ask for 15% discount code sia??
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1336,Gg liao...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1336,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1337,Now the answer is pretty straight that you should get the aftershock instead
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1337,😂
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1337,Perhaps you should visit the fair now to try it out.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1338,"Don't worry, go to lenovo home page."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1338,There will be a popup for their spin the wheel
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1338,and you can get 15% discount.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1338,You have to fill up your email first then can spin the wheel.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1338,Can easily get 15% discount if you know the trick :p
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1338,Let me pm you on that
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1338,Edit
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1338,": Side note, my estimated delivery for laptop is on 6th june."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1338,The parcel got from Hefei -
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1338,>
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1338,Shanghai -> korea.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1338,I wonder why have to go through so many transit...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1339,"But the waiting time for apex 15 lite is 6-8 weeks, according to the people at the fair"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1340,I got it!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1340,Thanks.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1341,if I could pm you.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1341,"Apparently, I need to post 10 posts."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1341,"I'm new to this place, sorry"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1342,Wow that’s a long wait!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1342,"Yes, I think our laptop is in the same shipment."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1342,It went Korea :/
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1343,"Btw those who got the lenovo laptop, anyone could verify if the 9% shopback rebates worked?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1343,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1344,Shopback managed to tracked but they will only release the funds when Lenovo has acknowledged we receive the laptop and has not return back to them.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1345,So you mean shopback already recognised the 9% rebate for your entire purchase?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1345,I understand it take 2 to 3 months for the rebates to be in.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1345,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1346,"Yes, it was tracked after 30min of my purchase."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1347,Cool.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1347,I've decide to get the l340 over the aftershock after all.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1347,Cheers!

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1348,Yay 😀
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1348,Finally!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1348,But what makes you suddenly decide?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1348,I couldn’t find out how does the L340 cool down this system tho .
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1349,I found out about the ventilation for this laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1349,"Apparently one is on the center of the hinge of laptop there, and there's one big long ventilation right at the bottom of the laptop."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1349,"Taking into this consideration, i suggest to get a cooling pad for this laptop especially for long hours gaming."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1349,"And also after shutting down the laptop, try not to close the laptop lid immediately to let some air out from the ventialation at the hinge there."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1349,I will try and see how it works when i get the laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1349,"And yeah, shopback 9% cashback is real."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1349,first time getting like $100 for my cashback worth lol although it's now tracked and not release yet.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1349,And my CC rebate makes this buy worth.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1349,Deals ends today so better get it!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1350,Lol Guess what!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1350,"The shipment went USA now, I wonder how many times it will transfer before reaching SG"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1351,Becuase practicalness overcomes my desire for design /outlooks
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1351,lol.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1351,Exactly same specs.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1351,$1250 vs $1550.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1351,Save $300 makes more sense to me

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1354,This acer is radeon tech.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1354,So abit hard to compare.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1354,"For me, I still prefer Intel."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1354,"And those acer nitro from shopback and Qoo10 lazada etc, are older ver laptop."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1354,Cheap probably due to clearance.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1354,I almost want to get a acer nitro 5 from q10 for $917 after cart discount.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1354,Really  very attractive.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1354,What pulled me away is it doesnt come with ssd which is a deal breaker for me.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1356,Mine probably same shipment as yours.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1356,"Tracking showed that laptop went from Hefei China, to Shanghai China, to Incheon Korea, then Anchorage United States."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1356,Now just left Anchorage to don't know where.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1356,World tour
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1357,"Yes, on Youtuber mentioned about the vents too."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1357,Do you have recommendation for cooling pad?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1357,Important to get the design that does not push back the hot air into the vents.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1358,Thanks.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1358,Figured it out.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1358,Damn.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1358,Some free items Oct 19 den ship out...

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1359,It went to Louisville Kentucky to eat KFC Liao.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1359,Why so far
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1360,That's probably the mouse mat.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1360,Don't worry about it.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1360,They'll ship it to you when they have stock.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1360,"My mouse mat was expected to ship around Oct as well, arrived on 30th May."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1361,Mine is still at korea...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1361,Estimated delivery on the 6/6.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1361,maybe need go world tour
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1361,then receive it on the estimated date itself.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1361,"You're right, since the air vent is below then best not to get cooling pad to prevent hot air pushing back."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1361,in that case i probably look up on laptop stand instead since i'm moving around often.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1361,"I think can consider this cooling fan, it seems good but look bulky."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1362,Same scheduled delivery date 6/6 as me except mine went to USA.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1362,I guess this is their first shipment out to worldwide on this product.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1362,Probably we are not looking for those cooling pad that are blowing air upwards right?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1362,I think a laptop stand will be good though?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1363,Hmm I'm not in an urgent need but just hope they wouldn't delay till next week
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1363,that's all.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1363,"Yup, the earlier link that i posted about laptop cooler fan is similar to this video i found online."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1366,Erm i'm not exactly sure if the laptop bottom pulls air in or push air out.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1366,Can only find out when the laptop arrive

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1368,Arrival scan.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1368,No sign that it will depart from Shanghai yet.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1368,"The one in Kentucky is supposedly the UPS World Port, ""the center point of UPS's worldwide air network"", also their largest hub, so I think your package is good, though it is halfway across the world."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1369,But did they give you a scheduled delivery date?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1369,Perhaps mine is the last country to clear liao

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1374,Last tracked now is at clearance agency.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1374,Should be either at SG custom or waiting to clear at USA..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1374,How about you guys?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1375,Same here.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1375,My guess is Singapore since my last tracked is korea...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1375,can't be we both clearance at different country at the same timing.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1376,Lol !!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1376,It went korea!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1376,I Guess it will ship together with yours
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1377,I think mine is same with your shipment.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1377,It's back to Korea for kimchi after having chicken in US.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1377,Now departed Korea for don't know where
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1378,Do you think it will send to US to assemble some stuff into the laptop and then send back to SG?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1378,Or else I find it
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1378,no reason to go back US and Korea
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1379,2019聯想電腦美國組裝？可以買咧!!!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1380,"Once they sent it to UPS, they set the delivery location to your address, so it won't stop by Lenovo plant anymore."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1380,Wherever it goes in that time frame between shipped to delivered is up to UPS.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1380,"UPS Expedited has a longer time in-between, compared to Express, and it's up to UPS to use that time to lower the cost as much as possible."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1380,"I think your package along with other packages going to non-US with a longer delivery time is put together in the same cargo plane as other package going for US, and then return back to Korea, just to clear up some space in UPS warehouse."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1380,"They can sell those warehouse spaces, from which they will probably earn more compared to the money they lost by loading up the empty spaces in the plane."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1381,So my parcel went from korea to shenzhen and now it's at changi!

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1387,I checked the Lenovo order status page.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1387,It changed the expected to arrive date from 6 June to 4 June which it’s today.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1387,Hope you guys will receive today too!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1388,No problem!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1388,Hoping to have positive feedback on the laptop then let's see if we have different opinion
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1388,看了你两个选择后，你选IdeaPad L340-17IRH比较适合你玩PubG吃雞。主要是因为GPU在IdeaPad L340-17IRH是适合玩游戏的。Lenovo-IdeaPad-L340-17IWL它是用Integrated Graphics，就是你的Processor
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1388,"GPU，不能玩游戏像是PubG,"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1388,Dota。
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1388,你要买在Lenovo湾站的话，记得开Shopback拿。现在有７％Cashback。然后拿１５％折扣。但是这个你要和Lenovo代理人说你兴趣。这个你要找一位会英文来帮你吧！
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1389,I agree with Geeky010.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1389,Think our laptops were part of a larger shipment.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1389,"Anyway, just saw that it's went back to Korea, then backtracked to Shenzhen."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1389,"Finally, it has landed in SG this morning."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1390,Mine is still stated 6 June.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1390,Hmm ...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1391,Saw it depart Changi
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1391,"but no movement already, see how again."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1391,Pretty exciting
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1392,Wows it really is pretty exciting!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1392,Did you receive any sms abt the delivery like when they are delivering the accessories?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1393,Did anyone order the mouse mat and got any updates on its status?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1393,Mine is expected to ship on 16 Oct..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1394,"Yeah, mine was expected to ship around Oct as well."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1394,The mat will be delivered once they have stock.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1394,"Mine is shipped on 28th May, 3 days after ordering it."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1395,Great!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1395,Would suck to have to wait that long just to receive a mouse mat
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1396,No notification for UPS but some items such as the backpack are delivered by Tiong Nam which they will me.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1396,I received all accessories even the mouse mat already.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1396,Still no news from UPS for the laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1396,Low chance lo
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1397,Hopefully UPS still deliver at night if not need to wait till thurs liao.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1397,Mine's expected to reach on 12june :/
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1398,"I just ordered mine last night, minimum 2 weeks wait for me"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1398,but cant
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1398,wait to see your reviews man!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1399,"Yup guys, not here for today."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1399,Probably Thursday delivering.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1399,Have to put the excitement aside.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1399,The mouse mat is really nice.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1400,HAHA mouse mat
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1400,😂
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1400,Glad
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1400,i went with the mouse mat too
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1401,Yeah they're delivering on thursday...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1401,"I received all accessories as well too, so it's just the laptop"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1401,i'm eager to get it now
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1402,So far there isn’t anyone online who received their laptop right?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1402,Even USA or China?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1402,Like no reviews on YouTube too..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1403,My shipment shows that there is a 'Departure Scan' from SG this afternoon.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1403,Hopefully my laptop is not going around the world again
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1403,There's a very brief review here.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1403,Posted this sometime ago
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1404,"Same here, I was very excited when I saw departure scan because my mouse mat was shipped by UPS."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1404,"Once they depart Changi, it will change to “Singapore,Singapore Arrival Scan” which three hours later I received the mat, too bad it didn’t."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1404,Well enjoy tomorrow public holiday first!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1405,"My laptop finally arrived at Changi this morning, though the delivery date is now pushed back to 8/6 instead."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1406,Let’s look forward tomorrow!!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1407,This is getting exciting.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1407,Some of my accessories are also being starting to ship out lol.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1408,Everyone is like so excited in this thread post.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1408,If it's tomorrow arriving i probably be able to test at night after my work.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1408,I'll give a short review probably before midnight.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1408,"Meanwhile, whoever received it can give reviews as well."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1408,Hope to contribute
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1409,"Same here, only can track it and feel happy when the laptop deliver to our home but can touch it after work."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1409,Actually what we need to do first when we receive the laptop ah?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1409,I remember someone order before
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1409,and he said the battery need conditioning or something
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1410,I think one of our bros here have received quite long ago.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1410,Wonder how is it now
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,Oops....
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,Ok so I am not an expert in this area.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,Moreover its my first gaming laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,The good in short:
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,=- the build of the laptop is good.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,"- The blue keyboard back light is nice and I am glad we have 3 options to turn it off, dim it and make it bright."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,=- My son used it to play fortnite and he is happy with it citing that he can play using the highest graphics etc
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,BUT the power mode has to be turned on to performance mode first else it will lag apparently.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,The bad:
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,"=- the Battery life seems weak so whenever I am NOT plugged in, I will use the Safe Mode to make the best out of the Battery life"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,"- I emailed Lenovo several times asking them abt the ""Quiet"" and ""Quick"" mode because based on the website, it said its good for gaming and can be done by a simple ""flick""."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,Apparently alot of them cant really explain to me
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,whats that.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,Almost all eventually told me its basically to configure the BIOS by adjusting the fan something like that.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,Read:
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,=- I bet you have read this on some review.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,"All the ports USB, USB-C, power etc are all on the non-traditional LEFT side of the laptop."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,So its abit weird or inconvenient.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,"Anymore questions you all have, let me know lor."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1411,Thks.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1412,Yeah usually it will be below 50% battery when you first receive it.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1412,What i tend to do is to drain the battery finish even when i get my new phone then leave to charge it overnight
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1412,6-8hours.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1412,I believe that is part of battery conditioning right?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1412,"I'll probably test around by doing both normal work and gaming, then i give both results to see how well is the laptop in terms of noise by the fan vents, keyboard feel etc."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1413,Thank you bro for the insightful review.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1413,Totally appreciate it too!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1413,I’m kind of disturbed by
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1413,where is the work and quick mode that you are facing.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1413,Maybe because my main reason of getting this laptop is able to switch around.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1413,Or they didn’t develop the software yet.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1414,One of my reasons was also becauze
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1414,I thought I can switch around however all the customer services guys could only point me to the Bios configuration.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1414,One of them was even worst.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1414,"He told me its the button which is actually the switch to close/block the camera  because if you look at the Lenovo website, the pic beside this feature is actually  the camera pic."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1414,He
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1414,Totally does not know his product at all.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1415,I went to further research and found one of the review mentioned that Lenovo is still mysteriously brief about this mode but not yet confirm.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1415,Maybe gotta wait lo..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1415,"anyway I think if we use power saving mode, high chance the laptop using onboard graphic card than the own graphic card."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1415,Same as my current Asus laptop
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1416,"@extremme so far based on your usage, how long does the battery last?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1416,>
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1416,1hr?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1417,"It's weird that they put this function as one of the features, but it hasn't been developed yet?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1417,Does the manual book says anything?

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1418,That's why I titled this thread for work and light gaming
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1418,@Extremme:
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1418,Thanks for the review.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1418,How long does the battery last when not gaming?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1419,Looks like we can’t secretly game while working until they come out with it!!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1419,Lol
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1419,Once we all get our hands with the laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1419,We shall send bunch of emails to the ask them again too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1420,Not even on gaming.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1420,"I was only listening to spotify, normal surfing.."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1420,my estimate is <3hrs on normal mode.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1420,My son was playing Fortnite yesterday and he commented the laptop is getting hot.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1420,So I think I need to get a proper fan system like what some commented in the last few posts.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1421,Yes we shd.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1421,I think we shd be asking the other regions' CSO too because the model was released much earlier in the US or UK
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1421,I think so I am surprised there is not much discussion or complains on the net for those regions.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1422,Less than 3 hours is really quite little.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1422,They should have doubled the battery capacity to 90wh and idm paying slightly more for it
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1422,tho..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1422,Wats ur screen's brightness level?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1422,Is your cpu
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1422,the i7-9750H?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1422,"Maybe can try to undervolt the cpu to allow it to run cooler and consume less battery, at least thats what I am going to try doing when I get mine"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1423,3hrs on normal mode is really little.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1423,I was expecting somewhere 5-6 hrs on normal usage...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1423,Is this on safe mode or performance mode?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1423,Perhaps you have many programs running that makes it <3hrs?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1423,I probably test out the battery over the weekend.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1423,"As for the laptop cooler, here's the link again."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1423,I might buy one if the laptop really gets hot on normal usage.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1424,Shipment still on transit.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1424,Morning
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1424,no movement at all..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1425,"Yes my CPU is i7-9750H, display is GTX1060."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1425,I am on safe mode..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1426,Not really actually.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1426,"for now, I merely use it for normal surfing, desktop chats, and listening to music."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1426,The heat is generated when my son is playing game.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1426,"For normal use, its really quiet and cool."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1427,1060?how did you manage to get the option?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1427,I could only select either 1050 3gb or 1650 4gb though.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1440,What are your exact specs?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1441,Can't wait to try out mine tonight.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1441,How's the fan vent?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1441,"Does the vent come out from the bottom, then the hinge is the air intake or exhaust?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1441,Sorry
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1441,i not good with the terms
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1441,haha.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1441,You only have SSD hard drive of 256gb?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1441,you probably need HDD.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1441,Anyway now they have $1 for 3 years upgrade.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1441,Remember to get shopback 7% cashback and apply 15% discount coupon from their spin wheel via their main website.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1442,Exactly like mine right?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1442,Most probably gona use a fan to blow it temporarily if it’s gona be so hot.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1442,"See how again, tonight will try it"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1443,"Sorry bro, I’m also working now, can’t wait to get home to try Apex Legends hahaha"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1444,Oh.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1444,"Sorry, I got ssd 512gb, no hdd."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1444,"Well, I bought last week during pcshow."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1444,So I didn't got the 3 year upgrade.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1444,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1445,I should have gotten the 3 years warranty too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1445,Don’t know how reliable is Lenovo
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1446,Haha
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1446,no one expected after 2nd june that lenovo will have this promo.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1446,But it seems like you have to spin the wheel to get the 10c upgrade 3 years warranty.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1446,"I checked the 10c upgrade to 3 years when configuring the warranty setting, seems like you really have to get the code."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1446,Most likely the 10c upgrade 3 years will come in a code to insert when you check out.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1446,So will it overwrite the 15% discount?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1446,Not sure
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1446,but people who are getting it can try spinning the wheel.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1447,"Display : 17.3"" FHD 1920x1080, LED Backlight, IPS, 300nits, Anti-glare."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1447,GOOD PRICE?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1448,Unlikely the promo code will not stack with the 15% discount as I tried entering the $5 off too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1448,How Long is the standard warranty ah?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1449,One year only.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1449,Which is very short.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1450,"After the 15% discount, you won't find any brand with similar spec for that price checked CEE and IT Show, ended up buying from"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1450,Lenovo Online lol.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1450,"So yes, it's a good price."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1451,Looks like my laptop won't arrive today.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1451,"The ground delivery is scheduled for this Saturday, eventhough the hub is like 2km away from my place."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1451,Checking with UPS CS if I can just collect on my own instead.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1451,"If not, grounded at home whole Saturday also not a solution."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1451,Looking forward to your reviews.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1452,"Haven't received mine yet, even though the tracking showed that the scheduled delivery is today."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1452,Hmm ...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1453,So far my current Lenovo Ideapad has lasted me 7 years until it started acting funny.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1453,Still can do stuff
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1453,"but sometimes Internet access disappears, re-enable network adapter will hang."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1453,"When it utter mad mood, then will not boot up"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1453,"The grand dame not designed for gaming, so will heat up when gaming."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1453,"IMO, still can use for unimportant things like surfing the net."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1453,"For work, better not."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1453,My workplace Lenovo Thinkpad never give problems.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1453,Just can't stand the red knob my personal preference.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1453,"So far, in my experience, Lenovo has outlasted in terms of years before act funny Sony, Fujitsu, Toshiba 2 models."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1454,Nice!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1454,I'm also looking forward!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1454,Please share reviews when ready
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1455,Wow I have received all my accessories.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1456,Those who will be receiving the laptop soon might also check the seal is it half pry open anot.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1456,So weird
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1457,Yeah same thing.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1457,Went down to PC show to get a laptop but ended up buying from lenovo online instead after checking the prices.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1457,Quite surprising as you would think pc show will be cheaper for the specs plus some stock clearing
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1457,but here we have a brand new self-customised model being cheaper.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1458,Yeah I'm glad to find this thread before heading down to the CEE show as I was looking around for a recommendation for laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1458,"Until i saw shopback available and initially found $100 then became 15% discount, became too hard to resist and i ended up getting it."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1458,Saved my time to go CEE and IT show.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1458,"My UPS delivery guy came today, but unfortunately nobody at home."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1458,"So probably tomorrow will get it, but i wont be home till late."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1458,I leave the review to saturday then
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1459,"For my case, I went from pc show to check out aftershock laptops."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1459,Seemed like they only give better promos if you getting the top range slate or above models.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1459,Tried to get an upgrade of apex lite to 16 gb.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1459,But still need a top up.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1459,I don't think can get discount so easily liao.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1459,So in the end chose to buy lenovo online liao lor.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1459,Overall cheaper somemore.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1460,I like the IPS panel
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1460,haha!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1460,Cant really test it today because of alot of things to set up tonight.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1460,Looks like the software are being updated before its shipped out.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1460,Maybe the Lenovo team open this laptop to install some important software before handing over.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1460,But the keyboard layout is weird.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1460,"Everything to the left, to the left."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1460,LOL
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1461,My machine arrived just before 10pm - UPS guys sure are working late.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1461,Just got it set up -  Very fast and seamless.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1461,So far it is quiet.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1461,"Heats up a bit when I try out Legend via Bluestacks, but gaming was smooth."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1461,No lag.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1461,Graphics ok
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1461,but I think my tablet is a bit sharper.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1461,To me there is a slight yellow tint compared to my tablet.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1461,Battery 50% drained out after around 45 minutes set up and 5 min gaming
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1461,"It is idle now ready to use and charging, and the keyboard feels a bit warm."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1461,Don't feel the air coming out of the vents below.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1461,Anyone knows if there is a way to optimise the fan?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1462,I felt the exhaust is blowing towards the monitor leh
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1462,Kind of noisy if you put it at performance mode.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1462,I’m trying to figure the work mode now
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1462,lol
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1463,Yes.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1463,According to YouTube review.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1463,Exhaust is on the blue panel ontop of the keyboard.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1463,It is blowing towards the screen.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1463,Which is somewhat worrying

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1464,"After playing graphic intensive Apex Legends, can feel the heat coming from the vent at the hinge."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1464,The bottom ventilation is definitely the intake already.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1464,"Either you have a ceiling fan in your room to dissipate the heat, or else have a table fan to blow the heat off."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1464,Should be ok.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1464,Monitor in front doesn't feel hot.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1464,Battery going fast...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1465,what settings could you play it on?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1465,what specs was the specs you got?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1465,"also, what is the battery life for just basic internet browsing?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1465,"thanks man, for helping us review this"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1466,"I merely tried it on the Medium setting first, reasonable warm but framerate wouldnt that bad."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1466,I think can handle high with some items off.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1466,Battery life shown on the laptop is 4 hours only.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1466,Perhaps we have to continue using it for a long time so that they can predict our usage longer.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1466,You can refer back to first few pages we shared among our specs.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1466,I chosen the  highest i7 processor and gtx configuration.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1466,"As i typing this review, the laptop on power saving mode is really quiet and seamless like what Intel888 has mentioned."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1467,lol 4 hours only.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1467,"on the lenovo website, they said 9 hours."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1467,probably dimmed the display to the lowest setting and used airplane mode
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1468,"See how again, its like the predicted hours of usage keep on changing."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1468,Im using the second lowest brightness
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1468,and I find it comfortable already.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1468,Im browsing the lenovo software support page to look for the work and quick mode.. nah..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1468,no chance.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1468,Where is the flick!!!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1468,lol
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1469,"Yeah, I couldn't find the said flick too."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1469,Add on to my review:
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1469,The sound system is ok.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1469,Played some music.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1469,Didn't see the equalizer for the default music and video player.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1469,Guess have to download a player that has an equalizer.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1469,Regarding the noise.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1469,I don't know why
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1469,but I can hear it now and then.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1469,I think it is the fan.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1469,Think the fan only runs when the heat goes above a certain threshold.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1469,"After some time, the fan auto switched off, and no sound at all."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1470,Haha I have been searching for the flick for freaking almost a month.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1470,Gave up haha
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1471,"Oh if the bottom vent is the intake, then the previous laptop cooler link i gave should help."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1471,In fact i think any laptop cooler should work.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1471,Thanks for your quick review!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1472,May I know what are the implications that if a laptop overheats?

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1473,Perhaps it was my bad
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1473,cos
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1473,I didn’t provide good cooling environment too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1473,But sounds like
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1473,the laptop cooler is definitely useful now.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1473,Going to bring it to workplace today and see how far I can stretch the battery
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1474,"the one you recommended, is it big huh?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1474,dont think I will use it but more for my son lor...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1475,I not sure as i don't have it.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1475,But judging from the youtube video.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1475,", i think the size is like those 1 litre milk carton."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1475,If your son doesn't bring out the laptop you can consider getting 1.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1476,Can try to undervolt the cpu so that it will produce lesser heat and use less power but at the same time have maintain the same performance if not more!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1476,"There are lots of tutorials online showing how to undervolt the i7-9750H, won't be too difficult."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1476,I think its a great first step before getting the laptop cooler
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1477,"Instead of under volting it, can we just game it with a lower performance mode?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1477,Looks like there are like four variations.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1477,From Best Battery / Better Battery - Balance - Better Performance / Performance mode.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1477,I can’t rmb is it right
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1477,anot.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1477,The Lenovo vantage app is it useful anot
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1477,ah?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1477,Got many bloatwares
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1477,"sia, got candy crush inside also..."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1478,I find it pretty useful at least to me.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1478,It help tracks all the system updates etc.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1479,"I feel the more we need Lenovo to tell us about the ""Flick"" about Quiet and Quick mode."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1480,"Can also, just that the experience might not be that great as compared to best performance plus undervolting 😝"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1481,"Yeah, not sure what does their Quiet or quick mode do to the system."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1481,Might be something that's really useful or just 2 different modes where the fans spin at a different speed LOL.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1481,Got a feeling
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1481,"the ""each mode looks, feels and acts differently"" is just for advertising purposes"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1481,tho ofc
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1481,i hope not too :/
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1482,Does anyone still have the 3 years warranty promotion code?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1482,Trying my luck to enter it now via vantage app.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1483,the promo code can be used after purchase?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1483,I thought have to buy the warranty when making purchase hahaha

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1489,i received all the accessories except for the mouse.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1489,is it weird that the laptop is still not shipped out yet?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1490,So does the 3 year warranty can apply together  with 15%?

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1491,It’s normal.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1491,I received the bags after two days has past from the order date.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1491,Lol!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1491,Laptop take some time if it’s customised

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1493,These fans seems good too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1494,Laptop surprisingly arrived yesterday around 10PM.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1494,"Temperature looks quite good, even though the keyboard gets hot."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1494,I tried running Anthem on high settings for an hour.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1494,"GPU temp 45C at idle stayed around 70C most of the time, and maxed out at 74C. Hard drive temp is barely affected within 5C difference from idle"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1494,and it fluctuates.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1494,"Not sure about CPU temp though, since the app doesn't detect the sensor for CPU, but I'll try it again later."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1494,"For those who wants to customise, but unsure if it is worth the $20 to upgrade to black keyboard with backlight, this is how the default grey keyboard no backlight looks."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1495,The black keyboard means no back lit right?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1495,"At first, i felt it wasnt worth it until i saw the actual keyboard."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1495,The blue contrast really pops out and without light felt bright too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1496,you mean its too bright?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1497,I think can dim the lights too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1497,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1498,yup you can.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1498,3 modes.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1498,Fn + Spacebar
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1499,Yup i mean i like the keyboard brightness.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1499,The medium brightness is superb good already.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1499,I still dont bear to game with this laptop for a hour.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1499,"I think need to warm up alittle, yesterday was smelling some hot plastic."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1500,"anyone know the difference between i7-9750h and the i5-9300h, apart from performance?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1500,would the i5 use less power and run at lower temperatures compared to i7?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1501,Just ordered World War Z game to test out this laptop!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1501,"Last time i use to game on my old ps4, which all the games are so costly!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1501,This laptop is awesome
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1501,"I played Apex legends on High, GTX 1650 is really nice!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1502,nice!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1502,but was it damn hot tho?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1503,All look good to me!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1503,I'm thinking the one the requires the least energy to function likely better - less demands on the already heating up laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1503,What do you guys think?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1504,I second that!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1504,Totally like the blue backlit keyboard.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1504,If anyone considering the regular one vs. the blue backlit.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1504,Get the latter.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1504,It's awesome IMO!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1504,Also helps if you working in dim light conditions.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1505,I dont think its very hot.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1505,Reasonably warm temperature.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1505,Noisy is one thing but not as whiny as my old asus rog too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1506,Even a laptop stand would definitely help the air circulation below better.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1506,Looks like the base of the laptop does not really have ample of space for the tilt .
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1507,"So I received my laptop earlier in the afternoon yesterday after reattempt delivery, and I just got back home at this timing."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1507,Wanted to sleep straight but decided to do a short unboxing experience here.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1507,"When I first saw it, i immediately look at the seal which earlier on bro told me the seal wasn't placed properly."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1507,So this is how the delivery box and the seal part look like.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1507,Guess lenovo did something to it?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1507,Pasted white box for personal privacy reason
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1507,These are the parts that came in the box.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1507,right
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1507,how the bottom of the laptop looked like privacy reason for the white box again
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1507,Finishing of the top lid looks good.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1507,I like the smooth feeling.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1507,Opening the lid will have this thin protective sleeve for the screen.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1507,"And, the final look."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1507,"As it is rather late now, i'll probably do my test when i wake up and give a short review of what i feel, maybe at night."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1508,thinking of buying total war:3 Kingdom.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1508,The graphics is solid but not sure if this laptop can handle
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1509,Wah seh.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1512,"Most of us, had travelled around the world before coming to Singapore."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1512,Travelled more than my lifetime.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1512,Anyway playing world war z on this laptop is zippy smooth on medium.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1512,High might be jittery.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1512,"It’s on sales on epic store, paid $20 only."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1512,At least can stretch this laptop haha
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1513,World War Z is online multi player game right...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1513,$20plus seems like a good deal.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1514,Can be coop and offline too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1514,That’s why I purchase it.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1514,Can secretly play during work.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1516,True.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1516,Couldn’t tahan for a Long time.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1516,Did you guys update the Drivers by yourself or it’s already updated when you unbox?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1516,Because I noticed my hard disk has several Drivers file but look like it’s been updated before shipping.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1516,Hence why the seal was opened.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1517,how many fans are in it ah?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1517,"like 2 with 1 on either side, 2 but both on 1 side, or just 1 fan?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1518,Not daring enough to open the chassis to see how many fans.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1518,"Anyone want to more games, i just discover Division 2 also on offer."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1518,30 sgd
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1518,only sia.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1518,Tonight gona game!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1519,ok I bought this.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1519,will post review next week when I tested it out.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1520,I ran some updates.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1520,But there weren't many.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1520,Likely because this laptop is so recently manufactured.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1520,"Btw, my package came with seal intact"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1520,"Mine says manufacture date at bottom is 19 May, 3 weeks ago."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1520,First time own laptop that is so recently launched.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1520,Good!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1520,Fewer updates to do.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1521,I think ours are in the same shipment batch
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1522,What updates you ran ?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1522,Couldn’t find driver update but more of windows update only.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1522,I think need to get a laptop stand soon.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,"Here's my personal review about the laptop after using it for about 45 minutes of gaming CS go, mid settings with high performance on battery mode."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,brightness max.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,"Timestamp: 11.30PM, battery at 99%"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,After gaming for about 47 minutes of CSGO
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,"Timestamp: 12.17AM, battery at 18%"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,"So here's what i feel right after ending my game:
-"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,"The keyboard, except for the number pad area feels really hot."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,I think this is common among laptops after gaming?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,"=- as for the bottom side of the laptop where the intake vents is located, the left side is really DAMN hot compared to the right side."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,"But after about 30minutes, it seems to have cooled down while i'm typing here."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,This is something that i'm worried about.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,I think i'm getting a laptop cooler even though I know I hardly gonna game on this laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,"- I'm not used to having the power button on the keyboard, almost tried to press down the key while typing in game as i thought it was delete button."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,Think with more practice i can remember not to press down during work.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,- Battery life at the highest performance drained about 81% while gaming for 47 minutes.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,So i guess you have to plug in your laptop while gaming...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,Not really impressed
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,but i think it's quite common as well.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,=- the exhaust vents at the hinge There gets really warm.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,I'm not sure why they build it that way
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,but I think it should be fine.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,You can hear the fan noise loud but not to the point where it disturbs you.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,Pretty common i guess.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,"As i'm typing on the laptop now, there really isnt much sound coming from the vent."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,"=- If you are the type that have sweaty fingers like me, you probably might want invest in Keyboard cover."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,There are alot of fingerprint on the keyboard
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,"and i'm kinda ""sian"" since it's new."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,Can wipe it off with cloth / tissue so nothing to worry about.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,I haven tried using it for normal work yet.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,But overall this laptop feels decent  for it's keyboard and touchpad.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,"The only thing i'm worried about is the heat generated during gaming session, otherwise no complains for now."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1523,I'm glad that this has both integrated intel UHD 630 graphics and dedicated graphic card so you can save a little battery.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1524,Thanks for the review!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1524,Yeah the battery life is indeed very bad.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1524,They should offer a higher capacity battery model and I would definitely upgrade it.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1524,"Otherwise, this is a v good laptop for its price."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1524,Guess I have to wait till this Friday to receive mine!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1524,"Just departed hefei china at 6.30pm tdy, anyone with the same tracking details?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1525,I think with higher battery capacity means it will be much heavier?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1525,i don't have a gaming laptop before
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1525,but i'm just guessing if the lighter the laptop
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1525,i think the battery span while gaming at high performance is gonna be less than an hour or two.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1526,yeah
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1526,"but i personally dont mind another 100-200g for double the battery capacity, imagine being able to use it for light tasks for a comfortable 9 hours before charging cos"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1526,"given how well it fared for the gaming test, i will be happy it last for 4 hours doing light tasks"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1527,I just played total war: romance of 3 Kingdom..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1527,Superb feel.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1527,Graphics is good and no lag

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1528,Or any other codes.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1528,Thanks!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1529,Close your browser again and open lor
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1530,Personally I felt the keyboard orientation is a little weird for me.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1530,Such as the shift key was too close to WASD layout.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1530,Hence playing any Fps game can make my finger alittle cramp.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1530,Petshijie - Wah nice background!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1530,How you manage to customise the clock ah?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1531,I don’t mind too.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1534,Yeah i think my very old laptop long ago can last me 2
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1534,+ hours on dota 2.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1534,Quite disappointing for the battery life of this laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1534,Anyway i saw there's a rapid charge option to chose.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1534,I read somewhere online saying if you use rapid charge too often it can affect the battery lifespan.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1534,Is that true?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1534,Currently i set it to off.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1534,Hmm i think the shift key is okay.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1534,Just have to get used to it.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1544,It works great without compromising performance at least for me.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1544,"Battery life longer, laptop does not heat up, and totally quiet"

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1589,LOL
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1590,tbh i am not too sure which to go for too but SSDs that is the TLC type usually have lower endurance than the other types.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1590,Tho i am not sure which type is the one not labelled as TLC.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1590,So in this case I will go for the one without.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1590,This is ofc based on my google knowledge
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1590,abt the diff nvme ssd types.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1590,Experts if any pls advise.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1590,"As for the 2280 vs 2242, its the dimensions of the drive."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1590,22mm x 80mm or 22mm x 42mm.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1590,So the 2280 drive is the longer one.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1590,"If its me, I will go for the 2280 one as for 1"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1590,the dimensions is more standard.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1590,2
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1590,Its not labelled as TLC so hopefully iis built using the technology with btr endurance ratings.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1599,Lenovo Vantage is useful.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1599,The pass through power Conservation mode is quite unique to Lenovo laptops I guess.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1599,Battery will degrade less if you spend most of ur time plugged in.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1599,4 Speakers are not bad sounding too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1599,Can get quite loud tho
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1599,maybe its because its quiet now at night.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1599,5 Fast boot times.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1599,Did a restart and it came back up in no time.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1599,6 Feels good to be able to open the laptop with one finger/hand.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1599,Laptop is sturdy and hefty enough and the hinge feels quite solid tho
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1599,it wobbles abit when you push on it.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1599,7 Date of manufacture is 9 days ago for me.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1601,Thanks.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1601,I talked to a live chatter called Moses and he die die
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1601,told me 10% is max.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1601,Then I came back 30mins later and got assigned to Thomas
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1601,gave me 15% immediately lol.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1602,I came to know there are different department handling the chat.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1602,One lady I spoke to cannot give discount and apparently she is from some invoice department.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1602,"Another lady is able to give 10% and when I questioned her, she said she is from quotation dept hence can give discount"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1602,but the discount code will only last 10mins from the point she generates
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1603,How does the battery conservation mode works?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1603,Sorry newbie here.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1603,Do we plug in all the time?

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1604,Conversation mode works by powering the laptop directly using the power brick.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1604,"The laptop will have to be plugged in all the time and instead of charging the battery and the laptop using power from the battery like what most laptops does, Conservation mode means that the battery will not be charged and instead, the laptop will power through the power brick, like a normal desktop, hence the battery will not be constantly charged and discharged."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1605,"One thing i noticed is when the brightness level is dropped down to 0%, the laptop screen goes extremely dark and impossible to see.. is that normal?"

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1607,Yea.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1607,Manage to activate this.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1607,Thanks bros for sharing such wonderful feature.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1607,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1608,Yup!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1608,Very useful feature if you stay plugged in most of the time.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1609,Played around with the laptop just now.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1609,Cooling system is not bad but not the best.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1609,"Room temp is ur avg SG temp, no aircon."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1609,Idle at around 45-50 degrees and at 100% cpu usage its around 70-75 degrees with sustained clock speed of 2.9ghz.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1609,Note that this CPU max clock speed is rated at 4.5ghz.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1609,TDP is limited to 35w at 100% load instead of rated 45w.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1609,Used XTU to undervolt the CPU and managed to achieve -0.160mv stable undervolt.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1609,System crashed at -0.180mv
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1609,so -0.160 is pretty safe.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1609,Cinebench R20 went from a score of 2100+ to 2500+ while CPU temps remains at 70-75 degrees.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1609,Clock speed at load is increased to 3.1ghz.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1609,I think its the best this laptop can do le.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1609,All these is tested at max performance power profile with charger connected eith laptop at conservation mode.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1609,Could have pushed it further if it has a more robust cooling solution.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1609,Any pros in undervolting pls advice
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1609,haha!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1610,Cool!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1610,thank for testing the power of this laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1610,Yea the cooling system is quite average.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1610,The vent at the bottom is what worries me alot
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1610,and i don't really see it cooling down fast.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1610,I think i might invest in a laptop stand rather than laptop cooler
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1610,cause
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1610,i'm bringing this laptop out more often than putting in one place.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1610,Maybe find one in taobao haha.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1611,The undervolt value differs for different CPUs.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1611,Am able to reach -0.160mv for mine
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1611,but many online can only reach a stable -0.050mv for
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1611,their i7-9750H. Have to do trial and error.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1611,Am looking for some foldable laptop stand to stick them to the underside of the laptop..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1611,not sure if there are any!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1611,Will probably do a test to see if raising it above the surface helps at all first
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1611,", cos for some laptops it does not have any difference at all tho, need to blow air in for it to have btr cooling."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1612,I think that this laptop need to have more space on bottom for better air suction while top vent needs blow off
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1612,sideway leh... lol!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1613,"some real world testing, was rendering a video in premiere pro, its relatively fast and even though its not thermal throttling, the cpu is limited to 2.6ghz at full load at 75 degrees."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1613,not looking great.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1613,"thats like 1.9ghz away from max clock speed of the i7-9750H, alot of wasted potential in this laptop."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1613,"for people wanting to get the full potential out of this cpu, i would recommend spending a few hundred more to get one with a btr cooling solution"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1614,So this laptop have bad battery life and not so good cooling system?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1615,i choose the 2280 SSD.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1615,"in the order detail, it is written TLC."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1615,Second Storage Selection	512GB M.2 2280 NVMe TLC
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1616,Can’t say it’s bad battery life when the battery cell capacity is small.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1616,"When we talk about cooling system, it is when the laptop at peak performance, it’s warm."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1616,But normal usage is very cool and quiet.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1617,"Yeah, if only the battery capacity is like 90+wh :/ battery life is on par with other laptops of same specs having the same battery capacity."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1617,"Yeap, laptop is warm at 100% load."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1617,At full load the cooling system cannot keep up with the heat output as seen by the relatively low clock speeds.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1617,"Wouldn't say its bad, its just insufficient and not effective."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1617,"But at least they decrease the clock speeds to keep temps in check at abt 75 degrees, else the lifespan of the cpu will drop significantly."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1617,"Bottom line is at least from my POV, if you want the cheapest laptop at this specs, this is the laptop to go."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1617,"If you need the most power and is a hardcore gamer/editor that wants the most performance, go for others like Aftershock Forge, Legion, Dell G series etc that have better cooling solutions."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1617,But be prepared to pay abt 1.5x to 2x the price for abt the same specs as the fully maxed out L340 Gaming
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1618,"Yes, when I set the brightness level to the lowest, it is totally dark."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1618,Don't see a light sensor on the L340 which in my opinion is very good.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1618,My old Lenovo has a light sensor which adjusts the brightness automatically.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1618,Didn't like that and pasted a sticker over the sensor so the brightness won't fluctuate
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1619,Anybody realise that the charger is making quite abit of noise when using the laptop intensively?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1619,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1620,"When using shopback, need to key in any promo code?"

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1626,Edit:
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1626,"Saw @Angelical093 comment, whoa the discount is even higher than the IT show"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1627,"Nope, no issues for me."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1627,One thing i find it frustrating is that the 2 fingers tap on the trackpad doesnt activate the right click.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1627,Anyone facing this as well?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1628,"Yeah, so strange to have it at such a low brightness."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1628,Really almost 0% sia hahaha!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1629,"seems that with the 18% code applied, it is not tracked by shopback?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1629,I have order on saturday.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1629,but until now it is still not tracked by shopback.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1630,"To enjoy shopback, you have to:
1."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1630,Click the link from shopback website.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1630,2.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1630,"If you have use a desktop browser, you can choose to install the browser extension"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1631,i did click the link from shopback to go to Lenovo website to make my selection and  purchase
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1632,Hmm does the cashback stack?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1632,Like 18% and the 9%?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1632,Best to read the fine prints since both codes are frm shopback.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1633,"according to shopback's official policy, only promo codes featured on shopback can get cashback."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1633,in this case the promo code is actually from shopback
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1633,so there shouldn't be any issue.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1634,Wow!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1634,Nice!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1635,Not true.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1638,This one need to change mouthpad setting
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1639,"I think initially it was like 15%, 7% cashback."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1641,The other mousepad gestures still work.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1642,Yeah i took the GTX1050 as well.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1642,Mine not customised though.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1643,Your mousepad need to click few times b4 it respond?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1644,I think lenovo people must be thinking.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1644,Why so many orders for this laptop
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1645,Nope.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1645,All the other gestures work except the 2 fingers right click gesture.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1646,The gtx1650 shiok.. game medium setting is a Breeze
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1647,Yeah.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1647,Me not laptop flipper.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1647,Intend to last for 6 years at least.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1647,I don't really play game.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1647,Need laptop for work purpose.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1647,Not sure if this is the right one.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1647,Have been searching for the right laptop for really long.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1647,Damn headache.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1647,"I am more concerned about the ventilation, heating element and also the battery life."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1648,My i7-9750H have no problem running at full 4.5GHz.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1648,"Create a new Windows ""Gaming"" power plan using High Performance plan, set BOTH maximum processor and minimum processor states to ""100%"" when ""plugged in""."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1649,"Yup, agree with you."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1649,"For me so far, my old Lenovo has worked well for 7 years until lately acting funny."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1649,So hope this L340 will work as long if not longer.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1649,"If bros here have experience with other brands and models that can last well for some time, pls share"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1650,4.5ghz
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1650,constant at full load?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1650,Hows the temps like?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1650,If its still manageable I will try it later.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1650,If it doesnt then I might just give lenovo a call to see if there's anything I can do abt it.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1651,Mine just arrived today.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1651,Tested without a notebook cooler pad which I will be getting one.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1651,"Tested watching 4k and FullHD videos, no gaming yet."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1651,HWMonitor shows:
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1651,"At between 4.2 to 4.5GHz, CPU temperature between 50+ degrees, highest was 90+ degrees but jumped up to 90+ for only a few seconds."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1654,Yesterday last day for 18%.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1654,Good deals man
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1655,Just checked that I had my cashback rejected
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1655,Rather upset
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1655,since its almost $90
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1655,grrrrr
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1655,See if the shopback CS is able to do anything.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1656,From what i saw from youtube review.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1656,They say the cooling system not that good.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1656,The heat will go up to the screen or something.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1656,So i dare not take the risks buy the 1650 GTX
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1656,"Given the high quality of the laptop, i am hoping it will last 7 years."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1657,Starting of course everything ok.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1657,You give yourself 2 years constantly running at clock speed of 4.5Ghz.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1657,The laptop surely will burn out if not enough ventilation
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1658,Why is your cashback rejected when you use the app?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1659,No more sale???
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1660,1-2 weeks.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1660,Follow the tracking.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1660,Pretty interesting.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1660,Most of ours went on world tour!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1661,How to get rid of the pesky 7 - 8 cm search bar at the bottom of screen?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1661,That pesky bar came about when I just auto updated Windows 10.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1662,I have no idea..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1662,everything was done through app
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1662,Waiting for their CS to reply
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1663,Wow thats pretty long.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1663,Mines in Shanghai right now
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1663,Guess itll take some time
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1664,Ya man.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1664,Don’t even need to anticipate early delivery date.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1665,Right click and select show icon only instead of search bar.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1666,I see.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1666,Whats the cpu usage like?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1666,Streaming 4k video from YouTube or native playback?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1666,In aircon room or outdoors room temperature?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1666,Wanted to test it on my own to see if my cpu can hit the same clocks at sustained loads.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1666,Else my cpu might be one with lower quality
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1667,Thanks bro!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1668,no prob at all
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1669,"btw, can anyone check if your touchpad gesture is working?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1669,particularly the 2 fingers tap to activate right click.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1669,mine's not working.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1670,上海物流大叔在檢查你的訂物時。。。也許會檢查顏色是否健康嘍!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1671,"When I build my own configuration, why can't I opt for a 7200 RPM HD?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1671,There are only two options for HD and both are 5400 RPM.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1672,Jaialt.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1672,My adapter is still giving out alot of noise.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1672,Especially when I'm doing intensive gaming.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1672,Any idea how to resolve this?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1672,Need to lenovo to change?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1672,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1673,That was my question too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1673,Was told that 7200 not available under the customise option.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1674,yeah if its making alot of noise best to check with lenovo.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1674,might be a defect
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1675,would appreciate if anyone who is using the laptop now to help me check urs.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1675,tried installing new drivers but still cnt work
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1676,Touchpad gesture.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1676,- 2 fingers tap to activate right click Not working for me
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1676,If I use 2 fingers press touchpad then can activate right click.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1676,- Scroll up and down
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1676,page
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1676,"ok
-"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1676,Zoom in and out
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1676,ok
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1676,Sorry for the late reply.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1676,I seldom use the L340.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1676,Old laptop still in good mood these days.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1677,Very strange.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1677,The fixed configuration ones come with 7200 RPM HD.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1677,Can we later upgrade the HD ourselves by switching out the HD?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1678,Two finger touch on the pad doesn’t activate the right click for me too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1679,Cooling system of this laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1679,Not very good as expected.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1679,Those gaming laptops with this i7 and the gtx1050/1650 usually have 2 fans on both sides with 4 or more heat pipes and air intakes from the side and outlet at the back to distribute and dissipate heat efficiency.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1680,Ah thank you to ypu and whatme!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1680,"Seems like this issue is not just limited to me, meaning either bad drivers or smt else."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1680,Shall get in touch with lenovo regarding this matter.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1681,看來看去，我只留意到只有一個風扇打風。。。涼風怎麽進？
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1682,这个电脑不是 L340 Gaming.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1682,L340 Gaming 有两个风扇，请看我以下所上传的照片。
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1683,"My 17.3"" version is L340 Gaming:"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1684,I think 2 finger tap need to configure some settings on computer?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1685,Yeah.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1685,For those who get 1650 one.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1685,Good luck to them.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1685,The heat dissipation isnt that good.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1686,"Yeap, but the laptop in the video is the L340 non-gaming version as seen by the CD Drive."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1687,Can your double finger tap activate the right click?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1688,"Hey guys, do we need to register warranty online?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1688,Or it is all automatic?

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1689,哇。。。看來怪怪的。兩個風扇，一進一出擺在一起，氣的流動猶如一直旋轉在一邊。。。就算在冷氣房也沒用喔！
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1690,I havent got my laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1690,Try ask lenovo customer service see how they respond.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1690,I only receive the bag and the wireless mouse
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1691,Wait what laptop is this?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1692,My laptop arrived in Singapore but just did a departure scan
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1692,.. where is it going again?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1692,Lol
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1693,两个都是吹出去的，空气是从电脑下吸进，从后出
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1693,。
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1694,Means reaching you soon alr.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1694,"Same thing happen to me, reached me 2 days ltr."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1695,I gotten the 1650 lo.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1695,At most I will game in medium setting.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1695,I’m just curious
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1695,", wouldn’t be 1650 handle the same graphic level with 1050 with better heat control?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1696,哇。。。就算是在冷氣房，我看縫隙那麼窄。。。也吸不了多少涼氣吧。
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1697,Dammit delivered today but I am not home
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1698,I think 1650 emit more heat because the laptop ia forced to work harder?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1698,"With the same cooling system as 1050, this would mean that the laptop won't handle the heat as efficient as compared to 1050."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1698,Both laptop have same cooling system.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1698,Of course the lower graphic laptop would handle the heat more efficiently with the same cooling system on both laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1698,"So for those getting 1650, better to get another external cooling system."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1698,I don't really need the better graphic.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1698,I using the laptop for work purposes
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1698,and i don't foresee myself installing games to play
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1699,Any feedback on whether the IPS display is decent enough?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1699,Is it too dim at 250 nits?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1700,"nope, 250 nits is plenty bright."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1700,even sitting beside a window my brightness level is around 30-50% and 50% is the max at least for me.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1700,any higher will be uncomfortable for me
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1700,cos
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1700,i usually use the laptop for long periods of time.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1700,if not beside window
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1700,my brightness lvl is around 10-20% only
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1701,internals of laptop if anyone's interested.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1701,lots of wastes space at one side of the laptop if you didnt choose the hdd option.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1701,"even with the hdd option, there will still be abit of wasted space."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1701,could've filled it with a 2nd ram slot or bigger battery
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1702,I guess that space is for the 2nd ram slot.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1702,"Interestingly, via the Live chat, I was told that if I chose the ready-made model, I can upgrade ram later."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1702,My guess is should be using that space.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1703,nope.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1703,this model has a ram slot that is soldered on with 8gb ram leaving you with an empty slot which can be upgraded by users under that silver colored shield on the right of the ssd on the motherboard.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1703,"the empty space seems to be reserved for 2.5"" hdd thou"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1704,yeap!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1704,the 2 black horizontal strips to the left will be covered by the hdd once installed.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1704,there is still some empty space above that beside the fans.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1704,would've been perfect if its filled with another ram slot/battery/exhaust exhaust is totally possible without a redesign of the motherboard.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1705,if you look closely at the bottom of the image the hdd is there.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1705,there is still quite alot of space beside the fans 😭
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1706,For those who receive the laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1706,The UPS delivery man will confirm date with you?

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1713,i managed to reach 500+mbps with my 500mbps plan.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1713,if on 1gbps maybe can go faster.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1713,is the undervolt stable?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1713,you using XTU or throttlestop?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1713,i can undervolt to -0.160 and cinebench runs fine.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1713,but when i start to edit videos my comp just shut down :/
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1713,so leaving it at -0.140 for now
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1714,"So for the 1st deliveryattempt, they will not call you 1st before they arrived?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1714,Then how they know we at home?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1714,"For the mouse and the toploader, they did called and check with me to see if i am comfortable with the date and time though"

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1716,"0.160 and 0.150 is not stable,"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1716,may cause sudden off when running prime95.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1716,*prime95 for load testing.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1717,They called but I was not home
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1717,They did a redelivery today but did not schedule anything.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1717,Luckily I was At home today.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1718,using throttlestop now for different power profiles when on battery/plugged in as well as auto undervolt upon startup.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1718,shall do a 1hr prime95 stress test later on with -0.150

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1719,they deliver they will send sms to ask whether you will be home.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1719,That apply to me when they deliver my mouse and laptops bag.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1719,So they don't do it for the lenovo laptop?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1719,My laptop is in transit already.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1719,Not sure whether they would sms me to inform me in advance that they are coming

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1725,in aircon room?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1725,why the -0.1 undervolt instead of -0.14?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1725,asking as i want to know more info
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1725,so i can better customise my power profiles.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1726,for me i intend to use the laptop for the next 5 years minimum until i graduate.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1726,was rendering out a video last night and max temp was 95 degrees even with -0.141 undervolt.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1726,"decided to custom a profile so when temps reaches 85 degrees, it will drop to 3.2ghz and increase again when temps drop."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1726,basically very aggressive downclocking to keep temps in check.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1726,limited the tdp to 40w only.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1726,maybe i should set a profile to go all out performance like yours only to be used in aircon room.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1733,Can anyone advise on whether it is possible to switch out the HD for my own better HD or even an SSD?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1733,I made the mistake of configuring my system to have a 256 GB SSD and a 1 TB 5400 RPM HD because I didn't know I could opt for a 512 GB SSD
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1733,but only if I don't select any HD.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1733,"The option for a 512 GB SSD doesn't unlock unless the HD option is deselected, which is quite confusing for the customer."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1734,Coolermaster Notepal X3 has been cooling my Dell Vostro 3750 Notebook since 2013 which this notebook was purchased 2nd hand back then.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1734,"Both cooler and notebook still working perfectly,"

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1735,the 256 ssd and 1tb config is good too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1735,you can install your games/apps on the hdd if the ssd runs out of space
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1736,Yes but I'm concerned that the 5400 RPM HD will be super slow
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1737,its not super slow actually.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1737,managed to transfer my files from my usb 3.0 external harddisk to the HDD at 90 - 100 MBps.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1737,can check the speed using crystaldiskmark.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1738,Oh crap.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1738,Mine is also 256GB SSD+7200 rpm HD.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1738,Is it sufficient
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1739,How do you set the hot key?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1740,"Guys, those who had received your laptop: where did your laptop go?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1740,Mine went from Hefei to Shanghai to Korea to Shenzhen and had arrived to Changi today.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1740,However the scheduled / estimated time delivery is 28 June.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1740,Is it going to travel somemore?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1740,Or will it sit at the hub to be delivered on 28th?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1741,Lol same.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1741,Went to korea haha
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1742,"For those who do DIY, u only get 5400rpm 1TB and 256GB SSD."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1742,"For those who choose the made ready one, u will get 7200rpm 1TB and 256GB SSD"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1743,are you using throttlestop too?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1743,can enable hotkey function to switch profiles at the bottom of the options panel.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1744,"Storage should be sufficient, if not can change out to a larger capacity HDD."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1744,"Speed wise should be good too, can use crystaldiskmark if you want to know the exact speed."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1745,"As Long the UPS scheduled delivery date is set, don’t worry about going anywhere."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1745,It will fulfil that day.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1746,Actually i create a thread.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1746,Alot are encouraging moi to change to ssd.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1746,"If i want to change, i also will change to larger ssd."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1746,Hdd kaput very fast siol.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1746,I realised 512GB SSD is cheaper than 256GB+1TB HDD 7200rpm sia with other configuration constant.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1746,I wonder why.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1746,"I tried to configure through the DIY, 512GB SSD costs about 1309."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1746,Normal 256GB+1TB HDD cost 1349.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1746,Thought SSD supposed to be more expensive?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1747,"until now nobody still can figure out or advise on the ""Quick"" and Quiet"" mode supposingly to come with this laptop"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1748,btw I was using my laptop earlier
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1748,and I was monitoring the battery by looking at the details on Vantage.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1748,It stated battery condition was good 2 hrs ago because it was around 25% left
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1748,so I plugged the plug into it to charge and changed it to Rapid so that it will be charged till 100%.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1748,"After charging to 96%, I realised that it got stuck at 96% for a while"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1748,so I checked on the status again
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1748,and I was shocked that it is now showing the battery condition as Poor.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1748,I am a very light user of the laptop
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1748,and I did not even game alot
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1748,or I would say the laptop is like sitting at the corner most time of the day.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1748,"And now when I unplugged the power, the laptop will be shut down."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1748,I cannot power up the laptop even when the battery is showing as 96%
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1748,Moreover I always turned on the cooler when I use the laptop fearing that it will overheat
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1748,yeah
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1748,I know I am paranoid.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1748,Any idea whats the issue?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1749,"SSD good cos its fast, reliable, consume less power, quiet but"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1749,one thing is that it costs more per GB than HDD.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1749,The HDD config costs more
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1749,cos
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1749,it have way more storage than the SSD config.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1749,A 1TB SSD is gonna cost more than the SSD and HDD config.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1749,"I prefer having a SSD + HDD config as I can have windows and my apps installed on the SSD to enjoy fast bootup and app opening times and then store all my media files eg videos, movies, photos, games etc on the HDD."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1749,Its the most economical way as you dont need a super fast storage device to just store videos and all those.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1749,Unless of course you dont store much media files or cash is not an issue.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1749,I edit videos frequently and one project can be as small as 50gb to as much as 300gb++.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1749,Every event covered the photos average out to abt 20gb.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1749,An all SSD laptop will be v expensive.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1750,yeah
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1750,dk wheres the thing lenovo is advertising
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1750,..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1750,i guess my profiles are as good as it gets.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1750,my profile 3 and 4 is totally quiet under full load while 1 and 2 is my quick mode
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1750,hehe
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1751,"Hm from what you've described it seem like you battery is gone case alr,"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1751,cannot hold charge :/
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1751,Best to give lenovo an email and claim ur warranty.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1751,Even if you can fix it urself or suddenly become fixed on its own
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1751,i feel its still best to tell them abt it and see what they can do.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1751,Such issue shouldn't show when the laptop is so new.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1752,What I don't understand is why in the DIY option I couldn't opt for the 7200 RPM HD?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1752,I could only go for the 5400 RPM HD options.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1752,So strange
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1753,yea thats something i dont understand too
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1753,lol
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1753,.. maybe they just wanna save costs
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1753,bah.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1753,Really a strange move from them
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1754,Woah how come new laptop so many issue.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1754,Better check sia
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1755,Ya better check your laptop every single details lo.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1756,Yes.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1756,Mine also got issues.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1756,Adaptor is noisy...

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1757,My profile 3 is able to get 1.5hrs of usage at 33% left when doing just normal browsing.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1757,When just using words can last 2 hours.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1757,Profile 4 will be even more power saving.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1757,If any of you are interested can do that too
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1758,I am going to bring it down to the service centre tomorrow.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1758,I called Lenovo and I can request for a 1-2-1 exchange.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1758,They said they will advise for a repair
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1758,but I dont think I want that route.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1758,Its too new to have such prob.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1759,the laptop still cant power on without the power plugged in?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1759,good that you can request for a 1 to 1 exchange
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1760,Yeah cannot power up  without the power plugged in.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1761,Wonder where the laptop goes...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1761,Isit to the US?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1761,Or idling at the UPS Hub in SG but never update?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1761,Why do they keep strictly to the scheduled delivery date 28 June when it was never set by anyone?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1761,Even Lenovo OVP state expected delivery date is 26 June.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1762,I wish to do it like yours
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1762,but i'm a complete newbie at such things.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1762,Scare do wrongly then screw up my laptop
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1762,Anyway I only switch on my laptop 3 times since purchased.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1762,need to use it and test now.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1762,Surprised to see this thread up till now
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1763,"From our previous order tracking, it will show as in transit even in Singapore because they are transiting to the nearest delivery post office something like that."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1763,Ignore the LENOVO OVP web.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1763,buay zhun lah.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1763,Just follow the UPS scheduled date.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1763,"After knowing that the battery can get defective, kinda afraid of over charging it too."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1764,Actually we should stress test the laptop to its max now that it is brand new to make sure that nothing goes wrong.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1764,If it rly does show some problems then at least can exchange 1 to 1.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1765,Mine same as your but showing 28 expected delivery arrival.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1765,So now not sure if it will come tomorrow or Saturday.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1765,If UPS show expected delivery date 28 mean zhun zhun 28?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1766,So far it has been accurate or earlier for all 3 of my packages.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1767,Yup agree.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1767,What needs to be done to stress out the laptop?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1767,Mine rarely used.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1767,Use for entertainment now and then only.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1767,@tjrsasea:
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1767,Thanks for software rec!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1768,Let it run video / games on 24 hours.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1769,These laptop vacuum coolers can even bring down CPU temps from 100degrees to 60 and below.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1769,More powerful model:
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1770,But we cant use this on the L340 Gaming.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1770,Exhaust vent is at the back covered by the screen
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1771,Wow is the cooling really that bad?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1771,Mine arriving by tomorrow
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1771,and I'm worried.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1771,Maybe should have paid more for the Legion model haha
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1772,Its worse than most gaming laptops.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1772,For the legion
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1772,y540
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1772,you are looking at paying alot more for the same specs as the L340 Gaming.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1772,More than +$500
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1773,Raised the laptop higher and buy a desk fan and blow at the vent lo.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1773,That’s all we can do liao
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1774,"Ya, I understand, my L340 Gaming 17.3"""
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1774,same...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1774,so the Notepal X3 will do the job just fine as well...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1775,All the same...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1775,"with a i7-9750H Processor that can turbo up to 4.5GHz same thing for gaming GPU, any higher priced gaming laptop will face the same heat issues, or thermal throttling..."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1775,"The i7-9750H mobile processor performs better than the desktop i7-7700k, but just below the i7-8700k."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1775,"As whatme says, ""raise the laptop"" above the tabletop surface, higher the better, with a laptop cooler like the Notepal X3."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1775,"Top 3 laptop coolers like the Cooler Master SF-17 does just that  with a powerful fan multiple height adjustments, but more expensive than the Notepal X3."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1776,just sent my laptop to the service centre.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1776,They will escalate to see if I can do a 1 4 1 change.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1776,Usually its to replace the battery only.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1776,"Whey they say repair, does not mean repairing battery cause battery cannot be repaired."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1776,It will be replaced with a new battery.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1776,Seriously its gonna take at least 3 weeks sigh!!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1777,Hi all
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1777,There is some issue with delivery
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1777,"I havent received the laptop, but apparently it has been showed aa delivered."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1777,Who should i contact?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1778,Check your lenevo website for the tracking status.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1778,The tracker
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1778,no.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1778,Provided to u via email might be wrong.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1781,no problem!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1782,wah thats long
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1782,.. did they offer you any loner laptops to use in the time being?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1782,guess they have to ship the battery from China to replace in SG..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1783,great!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1783,enjoy ur laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1783,can just use any benchmarking tools or play some games.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1783,all works
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1783,okay.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1783,Crystakdiskmark to test the storage speeds if you are interested.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1783,You can also do a few battery charging and discharging tests.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1783,try the rapid charge function etc too
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1784,I just received mine as well.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1784,Working
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1784,well so far.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1784,Sorry if I sound like a real noob but if I want to change the HDD to an SSD of my own I can do so right?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1785,"yup, as long as the OS is not installed on the HDD you can do so easily."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1785,Just make sure you get the SSD of the same physical dimensions of the HDD.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1786,"I may sound dumb, but how to ensure OS is not installed in the HDD?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1786,can share the stress tests to be done on the laptop?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1787,Go to This PC and look at the 2 disks available if you have the SSD + HDD available.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1787,They will say how many gb free on the drive.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1787,The one with data alr on it is the one installed with the OS.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1787,"But in this case if you have a SSD and HDD config, the OS is installed in the SSD."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1787,Feel free to swap out the HDD for a SSD if you need.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1788,Can stress test ur laptop using the apps above.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1788,Usually new laptops should have no problem
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1788,de
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1788,"but if you want to be extra safe you got a good working laptop, can test it using say prime95 for an hour to see if ur laptop is stable."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1789,Do you guys have a little back light bleeding in the corners of the screen?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1789,I can see a little
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1790,"Becazue they said since I want to ask for a 1 to 1 change, they will need to escalate to the management which takes 2 weeks"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1791,Yeah mine's at the top left.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1791,Are you planning to contact lenovo abt this?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1792,Very dl with lenevo.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1793,"Best is to just go down and show them, power adapter is not cheap too :/"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1794,I think they will probably say that a little backlight bleeding is normal for an IPS panel.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1794,"Unless the bleeding is extremely bad, they probably won't do anything about it."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1795,is yours very bad?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1795,mine can be seen when the whole screen is black
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1796,Yes mine can be seen as well.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1796,Maybe I'll just ask Lenovo about it.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1796,"Apart from that, I think the laptop is fine."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1796,Can play MK 11 with high settings at 60 fps.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1798,Any recommendations ?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1798,Thanks
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1799,What game u play then got the fizzling sound?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1800,But power adapter more serious than backlight bleed.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1801,The battery life is really crappy
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1802,You mean the blue light from the keyboard?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1802,"I've maxed the blue light, then dimmed the screen until black - don't see any blue in corners of the screen."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1803,Mine also don't have.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1803,"Backlight bleeding for serious one, the black screen will seem 'cloudy' like got white patch"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1804,I'm also starting to notice a fizzing sound when my power is plugged in.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1804,But quite faint.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1804,I don't hear it when running on battery.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1804,Is this a common thing?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1805,Seemed like the fizzing sound is related to the intensity usage of laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1805,I will hear it more when gaming on AAA games.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1805,"But if I play L4d2 or other not so graphic intensive games, no fizzing sound."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1807,It depends on how you gonna use it.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1807,In terms of battery life.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1807,It is really below average.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1807,You get
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1807,around 40-50mins play time on battery.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1807,"If you were to frequently bring the laptop out, I guess it defeat the purpose."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1807,"For me, its a desktop replacer, so I'll always plug it in."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1807,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1808,Definitely worth it for me
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1808,even battery life is poor.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1808,Because it’s common issues for high performance gaming laptop to not have good battery life.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1808,"You want good battery life, go for those Asus vivo book lo."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1808,14 hours also can.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1808,"When it’s on battery mode, the laptop handle so well when watching video, smooth and cool."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1809,"This one cost much less than my old Lenovo laptop, considering the specs."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1809,"Performance wise, so far ok."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1809,Wasn't expecting a true-blue gaming device like Legion.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1809,Got a gaming laptop for the main purpose of being able to launch multiple types of files quickly and reduce chance of lag and hang.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1809,"I don't game much, so this one is ok for my entertainment needs."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1810,so they refused to give me a 1-2-1 citing that the policy is such that 1-2-1 is valid for the 1st 7 days
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1811,"I'm also ask to go down to service center, refuse to let me exchange adaptor one to one which I check other countries they immediately send over new adaptersl after reporting of issue."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1812,I am asking them to re-review their escalation as I told them its too new to have such problem and its making consumer lose confidence with their product.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1812,The CSO who spoke to me said I could ask for 1-2-1 if I dont want repair thus there seens to some differing opinions
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1813,"So far up to now, by using the best battery mode."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1813,I only see two hours of usage.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1813,Never see anything more than that though.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1813,How about you guys?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1814,How did u get 1390 for yr specs ?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1814,Any bro here can share promo code?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1814,I only got 120 bucks off.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1814,Also the shopback works?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1814,I never use shop back before

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1816,2 hours of usage from 100% to 0% on best battery?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1816,What is ur usage patterns like?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1816,"For me can last 3 hours plus, sometimes 4 plus when doing normal browsing and typing and some videos."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1816,I am on my power profile 3 which I customised in throttlestop tho..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1816,its a few pages of posts back.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1817,Sales rep...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1817,"She gave me more than $300 discount, around 308 or so..."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1818,Thanks for all the reply.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1819,Can I buy the laptop via shop back?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1819,But my problem now is the 15 discount is given by lenovo and  not via shopback deal.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1819,Like this can claim shop back
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1819,bo?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1820,Still can go thru shopback.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1820,Its simply just redirect you to lenovo website.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1820,"The discount they gave you will be sent via a quotation into your profile which after shopback redirects you, you have to login anyway and checkout from there."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1820,"Even if the discount is given to you via ecode, you can only add the ecode at checkout."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1824,TIA
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1825,Could someone recommend a laptop cooler I can use with this laptop?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1826,I used this to raise my laptop higher for gaming.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1826,Since the vent at bottom is going in
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1827,No.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1827,I asked.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1827,End up self customised.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1827,Bought and realised shopback did not capture due to ad blocker.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1828,Nice rec.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1828,Used to use similar ones.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1828,Good for working at table.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1828,An elevated plastic stand with fans rotating works too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1828,The latter also works if you are not working at a table.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1828,"A bro had recommended a cooling stand some pages ago, complete with Qoo10 link."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1828,Here's the link again
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1829,"Guys, I have ordered a customized L340 Gaming a few days ago."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1829,I've selected the 4GB soldered RAM ...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1829,Will there be an extra empty RAM slot if I choose the 4GB soldered RAM option?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1829,I want to upgrade it myself.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1830,Guys
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1830,First off.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1830,"Once you are satisfied with existing laptop, you won't bother to keep reading to keep up with what's new."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1830,That is me.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1830,Now i am in need to change a new laptop and
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1830,yes after some comparison between models from various brands out there.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1830,Here i am.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1830,"Decided on this, lenovo L340 with a budget of not more than $1500."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1830,noob question.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1830,Did you guys get your set online via Lenovo website or you guys think those retailers out there will beat website prices?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1831,"This laptop is very new and up till now, none of the retailers are selling this yet."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1831,"I guess if you want to customise your own configuration, go with the online configurator, which lets you max out everything."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1831,"The pre configured models doesnt have an option for 16GB ram, for example."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1831,Their online site is pretty good.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1831,Most of us here got 15% discount from lenovo reps and another 9% from shopback.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1831,"That's 24% off listed price unless they count the 9% off from the price with the 15% discount applied, then it will be a little lesser than 24%."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1831,Plus all the $0.10 to $1 accessories.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1831,"I got the Lenovo Gaming backpack, the normal Lenovo bag, toploader bag, mouse and mouse pad for just $2.30 more iirc."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1831,I would say all these is pretty hard to beat.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1832,"Hey bro, thanks."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1832,Do advise on the 9% cashback.hows
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1832,"does it work, apply to the online site?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1832,And how to get the 15% from lenovo reps.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1833,Depends on model you may try.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1833,GSS
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1833,SPINSAVE15P
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1834,thank you
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1835,Same here.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1835,My IT stuff are used until obsolete or dead
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1835,"So when I get new ones, I prefer to get the very latest models."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1835,"Got mine via Lenovo website, same as most bros here."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1835,Also got the same discounts and similar add-ons as tjrsasea.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1835,"1 thing to note about this laptop is the short battery time, as experienced by many here."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1835,Battery time depends on what you run - games vs. surfing the net vs. videos vs. programming vs others.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1835,Also whether it is numerous applications vs. few applications.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1835,So really depends what you intend to use the laptop for.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1844,or any other laptop to recommend?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1845,So far so good.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1845,Only negative point is battery life.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1846,I got the transparent version.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1846,Sadly they don't have TPU transparent so no choice have to go with silicon.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1847,i see.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1847,"if for normal school use, the battery life can last up to 4 to 5 hrs ?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1848,So far i been using for normal work.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1848,I think about 2.5 to 3 hours on average with the battery performance set to the best battery life.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1849,i see.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1849,i still thinking should i get this laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1849,is it worth buying?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1849,or any other brands or model to recommend?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1850,"Generally speaking, this laptop is really worth the price for it's specs and massive discounts"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1850,/cashback you can obtain from lenovo itself and shopback.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1850,I doubt there are any laptops out there with the same specs that can beat this price point atm.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1850,"However, this laptop has a battery issue which drains rather quickly even when doing normal work."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1850,Most likely due to it's graphic card component.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1850,And sadly it weighs about 2kg but doesn't matter to me.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1850,"My suggest is that, if you do graphic work / gaming mid specs often and wish to buy a laptop that is decently specs, this would be the best purchase cost between 1k to 1.4k depend on your customisation."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1850,"For me, i can close one eye on the battery life and the weight as that isn't my concern."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1850,You can also look at how many people eyeing on this laptop and purchased it in the end.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1850,I leave it to you to decide
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1851,I agree.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1851,The cooling isn't very good also

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1853,do i need to change/upgrade on my warranty to onsite and add in Accidental Damage Protection?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,Nice to see that you're eyeing on this.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,"Between the 3 option, i only see changes in the hard drive and RAM."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,"If you hardly run high demand programs adobe premiere, multiple programming application, etc, just an 8GB RAM would be fine."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,16GB will help only if you are running a few demanding programs at once.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,"But if you can afford it, then go ahead."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,Nothing wrong with splurging more on RAM.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,"As for the hard drive, if this is your main computer i.e you don't have a desktop or other computer"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,or you like to store photos
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,", videos, install programs, then suggest you to get the 1tb +256gb SSD."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,The 512GB SSD only option is better if you're not gonna put in many programs / storage items.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,You'll run out of data fast.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,"But with that said, you can always buy a external hard disk."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,It's your decision to chose.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,"Warranty onsite or accidental damage protection is up to you, but the price point isn't really worth it in my opinion"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,"you're buying like 1k+ laptop then spend on insurance,"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,"abit bo hua ""not worth"""
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1854,la unless you're getting those 2.5k++ gaming laptop
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1855,thanks for your reply.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1855,"i been thinking for weeks, and dont know which laptop to get."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1855,i am noob in IT specs.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1855,i thinking to get a laptop that can last me for 2 years for school use.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1855,i dont want to spend so much for a laptop as i have to pay for my school fees.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1855,"i seldom game, just normal school use, download songs."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1855,"after reading reviews etc, i think for a price of 1,200 to get a i7 gen 9"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1855,", i think is consider a good deal."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1855,but dont know if the laptop is working well or not.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1855,"am afraid halfway haywire, and carry in warranty not covered."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1855,"if i choose the price of 1,232, good enough?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1856,"Imo, the price-point of this laptop is good for the specs."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1856,"If you are doing basic stuff like surfing and working on documents, there are even cheaper Ideapad models out there compared to this gaming one."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1856,"Really depends what you want to do with the laptop, then consider the specs."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1857,Intel -H is very demanding and sucks battery very fast...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1857,And considering battery is 3-cell type.... very small battery capacity...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1857,means you will be charging the laptop very frequently ...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1857,almost Like plug in to power supply all the time.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1857,If on battery ....
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1857,maybe wont even last you 1.5 hour.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1858,I see.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1858,"If you aren't gaming much means not touching on graphic intense game, Dota and csgo still ok, then you should consider other laptops which are meant for school."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1858,I believe there's lighter option and comes with i7 as well.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1858,I'm not a notebook expert
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1858,but I think this laptop like not worth to you
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1859,"For your use case, i would suggest you get the i5 version instead."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1859,graphics card can stick to the 1050 3gb. 8gb ram will do too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1859,storage can get 128ssd plus 1tb hdd.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1860,"A powerhouse is not for you for this new Lenovo IdeaPad L340 series, with a 3-cell battery, it's more like a desktop."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1860,Battery too small capacity.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1860,"I have used Acer Swift 3 for more than a year for work - lightweight, good battery life on the move, up to 12hrs."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1860,"Screen is IPS, good display quality."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1860,Storage mostly SSD.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1860,Get it from the Acer Official Store on Lazada or go to shop and bargain.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1860,Lowest I seen was $800++ on sale.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1862,"Depends on

2."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1862,your expectations
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1862,Many have feedback on the poor battery life for this laptop.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1862,Also the design of the air vent near the screen.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1862,"Personally, I really like the blue backlight, and it can cope with what i want to use the laptop for."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1862,If you are looking for something that is value for money.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1862,I think this one fits the bill.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1862,Although there could be other value for money laptops out there.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1863,Wheres the best place to buy lenovo laptop cheap outside of those IT show period?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1864,"can buy online via Lenovo website, check out with SPINSAVE15P will do."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1869,"Nice shares, but still considering to buy from Malaysia 🤣🤣"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1870,Finally there is an answer to the Quick and Quiet mode.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1870,"For quick or quiet mode, please press Fn+Q to toggle."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1870,Please try and let me know if this will work for you.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1871,"Thanks for sharing, bro!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1871,It works for me.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1871,But I wonder where I can see the mode selection other than the quick flash of the icon on the screen.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1871,Also haven't figured out the difference between the 2 modes.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1871,Any buddy here can advise?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1871,Thanks!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1872,must capital Q?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1872,Cant get it to work tho
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1872,.. how do you even see the switch in the first place
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1873,I saw somewhere from the comments that you need to Download 2 Lenovo app vantage +
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1873,another one then you are able see an indicator about the switch explicitly.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1873,I have no time to explore yet.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1873,Go read the comments from the fb link I gave
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1874,Can play overwatch in high settings ?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1875,yup i tried everything that they state there already
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1875,but still cant see anything about the switch.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1875,able to take a pic to show what you see when you switch profiles?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1876,"Boot into Bios, you can select there."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1876,Something like this
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"Hello Everyone,
At the beginning I would like to say Welcome to everyone at the forum, as I have just joined"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"So, coming back to main topic."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"I have recently bought L340, the 17 version, with spec including: - i5 9300H. - GTX 1650."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,- 8 GB RAM.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,- custom
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,480GB SSD added by reseller
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"After reading entire topic, I've also bought notebook cooling pad, Cooler Master Notepal U3"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,Plus - that is great as it allows You to place fans right in a place when air vents are in our case at the very back of the notebook.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"Currently I am monitoring temps with RealTemp when notebook stands on the cooling pad, but additional fans are turned off."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"So far, I have experienced maximum of 85C, after long gaming session like 10 hours or so, and the top of the case including keyboard was warm, but never hot."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"So even without additional vents, placing notebook on a stand where he can get more air, helps a lot."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,Soon I am going to enable additional fans to compare temps in similar gaming session.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,Haven't done any undervolting or changes yet.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"Default settings, clean Windows installation + Lenovo softs/drivers."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"In conclusion, I am quite glad from the overall especially considering the price/performance ratio, at least for now."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"There is just one thing that annoys me a lot, and I should warn You about it."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"Notebook has an ""Always On USB"" ports option."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,It keeps USB ports powered up all the time also when turned off completely as long as charger is plugged in.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"I contacted Lenovo about it, and unfortunately this."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,CANNOT BE TURNED OFF.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,Why is is troublesome?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"Well If You have notebook cooling pad that is USB powered like the one that I mentioned above it is never turned off, unless You unplug it out of USB port after every notebook shutdown or unplug the charger after every shutdown doesn't make any sense for 17' desktop replacement."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"Any additional USB devices like usb light etc, will also be powered on like 100% of time."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"So far, I haven't find any solution/workaround for that."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"I am considering using external USB charger to power cooling pad, extended with some smart plug that would be turned on/off via some script at Windows startup/shutdown ."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1877,"Regards,
Patryk"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1878,Update your Lenovo Vantage app through the microsoft store.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1878,I think there is an option there to turn off always on power for the USB ports.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1879,Already did that.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1879,There is no option for my model.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1879,Also Lenovo support:
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1880,isn't ur model the same as ours?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1880,will take a screenshot for you to see later
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1881,"Oh, I hope it is."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1881,"I went through entire Lenovo Vantage and didn't find the option,"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1881,so screen would be perfect.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1881,I can also see Lenovo Vantage Beta in Microsoft Store.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1881,Maybe thats the way to go.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1882,Thanks!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1882,I'll give it a try.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1883,When you press Fn+Q
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1883,"I use lowercase q, you will see in white in the middle bottom of screen."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1883,- a snowflake with a side profile of a person with finger near mouth should be the quiet mode.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1883,- a speedometer for the other mode
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1883,"Sorry, I can't paste screenshot in Word and attach here."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1883,The L340 is my standby laptop
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1883,and I haven't installed Word yet.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1883,"Only use L340 for entertainment - gaming, music and video."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1883,Using my old laptop as I type this.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1884,Using paint for Screenshot is the easier way.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1884,Then upload to an image hosting site
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1885,Anyone purchase a laptop using shopback18 during the promotion last month and successfully gotten the 9% cashback?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1886,"Mine will come in on 17 Aug. From what I see, shouldn't be a problem."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1886,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1887,"lol, my cashback failed even though I used the correct code and the clicked activity was tracked on shopback."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1887,I emailed to shopback and they said that cashback was not approved by merchant.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1887,Felt like getting scammed
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1888,Really?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1888,Mine state it will reflected by 16 Aug.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1888,Not sure will go through or not.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1888,Not approve by agent for what reason?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1888,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1889,Here it is - the 2 icons you will see when you press Fn Q
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1890,The reason they gave me was the cashback was not approved by the merchant.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1890,Shopback/lenovo is a fking joke.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1890,I used the correct promo code and the click activity was tracked.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1890,No reason why lenovo did not approve the cashback.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1890,"shopback told me there's nothing they can do, only can reimburse me $15 dollars out of their own pocket"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1890,lol...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1890,They shortchanged the customer when the problem is between the two companies.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1891,That's strange.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1891,"I just checked mine, $98 confirmation."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1891,Why not try emailing lenovo to see which department handles with shopback then escalate it from there?

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1900,What's the name of the cable that connects the adapter rectangle heavy box to the laptop?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1900,Not referring to the end that connects the adapter to the power outlet.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1900,Asking cos that part of the cable for my old Lenovo laptop is loose and can only charge the battery when angled and held.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1900,So I want to get a replacement.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1900,Thanks!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1901,For Windows just download the ISO from Microsoft.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1901,Use media creation tool.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1901,The license is embedded in your BIOS so no need to key in any product key.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1901,For office check with microsoft.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1902,"Thanks, will try that out."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1902,Waiting for my SSD to be delivered.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1903,Any bros here kena laptop reboot due to driver power state failure?

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1904,I also kena no shopback
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1904,cos lenovo informed shopback that they did not capture my order via shopback link.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1904,I sweared it did it correctly.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1904,End up shopback give me 25 bucks
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1905,I saw from the site.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1905,",  for L340-15IRH"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1905,"these are the Storage device:
- 2.5-inch storage drive"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1905,=- M.2 solid-state drive

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1905,"My question is:
1"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1905,"Can I install optane memory I will have 2TB 5400rpm harddisk, m.2 SSD and optane memory?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1905,2
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1905,"If yes, will it be useful?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1905,"I am very new to optane memory, please advise."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1905,TIA.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1906,"I even have the shopback google chrome extension, those low amount cashback no problem, big amount suddenly got problem."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1906,I wouldn't be so angry about it if it were my own fault also
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1907,Off topic but seems like Lenovo doesnt offer SSD plus HDD with the customise option anymore?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1907,Instead only offer optane memory?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1907,"For your first qn, dont think you can have all 3."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1907,From the pics of the laptop there is only 1 HDD drive bay and 1 M.2 slot on the motherboard.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1907,So you gotta choose between the optane and the SSD.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1907,"For me, I will go for SSD instead of optane as the optane memory doesnt count into your storage capacity."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1907,It acts like a cache to your HDD
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1907,"so your HDD will perform better, ie load games faster, boot faster etc."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1908,Does the laptop feel warm after long hours 3 or 4 hours

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1909,I had select 2TB HDD and my selected 256GB SDD is removed automatically.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1909,I didn't notice the SSD was removed and thus I bought 1 without SSD.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1909,"Ok, will forgo the Optane and stick to 1 SSD and 1HDD."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1909,Thanks bro.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1910,Easy bro -

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1911,Agree.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1911,The cooling isn't very good also but that's probably par for the course when it comes to gaming laptops.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1921,The IdeaPad L340 has two distinct modes:
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1921,Quick for gaming and Quiet for working.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1921,"Each mode looks, feels, and acts differently."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1921,"Simply flick between the two based on what you need to do."""
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1921,-.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1921,"I found it - it's in the BIOS under ""Configuration"" - ""System Performance Mode"""
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1921,"Options are: ""High Performance Mode"" and ""Quiet Mode""."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1921,I played around with it a little and didn't really see any difference.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1921,By default it was on High Performance.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1921,"Really appreciate the thread, it helped me decide to give the L340 Gaming GTX1650 a try."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1921,So I thought I'd give back since I finally found where that 'simple flick' switch is.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1921,"All the best,"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1921,Peter
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1922,"well, i found these thread after i bought the GTX1050 version which i have to make a decision because my 1st gen i5 laptop decide to died on me"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1922,and i did watched a couple of yt reviews.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1922,"i'm pretty much does just casual ""retro"" gaming aka"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1922,"emulating retro consoles, i.e. PS2, gamecube, still looking for xbox solution."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1922,*
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1922,*
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1922,** about gaming pc
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1922,but my choice of getting just the 1050 version was purely base of my past experience with emulators graphic.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1922,and migrating from 1st to now 9th gen i7 high performance cpu just make me WOWWW....
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1923,"damn, there's like 4 sizes"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1923,"and i google the ssd used by the OEM aka samsung mzvlb512hajq-000l7, NVMe PCIe M.2 512GB."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1923,"yup, the longest among all sizes."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1924,"I came across this extender and similar stuff on ebay, under 2 bucks."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1924,Guess you don't need to repurchase another if their of the same spec but simply extend it.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1924,And I think you can also DIY it by getting a perfboard from simlim tower.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1925,Anybody facing the problem of their laptop's keyboard not working after all the latest updates?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1925,"The bios and drivers updates through the lenovo vantage, the windows updates etc."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1925,I have to do system restore back to a previous point as device manager keeps showing different error codes about the system registry...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1925,weird.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1926,Keyboard is ok for me but power-up button is lit up even when battery is almost fully charged.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1926,Didn't notice that before.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1926,"Not a big issue for me, so I'm just ignoring it."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1927,"Thanks bro, I bought a new one and is working now."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1927,For those who wanna know which SSD confirms will work.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1927,I am using Crucial P1 500GB NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 Internal SSD.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1927,"But I think any ""NVMe PCIe"" should work."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1927,"Lenovo technical support can only confirm up to 512GB will work, he can't confirm for 1TB."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1927,Below is their reply:

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1927,We aren't sure if 1TB will be supported or not as there might be a compatibility issue.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1928,Can't seem to access lenovo website via shopback.com...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1928,Is the link down?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1929,"nope, everything seems fine here"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1929,but i think thats
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1929,"because i totally don't bother about vantage, i only go for the regular windows update."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1929,"and any update that dues with the onboard hardware, i will probably not go for it."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1929,"well, if its not broken don't fix it."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1929,i have similar experience with my previous hp laptop
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1929,", the hdmi output simply stop working after updated the graphic driver."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1930,good to know that.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1930,now i want to add a secondary sata drive but don't know where the ribbon port is located on the motherboard and further more
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1930,i don't even know where to get the adapter itself
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1930,any clue??
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1931,"abit sian hais, went into the registry to edit some codes using some online tutorials."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1931,dont even know how long this fix will last and if future updates will affect it.. will see how it goes.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1932,still dk why the laptop doesnt come with the sata cable to install the drive if we opt for the non HDD L340 models.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1932,I believe other models like the Y540 does come with them included in the box
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1933,"Ya, very troublesome."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1933,"i mean how much does it cost, 50 cents?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1933,its just a piece of plastic attached to a cable.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1933,I found the part #
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1933,but the only website with stock is selling it >US$50 !!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1933,WTF
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1934,L340 AMD or Intel better ?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1934,"I am using for web surfing, youtube and just light gaming"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1935,"think you got it wrong, L340 is the ideapad series."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1935,"well, you never go wrong by choosing intel unless price is the issue."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1936,i am refering to the below 2 laptos for the L340 series.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1936,The AMD one is cheaper than the intel version
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1936,so i am wondering if there is a significant difference between the two.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1936,https://www.lenovo.com/sg/en/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-l-series/Lenovo-IdeaPad-L340-15IWL/p/88IPL301158

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1937,AMD chipset seem better on paper but both are not in any case performance CPU.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1937,and most definitely both variation will endup thermal throtter themself especially for those config that only comes with integrated graphic when chip run into any performance bottleneck.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1937,"meaning, without any sort of third party graphic, those model can handle older or less graphic intensive games."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1937,but if you try to run e.g. street fighter 5 the system will endup like a toaster and slow like a snail.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1938,I just ordered one from the Lenovo website.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1938,"For mates who also ordered there, may I know what was your delivery duration?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1939,quote myself.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1939,Free Gift is 1TB lenovo portable HDD
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1940,"For free gift, I think have to cut out the sticker label from box and with the receipt, go down to redemption center @"

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1940,Nobody will respond to email enquiry one....

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1941,What a waste!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1941,could have saved $120 more..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1942,"no, I just email them with my order number, etc."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1942,"and yes, their customer service in charge of email is very bad and sucks."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1942,I had to go to their Live Chat to disturb them twice to check and reply my email before they process the redemption.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1942,they mail the free portable HDD to my house like they did with the laptop
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1943,how much did paid for including delivery charges?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1944,i think the redemption center you guys mention is letrain.....
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1944,"don't bother about contacting them they simply don't care, i tried."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1963,"My requirements are not that heavy as I don't game, I just need a daily driver to do 4K video editing from my camera and DJI Osmo Mobile, Photoshop edits and some GPU-intensive Google Earth Studio animations without any lag or hiccups."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1976,-1.6 will auto reboot
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lenovo,Ideapad,1976,However temps still crazy hot and will shoot to 98 when gaming

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2016,"WE'RE SORRY,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2016,BUT THERE ARE NO MODELS AVAILABLE
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2016,AT THIS TIME
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2016,How did u guys try and configure the laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2016,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2017,"Oh sux, maybe they forget to inflate the price."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2017,They take down first than later maybe price adjust above $1k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2018,Can what
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2019,vega 8 <
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2019,mx150
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2019,right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2019,seems like 10-20% difference
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2019,"sure it's 1.75kg in 15.6""?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2019,hard to beat this weight/screen ratio
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2020,e485 1.75kg.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2020,e585
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2020,2.1kg
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2021,Oh now can already.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2021,Just now tried at 8am
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2021,it says no models available.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2021,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2022,Maybe website on update?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2023,Yes but take note for lappy with Mx150.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2023,"On default is Intel HD, geforce only kick in during game and etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2023,AMD wise one chip and on default is Vega 11 so no switching.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2024,any known heat issues with ryzen 5?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2025,I have a slight concern on the heat dissipation issue with AMD processor too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2025,"I am  looking at the 14"" one."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2025,I wonder why the 256GB SSD which should hold the Win 10 OS is installed as 2nd drive while the 1st drive is left empty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2025,Isn't the system drive is always installed as 1st drive?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2025,Anyone here can enlighten me?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2025,"I went AddOn at Bugis Junction this afternoon, trying to take a look at the actual notebook."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2025,But I was told it is only available online.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2026,Not bashing Intel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2026,Try using a Intel H 6 core with 1050 graphic lappy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2026,That lappy is have is really hot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2026,Ryzen 5 is 15watt APU so unlikely to have hot issues since it is low wattage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2026,"U can read review on laptop based on it, they did not mention about overheating."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2027,I am more concern with the battery life.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2027,It's 45w
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2027,only so does it last at least 5 hours ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2028,"Based on capacity, probably not."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2028,"But with a 768p display, it probably could."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2029,seems like HP might bring in AMD specs as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2030,Yes the HP Envy X360 as well as Probook/Elitebook.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2030,However not below $1k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2031,"Heat problem or not, we will only know if we try it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2031,This is running a 15W processor which I feel should not be a big concern with the thick chassis on this ThinkPad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2031,"I think it is just a perception that if it is AMD, it will run hot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2031,"To give you a little comparison, my Lenovo Miix 720 with a i5 7200U could hit over 80 degs under load."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2032,Review on Ideapad 720S which is also fitted with Ryzen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2032,5 2500U indicate inadequate cooling leading to throttling of processor under heavy load.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2032,Let's hope Lenovo has learnt the lesson and made necessary improvement on these new models.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2033,For those who assume AMD is hot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2033,Do not based on the preception of Ideapad 720s as that one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2033,is Lenovo lazy design.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2033,As they recycle the design from Intel version and think it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2033,will work but it failed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,You can read the previous gen Thinkpad A275 based on AMD Bristol Ridge.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,No mention about overheating except slow system performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,The 2500U is 15Watt TDP so unlikely to overheat.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,"Unless processor like Intel H series 6 core rated at 45watt TDP,
the temp under load can go as high as 80 degrees."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,If we are talking about processor with 45W TDP than perhaps
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,but.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,it is 15Watt TDP.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,Anyway for those who think AMD is slow and hot don't get it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,Not citing AMD still have the issue if you are not comfortable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,or confidential in AMD laptop than just get Intel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,Most Intel laptop comes with Intel UHD and optional graphics.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,like Geforce/Radeon which means more $.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,AMD Ryzen based laptop is one chip with decent CPU and Vega graphics.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,On default for AMD laptop will be Vega while Intel is the crappy UHD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,That is why most laptop for Intel usually comes with discrete graphic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,as Intel UHD is CMI.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2034,Intel UHD have to be enabled to save power especially on battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2035,Just ordered one @ $815.03 this morning for my daughter as her Acer Aspire 5 is getting old and we would not want to have sudden failure in notebook interrupting her course work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2035,"Chosen 2x4GB ram, 65W charger and Win10 Home since her don't play games and her course work has no video editing, should not be too taxing on memory and processing power."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2035,Just hope everything goes well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2036,"I've not seen the chassis used by the ThinkPad, but realistically, any thin profile laptops tend to suffer from throttling."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2036,It is just a matter of how much it gets throttled.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2036,The same applies to Intel's 15W processors too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2036,"Case in point, my Lenovo Miix 720."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2036,"Even assuming that thermals is not the issue, 15W processors will still throttle because of the low power limit."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2036,This is especially the case when you are gaming because both the CPU and GPU are under load.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2037,One thing do take note is after you got the unit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2037,Do a fresh install of the OS than load all the driver properly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2037,Out of the box OS usually are slow and bloated with junks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2038,I don't do this.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2038,"For me, I will just go in an remove all the bloatware that I don't use and run a registry cleaner, e.g. CCleaner."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2038,Even Win 10 itself will install rubbish like Candy Crush and a bunch of other games.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2038,"Nowadays with SSDs, slowness due to too many apps is not that apparent as those mechanical drive days where I will always format my PC/ laptops annually to spur it back to a ""speedy"" state."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2039,Noted with thanks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2040,True.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2040,I have been running my Intel E8400 desktop Win 10 with only 4GB DDR2 RAM for some time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2040,Simple word processing and web browsing are no problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2040,"With latest intel processor and 8GB DDR4 RAM, the performance should be faster than my present desktop except for video perhaps."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2040,But then my daughter does not play PC games.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2041,Please post your thoughts when you get it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2041,Tia
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2042,"With Win 10, a SSD is almost a must if you want a responsive PC."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2042,"With the mechanical drive being the significantly slowest part in the PC nowadays, it will take a toll on performance/ responsiveness big time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2043,on specs it puts 2700..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2043,but don't seem to have this option?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2044,I cant access the customisation page for 485/585 on both web and mobile.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2044,Anyone else facing the same issue?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2045,Not bad leh
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2046,for me is e485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2046,lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2047,Why not?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2047,You can go to the link shared on the first post and go back one page where it says ThinkPad E Series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2048,"Just playing around a bit with the E485 customization, and I feel this is the better size for a laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2048,"Also some options are quite good to upgrade or downgrade,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2048,"1 Display - Upgrade to full HD,
2"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2048,Memory - Upgrade to 2x8GB DDR4 2400.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2048,3 Second Hard disk
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2048,=- I chose to downgrade since I have spare PCI-E/ NVME SSDs to upgrade.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2048,Downgrade to 128GB saves 70 bucks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2048,4
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2048,Power cord - Default is 45W. Upgrade to 65W with rapid charge for +2 bucks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2048,should be a must upgrade.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2048,"All in, 857."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2048,Superb price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2049,"Same as my customization,  I presume we still can add a 2.5 into the laptop?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2049,Sent from Sony Z4 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2050,"They have the option of another secondary drive, and there looks like mechanical drive options in there."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2050,So I think it is save to assume that there is space for a spare drive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2051,can already.. previously could not.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2051,haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2052,"At first thought how come it's secondary drive, mayb pri drive is soldered on it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2052,might buy it if not getting a new phone

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2053,Think can add a HDD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2053,Iirc a 1tb is $65
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2054,Ermm none of u is concern with the 1x1 wifi specs?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2055,There is a 2x2 Wifi FRU but is Realtek model
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2055,FRU number 01AX739
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2055,No need to thank me
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2056,"Oops, thought I saw QCA QCNFA435AC with Bluetooth Version 4.1, and there's no option to upgrade in the E485 configuration page."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2056,Did I miss something?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2057,Yes total FRUs !=
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2057,Available on Configuration Page.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2057,FRU = Whitelisted in Lenovo BIOs
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2057,If you know how to mod Lenovo BIOs every Lenovo PCIe card also pin compatible.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2057,Nowadays due to RSA signing need to use external flasher to mod BIOs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2057,All the pin straps protected
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2058,Don't worry so much about the WiFi card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2058,"The fact of the matter is that for the past 2 years, Lenovo had quietly removed the WiFi whitelist from the system firmware in Thinkpad laptops."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2058,The WWAN card whitelist is still in place though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2058,So all you need to do is just buy from Lazada / eBay /
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2058,<insert random e-commerce site here> any 2x2.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2058,M.2.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2058,"WiFi card, install it into the Thinkpad and it will work."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2058,Don't need to specifically get a Lenovo FRU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2058,"Anybody who claims that Thinkpads still use firmware whitelists, mini-PCIe WiFi cards and still employs a legacy BIOS is living under a rock."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2059,Wah its like u guys did a deep check on what's Lenovo is doing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2059,Well I'm pretty much concern of WiFi card as well since as u said 1X1 and 4.1v which I
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2059,it's pretty common among some budget laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2060,"For the price and specs on a ThinkPad, something has got to give."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2060,"And if it is the WiFi, then can consider changing it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2060,Worst case just get an external one and leave the internal one in case you want to lug it out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2061,Looks like these are out of stock now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2061,Luckily managed to hoot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2062,E series is always budget laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2062,L is another low budget laptop series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2062,The real higher end business laptops are X followed by T series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2062,Price is right for a budget laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2062,Nothing to shout about other than the AMD X-factor here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2063,its back on the web liao
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2064,Is the speed for this kind of SSD fast?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2064,Second Hard Drive : 256GB Solid State Drive PCIe

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2064,2280 16GT/s
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2065,Could be the usual OEM SSD like Samsung 951 that kind  I think?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2066,"I hope it's comparable to the one on the xiaomi laptop pro 15.6"""
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2067,I doubt they will use a Samsung SSD for a budget laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2067,"At this price range, it could be a Liteon SSD."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2071,Come in ssrr.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2072,I have a LiteOn M.2 SSD in a laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2072,"Two years later, slow until i thought my mouse got problem never click the folder properly, turns out its just damn slow
."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2072,"Terrible, would not recommend."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2073,I am just speculating cause I did not buy this ThinkPad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2073,I only suspect they may use the likes of Liteon since it is a common OEM brand.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2074,Yep.. my last Acer laptop was using a 512gb liteon.. very slow compared to Samsung..

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2075,Most manufacturer won't add in a speedy SSD because of $.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2075,"If they add in Samsung SSD, the overall price will jack up a fair bit."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2075,"They usually use cheap SSD brand like LiteOn, Toshiba."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2075,"Sandisk also very rare seriously, even if they use Sandisk it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2075,will be X series which is intended for OEM market.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2075,and low power type not speed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2075,"My Dell G3 is using Sandisk X600, not a speedy drive"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2075,but.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2075,it is decent enough.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2075,"As for WIFI, it's a E series Thinkpad which means budget."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2075,Unlike T series you won't have option for better WIFI.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2075,or even LTE.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2075,"Take note if this E series sell well, maybe they will sell the."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2075,A series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2075,A series will be the premium version like last time there was.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2075,E475 and A475.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2076,The laptop did not come with the mouse and case?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2076,"If not, did they put down how long is the shipping?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2076,Just ordered one too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2076,Thanks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2077,"Ya, they ship separately, you can track your order from the email."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2077,It takes about a week or 2.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2078,+1.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2078,Dont expect top quality for such a price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2078,I think the specs are good enough for the price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2079,That is my point below $1k unlikely to have better specs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2080,"It's the only 16gb ram laptop I can find for this price, with the bonus of usb c charging."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2080,So fair enough.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2080,The next best thing would be a aftershock p-13
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2081,"I believe I've used Liteon SSD's previously, and in fact, I still have a Liteon Zeta mSata SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2081,"It is not blazing fast like Samsung, but I don't think it is lacking in any way."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2081,SSD is still a better alternative as compare to a mechanical drive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2082,"Haha, eagerly await benchmarks from early adopters."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2086,I think you mean 840 Evo?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2086,"Anyway like I said, SSD is still better than giving us a 5400 rpm drive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2086,"For day to day usage, I don't think it is a problem."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2086,You likely will only see how fast when running benchmarks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2086,"Even the Intel X25 160GB G2 that I still have, is still good enough"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2086,and I don't experience any lag whatsoever.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2087,You can always opt for the cheapest storage option and do your own upgrade.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2087,Lenovo is not a custom/ DIY desktop and laptop manufacturer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2087,So it is to be expected that they will sell you a full and working laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2088,I opt for a 512 GB drive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2088,"If it turns out to be a crap drive, just dump it into an USB 3 enclosure and use your own drive"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2089,really?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2089,which brand and model?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2090,"For those interested in the review of the E485 and 585, you can check out the link below."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2090,"Based on this link, the E480 and 580 should use pretty much the same chassis/ design as the Intel version of it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2090,Cooling is not good most likely due to the cooling solution having to handle both the Intel CPU and dedicated GPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2090,"But for Ryzen, it only needs to cool a single chip."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2091,how does this amd setup compare to i5+mx150?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2091,good enuff to play dota?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2092,"As in the e485 configuration, I opted for 512gb."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2093,"It is not as fast compared to an i5 and MX150 combination, but is not very far away in terms of performance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2093,"Dota should not be an issue for the Ryzen APU, but subjected to the graphical settings."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2093,It definitely will lag if you run at native resolution with all the graphical settings jacked up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2094,"Just take note for those intending to change HDD, it may void."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2094,the warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2095,What I meant is the SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2096,Doesn't mention in website.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2096,With almost foc upgrade to 3 year warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2096,It's a very good deal.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2096,Can't buy now as my notebook is still working ok.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2097,"I think if there is no warranty seal, it may not be a problem."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2097,What I used to do is to pull out the hard disk and store it somewhere without deleting the data in there.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2097,"If the laptop is faulty, I just slap the old drive back and bring it back for repairs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2098,I think opting for a 512gb SSD is a better option than choosing 16gb ram
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2099,Both have their pros and cons.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2099,"But the good thing is whatever you did not upgrade at the point of purchase, you can upgrade later since both hard disk and RAM appears to be user upgradeable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2100,Ram will be tricker as you want to ensure dual channel for the graphics.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2100,Therefore you might need to swop both ram sticks if you need an upgrade.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2101,"When you are running VMs, you will need it......"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2102,"While this is indeed something to consider, I believe the system nowadays may not need a matched pair to run dual channel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2102,At least in 1 of the instance I noticed it was running dual channel even without a matching pair.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2102,"For me, I will go for the ram upgrade because +110 is quite a good price."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2103,"If it is me, I will just:
SSD - Boot drive"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2103,HDD - Data and etc.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2103,Like my current laptop SSD + HDD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2103,"Take note SSD have wear level, if it reach it's intended write cycle"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2103,it will fail.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2104,Erm....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2104,"Dual channel is like raid 0, double the speed but absolutely require 2 stick of ram to work together."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2104,But you are right that it doesn't require a matching pair.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2104,"If your default configuration is 8gb, it make sense to set it as dual 4gb to maximise the igp."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2104,"When you switch one of the ram stick to 8 gb, 4gb + 4gb will run as dual channel while the last 4gb will run as single channel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2104,This may affect the igp performance if it has to switch to single channel part of the time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2104,"Single channel, the speed is reduced by half."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2104,The ram speeds advertised is based on dual channel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2104,Check CPUz for your system ram speed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2105,"A 256gb will typically start to display errors at the limit of its write cycle, which is at about 350TB written data."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2105,That means 3 years to 4 years of use if you rewrite your ssd with 256gb every single day.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2105,"For a 512gb, it is double the amount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2105,Also a 512gb will be faster than a 256gb  theoretically.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2105,"To avoid ssd damage, it is recommended to reduce page file usage and use solely the ram."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2105,Don't worry about ssd outliving your systems unless you are swapping huge amount of memory every second.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2105,Servers maybe?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2106,"True, page file on SSD is bad so have to turn it off or."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2124,eh i try if i have enough time with the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2125,I think just play around and provide some general feedback will be good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2125,I actually don't think you need to do some in depth benchmarks and such.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2127,UPS delivery is fark up.....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2127,"I called UPS on thursday to ask when is the delivery, they say either Friday or Sat, ask me call them on Friday morning to confirm the schedule."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2127,I went home on Thursday to see a note from UPS saying attempted delivery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2127,"Called them to ask wtf is going on, they just say delivery man on the way so just deliver....."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2127,"So nevermind, i schedule for delivery on friday after 2 pm..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2127,"they say cannot, delivery time is 9 am to 6 pm and dependent on the route which the delivery man uses..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2127,so cannot schedule timing...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2127,but i cannot stay home the whole day just to wait for a parcel right....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2127,so CSO say ok i arrange after 7 pm for u.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2127,"So i have been home from 7 pm till now, still waiting...."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2127,And i got a feeling its not coming tonight.....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2127,haizzzz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2128,Lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2128,They just delivered the mouse to me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2129,i got the mouse and case already...waiting for the laptop only
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2130,Normally by 9 pm
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2130,"and you don't get it, most likely you won't get it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2130,Most delivery companies have sort of a cut off time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2130,There are couple of cases where I still received them at 10+ pm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2131,Actually if possible test the battery life..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2132,"ppl also quite bz le, n beside the battery life is dependent on how the person use it"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2133,I don't need a thorough test..

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2134,Ever they delivered an item at 10pm before.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2134,Only one which can schedule specific window and date in my experience is DHL.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2135,We can expect idle battery life to be less than Intel as they are still not as efficient at lower clock rates.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2135,"But for low to medium consistant usage of processor, we can expect similar battery life as Intel, minus a few percent."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2135,"You can refer to those benchmarks from e480reviews, assuming similar components are used."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2135,"However, take note a processor battery usage can be as low as 1/4 of a system, therefore the LCD panel, igp and mainboard battery usage is of importance as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2136,Lenovo mentioned that it's up to 13 hours.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2136,So without intense gaming I expect it to last at least 9 hours.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2137,I will not put too much stock into that......
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2137,Cheaper LCDs and wifi card does not translate to better power efficencies.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2137,"Based on a 45wh battery, with an expected 6 to 8 watt usage"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2137,", I think 6-7 hours usage is about right."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2137,"If you switch off wifi, read only PDFs and at low brightness, then maybe 8 to 10 hrs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2137,"On the bright side, a ""USB PD"" power bank can charge the laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2138,You should take what they market with a lot of salt.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2138,"So far, I have seen many optimistic claims, but fell far short."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2138,"Reasonably, you should see at least 6 plus hours with light usage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2138,"Intense gaming, the numbers will plunge to about an hour or 2 max."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2139,"At load, I suspect the Intel based E480/580 may experience shorter battery life as it needs to supply the dedicated GPU with additional power."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2140,erm... depends on what kind of load you are talking about.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2140,CPU load?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2140,Games?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2140,Videos Transcoding?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2140,"If doing heavy gaming or video transcoding, I doubt anybody will expect more than 2.5 hours on either the e485 amd or e480 intel with graphics, which makes the discussion on battery life irrelevant."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2140,An extra 20 mins of battery is not going to bring much value.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2140,The dedicated graphics don't kick in unless the IGP cannot handle.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2141,I wonder if this model really isn't selling well..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2141,not even a single youtube review so far..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2142,"This model E485 is not sold worldwide, only certain country have."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2142,Which shockingly SG is among them to have it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2142,Most Thinkpad user will opt for Intel than AMD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2142,Review may come like from Notebookcheck website.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2146,Hot and slow.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2146,But that is like very long long ago.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2147,"For heavy gaming, I am pretty sure it won't last for more than an hour and a half unless it throttles both CPU and GPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2147,Some laptops do that when running on battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2147,"While dedicated graphics don't kick in at idle, the GPU still needs power to allow it to switch quickly."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2147,"Also in this case, we are looking at an AMD GPU in the E480 with Intel processor."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2157,Problem boils down to the power limit set by the manufacturer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2157,"If they keep it strictly at 15W and 25Wboost, then I would expect the R7 to throttle more when it hits the limit."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,"I set the processor to 100% and it managed to get a much better score on geekbench, but still not pushing the processor 100%."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,Cinebench 15 shows that it outperforms i7 8550u by 5% on multicore and lose by 10% on single core.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,I will say it performed really well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,No thermal throttling that I can see.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,3
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,"3dMark skydiver shows a score of 800, which is very close to the dedicated mx150 GPU in most ultrabooks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,MX 150 in Ultrabooks is usually slightly throttled because of heat.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,4.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,SSD performance is really good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,The 512 GB samsung has a sequential read of 2.7GB per second and write of 2GB per second.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,4k read writes are about 10 - 20% better than the E480 review on notebookcheck.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,"However, the ssd controller temp went up to 98 degree."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,"SSD brand is a lottery, so don't expect samsung in every laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,Your mileage will vary.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,5.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,"Screen brightness is quite low and I will expect to use 50% brightness in a well lit room, in comparison to the usual 25% for my other laptops."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,The matt display is great although I can see very faint bleeding at the bottom.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,Acceptable for this price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,6
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,I managed to squeeze 7 hours out of this laptop by setting max cpu to 70% so it will not turbo boost in battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,"However, the lowest possible clock I can get it to go consistently is at 1.6ghz."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,"My settings are: Wifi on, 25% brightness, 2.5% average cpu utilization, 10% average highest cpu core utilization."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,"If you are consistently visiting javascript heavy or ad heavy webpages like hardwarezone, then expect your ""average highest cpu core utilization"" to spike and as a result, much heavier power usage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,"I will say on average, a uptime of 4 to 6 hour is very achievable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,"However, it is still poorer than a intel chip."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,I will expect intel to have an extra 20 - 30% extra runtime.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,7
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,It can be charged or run from a external USB PD powerbank.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,A 100 wh powerbank will easily give an extra 150% - 180% more battery life to you on the road.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,8
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,It is a thinkpad keyboard.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,9
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,"In conclusion, I think this laptop is a fantastic buy if you want to game occasionally or require 16 GB ram for multi tasking / development work, despite the ""subpar"" wifi."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,"In everyday usage, wifi is not expected to be a bottleneck, so it is not a factor in my review."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2174,I hope this can be of help to those considering this laptop.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2249,Thanks for the information.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2249,Looking at comparing between E485 and E585 but for some reason with the same configuration E485 is around $210 more expensive as compared to E585 due to the preconfigured Window 10 home and SSD size.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2250,"But iirc e485 is 14"" and e585 is 15"" but all configuration is almost the same selections."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2251,its down to weight vs size.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2251,if u dun mind a few hundred grams n
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2251,a bigger screen get E585
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2252,The card will changed to vegas 10 if you upgrade the CPU to Ryzen 7

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2260,right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2260,anybody bought the laptop and did some upgrade them self?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2261,$1.6-$1.9k is already Latitude 5000/Probook/Thinkpad L tier.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2261,Overpriced unless you really like the aesthetics and keyboard layout on the Envy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2262,When mine arrive i try and tell u
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2263,I see that there is an option to add in the 45w or 65w power cord.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2263,"Then over at the accessories page, there is an option to add in the 45w or 65w charger."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2263,"If I don't select any charger, does that mean I will not receive any charger at all?"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2264,"I doubt so, the accessories page gives you additional accessories such as additional power brick and more, you will still receive the power brick that comes with the laptop you ordered."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2271,Why is 2x8GB ram better than 1x 16GB ram?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2271,One more question.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2271,I know this is using AMD and xiaomi laptop using intel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2271,But how are they compared when the xiaomi one is about $1k but of coz with the crappy Chinese windows.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2272,Depends on your usage
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2272,"also i guess, for me i'm not planning on doing any gaming on my laptop so a Ryzen 5 2500U will surface."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2273,How you get $250 discount?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2273,I thought only $200 using AMD18?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2274,This is a Thinkpad
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2274,so the quality will be far better than the Xiaomi.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2274,Not to mention it is intended for.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2274,business
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2274,use
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2274,so it is made to last.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2274,2 X 8GB will enable dual channel than 1 X 16 GB which will.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2274,improve the performance slightly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2275,Thanks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2275,"Oh, should I have 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD or should I just have 512GB SSD?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2275,They will install windows in then
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2275,SSD right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2276,"With an EDU account, can get $250 anytime."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2276,I believe with SGNIGHT too can get the same discount value.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2277,Apply the code IPRICE.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2277,Someone shared this code earlier.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2277,Valid till 26th Aug I think.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2278,Thanks for your replies.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2278,"Current code ""SGNIGHT"" has $250."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2279,Anyone can verified if the hdd connector will be inside although the hdd is not chosen in the configuration?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2280,"imo, SSD much better than have HDD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2280,Skip the HDD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2281,"SGNIGHT, IPRICE and student account gives you $250"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2282,I think have...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2282,the screenhot is the internal of 485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2282,We can see the cable front bracket.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2282,Anyway Lenovo had put E480 / 485 and E580 / E585 as a group--1 with intel and the other with AMD CPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2282,"Other forums had said 580 and 480 comes with dummy HDD and HDD ribbons, so 485 and 585 should have it too."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2282,Mini review
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2283,I noticed that the order sheet does mention dummy HDD as part of the deliverable also.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2283,Sent from HUAWEI BLA-L29 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2284,"On the way from Lazada... all add in, good price for this laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2284,Looks like a number of people buying these.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2284,SAMSUNG SSD 860
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2284,"EVO 500GB Up to 550MB/sec Sequential Read, Up to 520MB/sec Sequential Write"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2284,SGD187.90
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2285,Best have two SSD and HDD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2285,SSD for OS and HDD for data.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2285,"In case if SSD fails, at least your data is on the HDD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2286,I think I ever read that the ssd has a write lifespan?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2286,"For the order, ssd can only be chosen as the 2nd hard drive while hdd is the first hard drive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2286,IBM wont be so stupid to install windows in the hdd instead of the ssd
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2286,right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2287,"well yes it has written lifespan, but they are quite long if ur laptop usage is considered low/ minimum usage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2287,Even high usage can last at minimum 5 years.for good endurance SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2287,"As for installation of OS, I doubt that they will install on HDD as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2287,So u need not to worry about it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2288,I don't even know people are still so concern about the write endurance in a SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2288,A notebook u constantly have to power it on / off.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2288,"Before the write endurance has used up, your hdd probably will die first over your SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2288,Even if it doesn't die it will have tons of sector allocation problems that provides you with extremely bad writing speed
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2288,Really lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2289,I'd even dare say more SSDs die randomly than actually dying due to maxing out its endurance
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2290,Usually OS is on SSD if not Windows 10 will crawl seriously.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2290,"Sadly SSD have lifespan, once it reach"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2290,it's write endurance than...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2290,"Need not worry, SSD won't die that quick."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2291,Good luck.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2291,Continue with HDD then.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2291,I believe those that said write endurance belongs to the group that opposed calculators from abacus era.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2291,See what have happen in today's context.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2292,At which point did I ever state to stick with HDD over SSD for OS drive?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2292,"I was pointing out that even in the small size of SSD failures, more of it is probably down to random failure than actual endurance failure,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2292,enforcing your original point that write endurance is a non-issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2292,"How often have we seen posts of outright failure, versus actual posts of
"""
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2292,yo me
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2292,"SSD's dead after 3967TBW""."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2292,Rarely it's the latter
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2293,Ok.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2293,Point taken.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2293,my bad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2294,The take away here is to have good backup habit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2295,Chill.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2295,I
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2295,"dunno, thats why I ask for advice here."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2295,Purchased a laptop here based on the advice and recommendation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2295,Thanks so much and thanks for the discount code.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2296,Is there a 13” model?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2297,Have.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2297,But other models.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2297,The offer may not be as good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2297,I am not sure also.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2297,The Lenovo website says idealpad and thinkpad has August promo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2298,Onky Lenovo has amd ah
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2299,is it easy to access the slot?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2299,if I have 512ssd that slot will empty huh
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2300,485 and 585 only the screen size difference?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2300,comex also coming hor.. hmmszzzzz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2301,based on youtube.. just unscrew and access.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2301,fairly easy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2301,"ya, that slot will come with a Dummy HDD if you only selected 1xSSD"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2302,Those PC exhibits in SG rarely have good deals 1.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2303,bros who recv E585
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2303,", mind check is there gigabit ethernet?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2303,thanks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2304,How is the throttling issue for both e4 and e5 with ryzen 5.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2304,Posted with Audeze LCD-X HardwareZone Forums app
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2305,Am I doing it right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2305,Both same config with 16gb and 512GB SSD. 585 comes out about $100 cheaper.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2306,"I just ordered, almost exactly like yours except I chose 256GB SSD, so it looks right to me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2307,concerned of the throttling and compatibility...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2308,"Pay the $2 more to get the 65W adaptor, which supports quick charging."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2309,"Its less than $1k, so ok la."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2309,Try lo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2309,I think should be fine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2310,"$16, not $2."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2310,At least for my options.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2311,"Yes, it's 16 for me too."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2312,"Would get both of them or the more expensive one if only 1 allowed, then purchase the cheaper one separately."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2312,"65W permanently at home, the marginally lighter and more packable 45W type-C to bring along when outside."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2312,It also means you don't have to unravel a charger to use at home.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2313,"i think he meant the 45W to 65W upgrade, E485 cost $2 to upgrade and E585 cost $16"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2314,"Actually, for E585, it shows $16, but when you add it it's just +$2."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2314,Think reason is coz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2314,it's the price of the add-on and not the upgrade price 45w selection
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2314,is $14
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2314,", 65w is $16"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2315,"You are right, didn notice it when i check out."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2315,More reason to upgrade to 65w unless one really need the light weight factor
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2316,"For those that hooted, when will you be getting it?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2316,Mine is still processing...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2317,"If diy put in the HDD, will void warranty by removing the back cover?"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2343,Exactly... So gotta say byebye
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2344,Such as?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2344,What r u missing?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2350,This one is older one meh?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2351,Perhaps need a refresh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2351,Posted with Audeze LCD-X HardwareZone Forums app
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2352,thx almost forget abt it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2352,haa.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2352,will the IT show promo hav better deals?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2353,Ryzen ish ky de
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2354,No idea man.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2354,You ask those regular promoters on edmw lo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2354,Might be slightly better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2354,"But I dont want the hassle of going down in the last day, squeeze with the crowd, waste time, waste petrol, pay for parking etc etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2354,"The savings, if any, not worth my time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2354,"Order online and wait for them to send to you, betterright?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2355,Don't think IT show got thinkpads?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2355,Not the edge series at least...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2356,i jus checked the benchmark of my 2013 macbook pro vs the 2018 ryden processor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2356,i see no clear winner.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2356,almost on par.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2356,but a 2013I7-4750HQ vs 2018 ryden?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2356,i was expecting this to trash my 2013 laptop but shock its almost the same performance wise?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2356,am i missing something?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2357,Mac jin satki man!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2357,"Core i5 processor can run so fast, no wonder Apple sell Macbook Pro for so expensive and don't have to upgrade for many years  to come."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2357,That may be why Apple don't refresh often because it will run faster and better than newer CPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2358,I think it's cheaper right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2358,"For example I beo HP Envy 13""."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2358,Retail is $1499.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2358,Then last day previous show was $1300.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2358,Some manage to shave another $20.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2359,Can show link?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2359,I'm shocked too
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,Many reasons.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,Mainly the comparison is between top end 2013 2Ghz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,"4C/8T Intel vs current 2Ghz or 2.2 Ghz 4C/8T AMD not sure which Ryzen you refer, but give you benefit of doubt it is not the lowest end 4C/4T model."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,Intel's IPC didn't go up much over the years from 4xxx to 7xxx.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,So performance difference is not going to be ground-breaking.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,Look instead at the TDP.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,"i7-4750 is rated at 47Watt while Ryzen 2500U/2700U is rated at 15W. Benchmark per watt, is an improvement."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,Ryzen integrated Vega graphics is also a hugh improvement over Iris Pro in i7-4750hq.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,"Whereas, if you can afford the latest, MacBook Pro 13"", it is going to have Core i7-8559U quad-core: This has a base frequency of 2.7 and Turbo Boosts up to 4.5 GHz and is rated up to 28W. Going to trash Ryzen"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,2018
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,"anyday,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,"MacBook Pro 15"""
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,i9 2.9Ghz 6
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,core/12 threads
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,"part, no need to say already."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,"But then again, we are comparing a $2k~$3k MacBook Pro with a less than $1k AMD Thinkpad laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,"Budget wise, Ryzen wins hands-down."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,ps.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,"Just looked at my MacBook Pro 13"" 2015 model."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,It's a i5 2C/4T part.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,Already cost more than $2k+ at that time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2360,How much did you pay for the i7 MacBook Pro in 2013?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2361,not just that.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2361,The OS is different as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2361,It plays a part too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2361,Try and install WinOS onto your mac.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2361,you will probably yield a different result.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2362,One real advantage of the Ryzen laptop would be the graphics part.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2362,"The Vega graphics core can play most games, but in lower settings, of course."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2363,Another user review and Huawei had a Matebook in Ryzen CPU too
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2363,but they do not sell laptop in SG
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2364,I think this thinkpad is $250 off retail?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2364,Plus the $10 RAM upgrades and 1 cent warranty upgrade
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2364,", I guess even at IT Show, might only be at most another $50 off."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2364,Not worth my time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2364,My laptop scheduled to reach 30th Aug. seems like brought forward 1 day.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2365,If you remove the $210 for the 16GB ram upg...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2365,The notebook cost extremely cheap already.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2366,I dunno why people still want to hiam this and that.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2366,Configuration like this below 1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2366,K is really tao chio already.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2366,"This set comes configured with 8GB single channel, I wonder what beast will it become with dual channels."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2367,哩個優待。。。今日或者聽日係最後一日咗。。。係咪？
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2368,How's the battery life?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2368,Sent from Xiaomi MI MAX using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2369,All in all its a good laptop as this price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2369,But to maximise its life better to get the 2700 ryzen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2370,Not really leh
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2370,Because it will throttle
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2370,Any reason why wants to get 13” vs 15”?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2370,Vice versa.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2372,depends on ur needs but if got 12 or 13 i will get most portable one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2372,if macbook pro i will get the biggest cos of the retina.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2372,this thinkpad screen not so good also.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2372,will mainly output to my 32 inch monitor if i get one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2373,In thinking of the smaller one too.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2408,How is the laptop when playing YouTube videos and gaming?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2408,I heard the HP ENVY has frequent bsods when watching YouTube and artifacts when playing games...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2409,how much is envy?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2410,if no one buy then so be it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2411,"Not sure, Ryzen version not sold in Singapore"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2411,so I don't care.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2411,"Point is, I was referring to the Ryzen ENVY and seems that the Ryzen Thinkpad may have similar issues"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2412,What issue?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2412,Can sic?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2413,just curious but why only BSODs with Youtube ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2413,BSODs are usually either hardware issue or driver issues.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2413,"Not entirely sure how Youtube can cause BSODs playback via edge, chrome, firefox etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2413,"I am not doubting you, but more to i wish to understand more."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2413,My Xiaomi laptop is experiencing some BSOD issues and it usually happens with YouTube hence my curiosity.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2413,Apologies for the out of topic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2414,The issue seems to be with the video driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2414,Found this review of the e485:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2414,"https://blog.kirides.de/post/lenovo-e485-review/lenovo-e485-review/

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2416,Lenovo reserves the right to charge you a 25% fee for any opened unit per unit and a 15% fee closed box returns per unit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2417,Thank you for your advice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2417,I will keep and use if no buyer
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2418,"iirc, 1599 for R5 at harvey norman"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2419,Hmm $600 for beauty and lower spec?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2420,How come E485
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2420,more ex than E585?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2420,My specs same as yours
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2420,and I have a 2700 processor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2420,I dont recall paying over $1k for it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2421,"He sell at $900 nett, sure got people interested to take it from him."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2421,Better than losing 15%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2421,Just my 2 cents worth.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2422,E585 suppose to be cheaper by 80-90 dollar.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2422,as always larger is always cheaper for laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2423,lol as mentioned its BNIB price non negotiable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2423,its for people who doesn't like to wait that long.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2423,Not looking to make profit here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2423,worst case scenario
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2423,i will just open the box and use it myself next month.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2424,The 512 SSD not Samsung or it is Samsung?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2424,CCB Lenovo!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2425,Use IPRICE for 250 off?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2425,Any better promo codes?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2427,"They can't wait around for just one company to ship SSDs to them, as long as they fulfil their obligation to you of M.2 SATA SSD of certain size, they done their job already."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2428,gonna wait sep promo then order
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2429,What brand & model you get?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2430,Lenovo own brand - LENSE30512GMSP34MEAT3TA.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2431,i hope the benchmark is at least decent.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2431,"Seems decent:
not rock solid speed however."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2432,The keyboard layout and trackpad is so much better than my other Lenovo laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2432,they should copy everything to all their other range of products.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2435,yea.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2435,just worried about the screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2435,that's all.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2436,the weight also CMI unless for home use.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2437,"Hi all, for those who got the laptop already, can comment on the following: - battery life in Windows for normal web surfing and office work."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2437,- any crashes or instability?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2437,=- performance in day to day usage
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2437,"I am really on the verge of buying from the forumer who has a set ready tomorrow, but just hesitating on these few aspects."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2437,To me the e485 is perfect
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2437,cos
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2437,it has usb gen 2 and power delivery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2437,Not to mention 16gb ram and 512gb ssd don't know where else to find
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2437,"My other alternative is to login with my student account and buy the e480, but a similar spec one costs 500 more"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2438,"thats why i no take 15""."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2438,"i took the 14"" <2KG."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2438,my previous notebook is 1.8KG.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2438,E485 is 1.75KG..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2438,ok leh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2438,"if you read my initial post, i was also shunned by the fact that it was 2.1KG until i saw an alternative."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2438,One of my criteria for a notebook it has to be below 1.8KG compared with my old book
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2439,"Acer is coming out with a 900gsm, 15.6 inch laptop if anyone going to light weight."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2440,"No crash and don't experience any problem so far, but cannot comment on battery as I don't really care about it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2440,"For the price, I think the compromises is good enough."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2440,Future thinkpad will go along the line of XPS look.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2440,"Hopefully, it will cost reasonably."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2441,if it is gonna be everything soldered on..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2442,I like classic thinkpad looks has distinct unique substance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2443,Thanks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2443,I decided to get it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2443,"To those wondering, I guess there is still value in getting at RRP if it can delivered immediately."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2445,The price is good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2446,I am using subpar E585 already.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2446,Everything has been installed and working well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2446,I have good experience with Lenovo laptops and ThinkPad laptops.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2446,I do recommended friends to buy Acer too.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2447,2 consecutive black dots on the right hand side and one on the top.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2447,Not sure if it's dead pixels or black dust under the screen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2448,Just warranty it
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2448,lo.nbd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2449,Is it possible to carry in service?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2450,Call/email them first.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2450,3 pixels might not be enough to be covered under their dead pixel policy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2451,My laptop just came too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2451,Battery totally flat.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2451,Thought usually have some power beforehand.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2452,Do you guys think this is dead pixel or dust under the screen ah tried wiping off but no use?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2452,First one is really annoying.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2452,Second and third not so bad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2452,I see Lenovo's dead pixel policy for ThinkPad is 3 or more.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2452,You think got hope?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2453,"Tbh, looks like dust under the screen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2453,"If you take a photo and zoom in all the way until can see subpixel, will be able to tell diff is dead pixel ="
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2453,"subpixels not lit, dust = subpixels covered by dust."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2454,Sian.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2454,Hopefully can be covered under warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2454,If not can I ask them to buy another screen for me?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2454,Lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2454,"When bringing down to service centre, need to bring what ah?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2454,Also... how long will it take?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2454,Prefer going to service centre than on-site warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2454,"Other than that, the notebook  seems fine so far."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2454,"No crashes on Youtube, which is good."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2455,"Agreed, the shape looks irregular, not a typical pixel shape."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2456,Shouldn't be flat.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2456,They disabled the battery before shipping the product.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2456,Plug in the adaptor to reactivate the battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2456,Mine behaved the same way too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2456,Plugged in and got 80% immediately.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2463,"They said especially since it's brand new, should be able to get the screen replaced for me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2463,Waiting for good news...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2464,priced lower than 1K sgd?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2464,i dont think so.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2467,Think my battery is going to last me 2 to 2.5 hours on a full charge.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2468,Seriously?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2468,The battery life really CMI leh

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2469,Should help
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2470,There is also an update for power management drivers on Lenovo website.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2470,you can run Vantage to install it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2471,The e485 is actually 1.86KG not 1.75KG.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2471,felt cheated.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2471,Morever
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2471,i don't have the sata hdd already so heavy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2472,"That's bad business sense on their part, to lie about their real laptop weight"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2473,"Thankfully we all chose ryzen, cos nothing new on this side of the fence until next year."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2473,Thunderbolt 3 and maybe an extra usb-c port aside
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2473,", I think this laptop is quite future proof in that it supports usb c gen 2 and usb c charging."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2473,That's why I got it in the end.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2473,"And since it's only 1k with 16gb ram and 512gb ssd, can resell it down the road I guess, when tb3 and usb3.1 gen 2 goes mainstream."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2473,To be honest only after seeing the links you posted I decided to buy the laptop...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2473,CuZ the swift 5 you posted doesn't even seem to support usb 3.1 gen 2 and will only come out end of the year
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2474,Not too bad too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2474,Plus the offer $100 off ram upgrade in Aug just expired.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2474,So now technically $100 more expensive for same specs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2474,Current 'Comex' offer is $100 off i7 upgrade.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2475,Sept promo isnt better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2475,I shall check other deals at comex or if black friday at lenovo us since intl warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2475,No hurry to get a laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2476,Yep.. hope my screen comes back
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2476,fine
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2476,so I can finally use it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2476,Anyone knows if the Anker powercore is able to charge this laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2477,Windows update is very draining on battery as it taxes both the CPU and storage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2477,I've experience lag on my laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2477,"not this laptop, that when there is a big update."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2484,The small 1 below the fan
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2485,Don't know why the factory provides different parts as from the information or am I seeing it wrong?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2485,"Below is the parts stated ""as built' from the website, it is stated as 2280 but on the motherboard"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2485,it's so short in the post.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2485,Smaller
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2485,"than 512MB SSD may be shorter length, because I have the 2280 size."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2485,"512MB, all in black with some emboss numbers only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2485,Info from Lenovo's website:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2485,Photo from Lenovo's website:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2486,Mine is quite fast
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2486,leh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2486,"updated to the latest Windows and deleted the useless anti virus Lenovo SSD is surely slower than Samsung, but I don't think it's that slow and don't think we can feel it so much in real life."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2486,"I don't know, but that's how I felt."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2487,I am a little bit tempted to sell the laptop off to get the Acer Swift 3 or HP Envy 13.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2487,"This is after I realised the newer models have the capability to charge via USB-C, and also have a dedicated power supply so you don't waste away a USB-C port just like that."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2487,"However, right now, the Swift 3 and Envy 13 only have Type C Gen 1 and not Gen 2 like the E485."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2487,"Also, speccing it to have a 512GB RAM on either models will be far more expensive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2487,So a little on the fence.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2487,Battery life and weight may pull me over the edge.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2487,One thing about weight though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2487,"My office laptop, until recently, was a T440, an Ultrabook."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2487,"I really loved the laptop, thought it was really light until I got my Latitude 7390 replacement"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2487,which was even lighter and wished I could have a similar one for home use.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2487,Guess what?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2487,The T440 weights 1.81kg.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2487,Pretty much the same as the E485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2488,My experience with this laptop is good after setup complete.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2488,The drivers are quite raw in terms of support only lenovo has the latest version
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2488,After drivers installed no BSOD nonsense not even on youtube chromium
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2488,it can do up to 4K on youtube just running pure on CPU raw power.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2488,"Chose win10 home version ""modded"" to win10 pro version."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2488,after optimization
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2488,super duper fast
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2488,I did a clean install
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2488,"disable CSM boot, option rom etc and the boot message"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2489,"China, really is china."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2489,Tons of variations.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2489,I have updated everything to the latest including drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2489,And removed everything that i deem unnecessary including AV.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2489,It is not Windows that i am blaming.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2489,It is Bios/cmos.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2489,In fact the read write is only comparable to a SATA SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2489,Except for big files on read.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2489,The write is either worst or similar to a Samsung EVo 850 that i owns.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2489,Iirc with my cdm benchmark.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2490,Can't expect too much for a 1k laptop tbh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2490,Even the asus
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2490,ux331 that costs 2k+ uses only a sata ssd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2490,Don't really need nvme speeds unless read/write huge files often
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2490,"anw, makes no observable diff in everyday use."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2491,Bought already just use and enjoy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2491,No need to do tests and benchmarks already.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2491,They may be different from real world usage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2492,"My own SATA SSD

NVMe SSD"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2493,I think is quite funny people getting upset over not their ideal nvme drive received.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2493,brand is not promised in the deal
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2493,If you want just go taobao to buy and add not expensive
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2494,"Nvme, sequential satki"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2494,Posted with Audeze LCD-X HardwareZone Forums app
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2495,I’m looking at envy also.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2495,"Take note it can’t charge using USB-C.
Apple is refreshing too, hence can look At the Starbucks approved laptop"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2495,Posted with Audeze LCD-X HardwareZone Forums app
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2496,The new envy ah0029tu series can charge through usb-c.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2497,"to me like not bad, fair decent lei."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2497,unless the user wants to change den change the ssd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2498,Always got user already give them good deal compared to the cheapest brand still not satisfied
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2498,For Apple stuff they won't complain about pricing but for sub 1k laptop will still complain not good enough.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2498,This laptop already covered all price segment from Ryzen 3 to Ryzen 7
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2498,but there will still be unsatisfied pple.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2499,Yup for the price... 16gb and 512gb is unheard of.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2499,Anyone did further tests on battery life?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2499,I think should be able to last 7 hours leh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2499,Once all the proper drivers and all are installed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2499,Main negative about this laptop is that the firmware and bios is a bit buggy at the moment.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2499,Hopefully these will be ironed out over time
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2500,"Around 4 hrs, I think better buy a PowerBank for this laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2500,BIOS is buggy with Windows 7
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2501,Cant enjot when the cmos loads forever.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2501,I m not trying to boot a server..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2501,though the server is much longer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2501,Hopefully it w fix by having a bios update
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2502,I never do test but mine went dead after 4hrs+
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2502,It was showing 6.5hrs initially.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2502,Half brightness applied though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2502,"To me, 4hrs+ was decent enough"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2503,I see.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2503,Think 5 hours is still ok.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2503,Anyone tried the Anker powercore to charge this laptop yet?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2504,Can this be the RAM problem?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2504,I remember to wanted to pair yours with another old RAM you had.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2505,Definitely not because the ram was removed from a functioning notebook
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2506,Maybe try removing it and try again?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2506,Might be compatability issue since both sticks might have different speeds and frequency.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2506,"Also, is your ram DDR4?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2507,wifi card changable no whitelist.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2507,Upgraded to Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4A Wireless Network Adapter 2x2 wireless ac
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2508,Whr did you purchase from?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2508,And how much?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2508,"Also, is there 2 antennas in the laptop?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2508,Sent from Samsung SM-G955F using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2509,wireless modules cheapest from taobao.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2509,different module different price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2509,price should be at most $20 SGD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2509,yes 2 antenna in the laptop refer to the backplate disassemble pic I posted earlier.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2510,...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2510,"No, no"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2510,and no.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2510,Not a ram problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2510,The last question was really... ....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2511,How long does it take to boot up?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2511,Just curious.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2511,Mine was quite fast
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2512,"Change boot to UEFI no legacy, disable CSM Module, disable option rom."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2513,will change and observe again.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2513,thanks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2514,even 1s is long to me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2514,especially it took 5s.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2514,My previous notebook 5 years old took no more than 2s to start loading the Win 10 icon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2515,Oh ok.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2515,Different expectations then
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2516,Is the antenna easy to remove?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2516,How to take it on and off ah?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2516,Thinking of upgrading to intel 2x2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2517,Very simple.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2517,Also CPU is BGA soldered to motherboard.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2517,Repasted the CPU using Shin Etsu idle temperatures drop around 5 degrees.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2518,That is not due to performance but OEM BIOS design.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2518,Lenovo BIOS does not prioritize POST speeds.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2518,I know Toshiba BIOS tune
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2518,POST speed heavily even before everyone switch to UEFI.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2519,HSF easy to remove?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2519,"5c drop sounds good, might try to re-paste as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2520,Simple means how ah?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2520,"Just renove, no need turn any screws?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2521,After remove backplate can access everything.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2521,4 screw to remove HSF.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2521,original paste job
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2521,Easily one of the easiest laptop to disassemble.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2522,Not true...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2522,ThinkPads have very short BIOS times..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2522,even those with Optimus are going at 4 second BIOS time around 2011-2012 time frame.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2522,The Intel Phoenix BIOSes ThinkPads heavily optimised for boot times.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2522,"No idea on the Ryzen side if they're on Insyde, award, ami, phoenix or what BIOS vendor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2523,4 seconds is considered slow.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2523,Toshibas won't even let you hit a Key to enter bios.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2523,They have a special button to interrupt POST or use Windows Boot to UEFI.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2523,E485 is using Phoenix BIOS
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2523,Consumer grade Ideapads boot
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2523,"fast though, they have a boot to BIOS button as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2524,If it's an optimus / enduro laptop with an additional dGPU UEFI GOP module it won't outrun an iGPU machine in post time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2525,I know it isnt.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2525,i only wan to illustrate it a cross for those who doesn't understand
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2526,does this void warranty
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2527,"Act blur, warranty longer"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2528,No it doesn't.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2529,did they jack the price up?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2530,Aug promo just ended.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2530,Now is Sept 'Comex' promo which is worse than Aug promo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2530,Sent from Samsung SM-G955F using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2531,After configuration price still the same.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2531,They just changed the default pricing page
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2532,there is a +$100 cause the ram upgrade offer has ended.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2533,$100+ for ram upg to 16GB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2534,There is an issue of the clockspeed stuck at 1.4 GHZ after suspend resume.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2535,yah wasted.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2535,any other feedback about this laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2535,"considering to pull the trigger, hope promo will be back"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2536,"I am just a casual user on windows, with most of my work done on my MBP."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2536,"For basic usage, the E585 isnt any faster than my old Asus Zenbook UX305 which I got free from Starhub."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2536,"I assumed the Asus Zenbook is just supposed to be light and look sleek and chio, compromising on performance while the E585 is supposed to be a work-horse."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2536,Thus I am a little disappointed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2536,Somehow the start-up seems slower than the Zenbook too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2536,My main issue is with the battery life.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2536,Previously I reported that battery went down about 50% with just an hour of usage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2536,"I have since followed the advice of brothers here, uninstalled McAfee, installed Vantage and the Lenovo power management apps."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2536,The battery life doesnt seem to have much improvements.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2536,I am projecting a battery life of 2.5 hours at best.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2536,Is it because the E585 consumes more power than the E485?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2537,You see the latest review
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2537,For me I skip
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2538,thinkpad with 3 years NBD warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2538,No horse run la.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2538,brightness level is ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2538,"Note, the battery is both small and requires to power an IPS screen of 15""."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2539,Can you click the battery bar and let us know what the power settings is set to?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2539,"Assuming the tdp is 15w, which throttles to max 10w after some time, and battery size is 45w, you should be getting about 4 hours at the very least ..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2540,any other wifi card recommended
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2541,Set to best battery life.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2541,I have off the Bluetooth as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2541,WiFi is on.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2542,Since Lenovo joined the.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2542,Will this be a good laptop to run linux?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2543,No idea liao.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2543,What is the clock speed in task manager?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2543,Is hwinfo able to show you the tdp usage?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2543,What are Ur usage patterns?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2544,Right now no.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2544,There is a bios bug that prevents it from installing Linux.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2544,No power management drivers also.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2544,U can Google.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,Received the Intel 9260NGW yesterday from AliExpress ~$21
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,"after new member rebate, installed and tested it out throughout the day."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,"Card is detected,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,no Wi-Fi card white-list for E485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,"However, not sure where exactly went wrong - Tried"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,2 different Intel Pro Set drivers 20.70.0 & 20.06.0 and ensured both MAIN/AUX antennas are seated properly - but I am getting.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,abysmal
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,"upload speeds
."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,Based on Speedtest.net:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,Atheros QCA9377
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,"stock, 1x1 connected @ 433Mbps - ~300Mbps down, ~240Mbps up"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,Intel 9260NGW.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,2x2 connected @
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,"866.6Mbps - ~430Mbps down, ~30Mbps"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,2 meters from router with direct line of sight.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2545,Tried 2 different routers with same result Linksys EA7500v2 & D-Link DIR868L. Full signal bars for all setups tested.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2546,If your router can only do 866Mbps must as well get 2x2 Qualcomm Atheros card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2547,Yah should have stuck with Atheros...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2547,So many problems with Intel...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2548,Could it be a faulty card?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2548,You have a desktop to test on?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2549,Rats...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2549,I am fated to be stuck with my old laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2550,Don't say never help try update
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2550,IT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2550,Admin link is driver only no wifi agent use device manager to update.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2551,I thought some guy shared a grub command line bypass.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2552,"Same issue, probably a hardware issue as what trenzterra suggested"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2553,ya there is a bypass.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2553,but battery life is very bad on linux apparently
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2554,Battery life on linux has always been very bad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2555,There is a power saving feature in kernel 4.17.2 onwards.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2555,On my old Acer laptop the battery life seems to be the same as windows 10
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2556,Whats with getting another WiFi card?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2556,The stock one no good?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2557,"Great, did everything yet still cannot solve my issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2557,Engineer came over say might be mainboard issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2557,Lenovo say they will full refund me because they cannot fix it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2557,Owned.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2558,What's the issue you're facing?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2559,Just nice can hoot laptop at comex
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2560,Refund cos bios take 5 seconds to boot?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2561,in other words u still get that laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2561,o eningeer take back?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2562,I got back my E485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2562,"The screen dust is resolved, but the new screen has some backlight bleeding, noticeable in dark environments..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2562,Anyone notice this as well?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2562,But I think I'm just gonna live with it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2562,"The keyboard right now has the issue of jumbled keystrokes, hope it is resolved soon."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2562,Battery life like not so good... still monitoring.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2562,"Currenty I just upgraded from 17.09 to 18.03, wonder if it solves things."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2562,I think idle battery drain on Ryzen is surprisingly bad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2562,Using FF also seems to increase battery drain.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2563,Same issue I'm facing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2563,I cannot work on it with that
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2563,Anyone knows how to fix it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2563,Seems to me they are aware of the issue and couldn't fix it hence the refund
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2564,Still have the notebook
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2565,This seems to be a common complaint by recent users.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2565,"Affects both Windows and Linux, which means that it's hardware-based."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2566,For Lenovo alone or?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2567,You can try flashing back to the older 1.25 BIOS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2567,Cos people only started complaining recently
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2567,so could be the new 1.27 bios.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2567,"Otherwise, there will be a 1.28 bios coming out next week that will fix it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2567,Btw think I got lucky...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2567,With Samsung 512gb nvme
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2568,Can see this thread.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2568,There is a beta 1.28 bios already that a few people have but now officially we are told to wait for the official release next week
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2569,no wonder they offer to refund me in full
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2569,"but then it sets me thinking, how soon can i recover my money so that i can go get another 1 or should i get another 1 first -"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2569,but later if they say have fix don't 1 return me
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2569,then i will have 2 notebooks?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2569,anyway noway we can have a copy of the beta bios copy?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2569,I am alittle skeptical about waiting till next week
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2569,probably they will keep delaying
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2570,"Since they agree to refund you already, maybe you try flashing back to 1.25 first?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2570,I tried asking those who managed to get the beta but all refused to share
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2571,Bios 1.32 was just released.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2571,U can see if it fixes it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2571,Changelog doesn't mention anything tho
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2572,Ok will try it over the wkend.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2573,ok.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2573,1.32 fixes everything.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2573,thanks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2573,Fast boot and fix on keyboard
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2574,Installed 1.32 on mine too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2574,"Not sure if placebo, but battery consumption seems to have improved a bit."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2574,"Sadly, after I got the screen changed, my new screen has backlight bleeding issues."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2574,Seems to be pressure related
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2574,cos
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2574,when I press around the bleeding area it goes away...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2574,"It's only apparent at high brightness, but seeing it every time during boot where max brightness is activated is annoying.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2574,haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2574,Am still thinking if I shld change to spin 5 instead.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2574,Cos now going for 1198 only and has active stylus.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2574,512gb but 8gb ram.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2574,Battery life seems better and has windows hello fingerprint reader though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2574,Slightly lighter as well and supports usb type c charging in addition to power adaptor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2574,But dunno about the 'lengendary' Acer build quality
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2575,On new laptop with extremely thin bezel disassembly is tricky business due to the thin joints etc.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2575,That is why I almost never touch the monitor assembly
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2576,"If it's pressure related, try the credit card method?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2576,Sent from Samsung SM-G955F using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2577,A bit scared to do on my own...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2577,Hahaha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2577,Maybe I go service centre
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2577,see if there is any easy fix.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2577,If not sua already
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2578,So 1.32 bios fixed everything?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2578,Any major issues standing?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2578,Was thinking of getting.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2579,none for me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2579,"Battery life a bit on the short side, laptop a bit heavy and screen quality not so good, but for an office or casual laptop it will do."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2579,Right now the drivers for graphics are very outdated so might want to consider other options if gaming
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2580,Suspend resume clock stuck at 1.4GHz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2580,Sometimes boot up also affected
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2581,Ryzen 7 2700U goes up to 80 degrees during stress test
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2581,How much Ryzen 5 2500U reach?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2582,any other good notebooks you could recommend at similar price point?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2583,Don't have.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2583,"Everything else is either more expensive, or weaker in specs, or very similar but intel/less enterprise in specs"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2583,"To understand laptop market just grab pricing list of Acer,HP, Lenovo,ASUS, Dell and compare price group then their specs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2583,I assure you this one is one of the cheapest with highest specs already
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2584,"Was looking at Acer Spin 5, 512gb but 8gb ram."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2584,Going for 1198 now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2584,Going to comex later to see if there are better pricing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2585,if good specs but many taiji also no use right...

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2585,can liao..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2585,nothing is cheap and good de....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2586,Spin 5 is nice but cant upgrade ram
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2587,I am hopeful lenovo will fix it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2587,Currently it is quite usuable for me
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2587,"Besides the stupid bugs, a few reason I like it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2587,Easy to dissemble
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2587,Enterprisy features
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2587,Nice HID devices
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2587,Good specs
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2587,Low price
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2587,Support NVM SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2587,Easy to access bios chip for offline flashing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2587,USB C Charging
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2588,No choice lor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2588,The techanic is selling hp envy13 on Carousell with 16gb and 512gb for 1351.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2588,But need to preorder
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2589,overpried imo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2589,"I have to say, HP Envy looks awesome though."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2590,BIOS 1.32 is out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2590,powercfg -duplicatescheme
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2590,e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2591,Means what?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2592,"If anyone interested, I have decided to sell my e485."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2592,If anyone is interested just let me know.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2592,16gb 512gb Samsung SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2593,Getting spin???
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2594,Ideapad 720s.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2594,Long battery and thunderbolt 3.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2594,1.5k is the going price which I think is reasonable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2594,Other options all restricted to usb 3 gen 1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2595,Spin no USB type C
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2595,quick charging
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2595,Sent from Xiaomi MI MAX using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2596,Probably use it as side laptop..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2596,Thanks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2597,I see..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2597,thanks.. don't think will suspend and resume for me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2598,1.5k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2598,that's a huge leap.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2599,Yeah it is.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2599,But I weigh the pros and cons.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2599,It has thunderbolt so don't need to worry about whiskey lake and all coming out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2599,So quite future proof ba.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2599,And probably no need wait for drivers
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2599,lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2600,Pretty good price at 1385 on the online store.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2600,Too bad no 16gb ram option tho =
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2600,EDIT: Apparently only single-channel ram too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2600,Performance is gonna be limited.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2600,PWM screen too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2601,After repasting max temperature is 76 degrees with CPUZ stress test
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2602,"Bought the intel version, so single channel ram not so bad."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2602,Not using for gaming anyway.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2602,Was quoted lowest 1508 at comex.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2602,But I went to best Denki and managed to bargain down to 1449.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2602,Some people complain that this laptop has a nosiy fan.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2602,But I find it still ok
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2603,"Been using my E585 for about a week, so far did not experience any of the issue mentioned in this thread."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2603,I bought this laptop knowing that a 45W battery driving a IPS FHD screen would not last for long so battery life to me
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2603,is ok.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2603,"1 battery last me around 4hrs of normal usage such as youtube, browser and songs running in the background without gaming."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2603,2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2603,I'm lucky to have receive Samsung SSD from pushing the power button to window login too me around 5~8s.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2603,3
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2603,i don't have any issue with my screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2603,4 Purchased a 2tb HDD and installed in my laptop without any issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2603,"5 WiFi run quite smoothly, don't know if there is any advantage from getting a 2x2 M.2 Wifi card to replace the existing card."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2603,So far that's what i could think of.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2603,Kinda inspired by some of the post above to do some repasting but getting a 3g tube of thermal paste is such a waste i feel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2603,Any thermal paste to recommend?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2604,"saw Qoo10 cheaper with the coupons, credit card and gc thrown in."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2604,doubt will get it due to soldered on sodimm slot however.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2604,330s
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2604,"however, seems more interesting."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2604,"Optane memory, 1 sodimm slot however."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2605,"I have no issue with ThinkPad E585 after using it for sometime, with updated power management firmware and the latest BIOS."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2605,"The system boot into Windows less than 5 secs and less than that when set to sleep, due to the SSD drive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2605,"My power settings are set to maximum power saving with 50 -60% screen brightness, running YouTube, web browsing, web apps, Google Office and Microsoft Office."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2605,I always have power point available
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2605,so I did not take note or care about battery life.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2605,"My specs was Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM and 512 SSD, added another Samsung Evo 860 500 SSD myself and the cost less than 1.2k is still less than HP, Ideapad or any other brands available on the market currently by at least 200 dollars or more."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2605,These more expensive ones have less than the specs of my ThinkPad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2606,Think the version listed is the dual core 7th gen processor one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2606,Anyway 720s is about to EOL so very cheap.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2606,"But I agree, specs wise,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2606,"if don't care about battery and bugs and the screen, the e485 and e585 are super value for money."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2606,But for me I already have a desktop pc.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2606,So I value portability and battery life more.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2607,Ideapad 720s review
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2608,indeed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2608,my e485 already have marks although i don't have sweaty palms.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2608,"value for money in terms of specs, yes.. material and etc... questionable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2608,really love the 16-32GB with 2 SODIMM slots + NVME and SATA SSD expansion.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2609,I wasnt too happy with my battery life.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2609,I am only expecting about 3 hours.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2609,Not sure if I should flag it as a problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2609,Startup time is also slower than expected.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2609,My old Zenbook boots faster.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2609,No dead pixels.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2609,"But are the edges of the screen display supposed to curve in slightly, like a piece of paper, especially at the corners?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2610,even my old dell boots faster considering that it is on SATA SSD only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2610,"Nope, it shouldn't mine doesn't have the display issue u mentioned."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2611,mine didn't.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2611,But the display lid is really flimsy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2611,Apply a bit of pressure and you can see the whole display change colour.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2611,Fingerprints--i guess that's because of the soft touch plastic used.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2611,But the palm rest area should get less because it uses those normal hard plastic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2611,In the end I sold it cos of battery life and portability.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2611,If portability is ok you guys may want to try getting education price and opting for the e480 or l480.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2611,Get the cheapest option for full hd and then upgrade the rest of the parts yourself.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2612,Did the new BIOS update have this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2612,Or you guys all using windows...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,"You get what you pay for, honestly."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,The ThinkPad enthusiast communities don't generally consider the E series true ThinkPads.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,"They aren't constructed in the way the higher tier ThinkPads are even the L series, which is also fully plastic."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,"Like all ThinkPads they are designed with some enterprise-class features the ThinkPad firmware, including battery controls, vPro on the Intel models, etc, ease of maintenance, upgradability, and the decent keyboard and TrackPoint, but the E series compromises on the overall build quality."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,Compare the screen hinge between the L480 which has the same double-hinge design as the T/X/A/etc series and E480:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,Spoiler!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,The E480 has the same single-hinge design as standard consumer laptops.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,Someone once said the E series are just IdeaPads dressed in a suit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,"Which is kind of true, although the current Ex80 series is significantly better than older models the E480 even has MIL-STD-810G certification, although the E485 doesn't, I suppose to save cost, but it has the same construction so you can just treat it as if it does."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,"In any case you still get the ThinkPad warranty, and especially for the current models it is still better than most consumer laptops out there."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,The A485 should be releasing soon in Singapore
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,it's already available on some other regions' web stores.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,"It seems like it'll cost maybe $200 more than the E485 for an equivalent spec, but for a much better chassis and also expandable external battery!."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,"If you care about that, but you still don't want to pay the Intel tax, then maybe it is worth waiting for."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,Otherwise you can just get the T480s.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,This has not been true for a few years now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,"Linux driver support, at least on those Linux-certified ThinkPads, is generally excellent."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,Device power management is now on par with Windows.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,"Because of that, on my albeit Intel laptop Windows 10 has never given me better battery life than Linux, simply because of all the things running in the background on W10."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,"This is only for the X1C6, which prior to the recent update did not expose the S3 state in its DSDT only S0i3, causing high sleep power drain in Linux."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,No other ThinkPad does that.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,"Linux should be able to go into S3 sleep without an issue on the E{4,5}85."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2613,"In fact the S0ix states are an Intel thing, so these AMD computers will never have that issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2614,I think e480 has a different construction than the e485/e585.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2614,"A few factors Mil-spec, lack of backlit keyboard compatibility, etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2614,point to the e485/585 sharing the same construction as the older models e475/
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2614,e470 instead.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2614,"e480 build quality was improved, though it is still nowhere near the other more premium series."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2614,"Also, I doubt A485 would be just $200 more if it was, that would be incredible value for money!."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2614,UK pricing puts the starting price at 240 pounds more than the e485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2614,Price difference is likely to be around $500.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2616,It's 1/3 more than the A485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2616,You guys sure
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2616,KPKB de. TN
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2616,no IPS  some more
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2617,IPS option will come in
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2617,around 2-3weeks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2617,for similarly specs A285 likely around 800-1000HKD more.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2617,"so it is likely the following for 2500U, difference in 2x2wifi and weight."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2617,8gb 256GB 1080p SGD1260 before shipping+taxes
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2618,Nope the e485 and e480 same service manual.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2618,Board PCB layout also similar
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2619,Likely same case material as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2619,"The case interior was stamped with ""E480"" when I opened my E485 up."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2620,Icic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2620,That's good to hear.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2620,Wonder why the e485 doesn't support backlit
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2620,kb
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2620,then
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2620,"Also, just received my e485."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2620,samsung ssd =D
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2621,The palm rest area is rough on the e485
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2621,Vs smooth touch on the e480.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2621,So there's some difference in some of the materials at least
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2622,Just got this laptop last week.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2622,I got BSOD while watching Youtube.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2622,Happened a few times already.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2622,The error is VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE ATIKMPAG.SYS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2622,I tried to download the graphics drivers from lenovo website
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2622,but it says the driver is already the latest.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2622,Any idea how to solve this problem?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2623,E585 seems to be problem free.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2623,"Heng, but those who want good and light quality should get the X series or want good quality get the T series."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2623,I get this mainly for the specs over price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2624,Yeah mine is pointing to gpu drivers issues as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2624,"Lazy to troubleshoot, waiting for them to collect it back"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2624,Latest drivers too
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2624,"I have to say, love the specs and the ability to upgrade almost everything"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2624,is a gem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2624,Plus the price..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2625,i guess AMD ryzen mobilechip has yet to be optimized by laptop manufacturers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2625,"As a die hard AMD fan, i'm sad to see the state of their mobile chip."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2625,"I guess, we got to wait for the next iteration."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2625,"ryzen 2500u is like the best of both worlds,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2625,quad core 8 threads + onboard gpu with high performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2626,"For those who have issues, can try this driver."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2627,This laptop seems buggy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2627,Sigh my hunt for a Linux laptop continues
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2628,Ryzen A485 is available on Malaysias website.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2628,It is built on T480?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2629,"Nah, E480 and E485 share the same casing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2629,Just search for the C cover assembly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2629,FRU P/N 01LW157.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2629,Notice that the E480 and E485 are listed as compatible:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2629,"I also realised today that the E480/E485, L480 and T480s all share the same keyboard FRU P/N 01YP280 etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2629,"That's pretty amazing, you're getting the same typing experience as on one of their flagship laptops"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2629,T480s.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2629,That shows how much they've improved the E series too..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2629,"And you could probably
, or buy one straight from Lenovo, and just install it if you wanted."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2629,"The listings above aren't the cheapest you could get, a lot of sellers don't list the FRU P/Ns."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2629,"I think they should be of similar build, but they're not totally identical."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2629,Honestly I'm not sure why Lenovo doesn't just combine the A series into the T/X like they've done with the E.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2630,"Nah, the backlight for the backlit keyboards doesn't work with the E485."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2631,Could be something to do with the firmware or the motherboard I guess.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2631,"But otherwise the construction is identical.
..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2631,The funny thing is that Lenovo themselves list the backlit keyboards as being compatible with the E485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2632,so are you returning it??
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2633,"probably it's like kickstarter std, not ready for prime time babey"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2634,Returned.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2634,They already processed it before the fix is out
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2634,so i have no say any longer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2635,what's your next lappy?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2635,Starbucks de?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2636,What's starbucks?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2637,Seriously hwzers $800 already a bargain still want this want that.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2637,A little bit of bug unless you die die must baremetal linux cannot virtualise also cannot wait for BIOS Updates...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2637,Next time should keep quiet about good deals and let them pay more and feel better...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2638,VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE ATIKMPAG.SYS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2638,Indicates hardware problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2638,So returning is the best option
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2639,"I got this error before, clean install never seen it after."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2639,This is just video not responding in a timely manner.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2639,"Basic troubleshooting techniques, clean install and try again check if repeatable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2639,Unless you tell me you are rich man cannot afford to spend some time troubleshooting
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2639,then you shouldn't look at this laptop in the first place
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2639,just get the most expensive one in the first place.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2639,I also happen to got e475 before this unit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2639,Some issues with the driver not until this September then can do reliable VP9 2K on Youtube.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2639,"AMD is slow on drivers, wait for it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2640,I repasted this laptop over 4 times to get a feel of it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2640,"This laptop is really so easy to dissemble, I feel I can do it anytime without much effort."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2640,Now I can be sure
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2640,"the lowest it can go during idle is 47,48 degrees."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2641,I don't know whats your problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2641,You can doesn't mean others can.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2641,To you $800 might be little but not necessarily be alot to others.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2641,"If you have nothing better to say, just stfu la."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2641,"If i could predict the future, i would not have done the refund."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2641,Dude.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,Used i5 X260 can also dig for T460 from company asset disposal
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,is around $500-600 sometimes still with some warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,"Some with WWAN antennas built in, some without."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,SIM tray is part of the motherboard assembly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,On 48WH/r battery
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,it's about real 8-10 hours battery life though dual core.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,"If you won the lottery you may get 24+48WH/r, IPS than TN panel for that price."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,If you power optimise it on battery mode sub 1.5ghz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,", it's just sub 2.5W CPU package power light/moderate use, full machine 100"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,"=+ nits, low power consumption AC8260."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,On the 96WH/r config it's around 19Hrs on those type of settings.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,Windows 10 modern shutdown/start from power button to desktop ~10 sec.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,If you just need many hours of moderate or light use unplugged its a good machine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,"No botched firmwares, normally just security fixes."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,"Not a sexy machine, GPU just for multimedia."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,AMD firmwares/drivers lack validation for ThinkPad usage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2642,The TTM is late and they have yet to ship a production driver for MUXless graphics switching Optimus which kills their share of the dGPU notebook market for vega mobile.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2643,Then buy other laptops in the first place.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2643,This is a good value for money machine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2643,Not the fastest laptop in the market machine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2644,Optimus because Intel and Nvidia are different company.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2644,"AMD owns both the CPU and GPU, different approach."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2644,And I am using this for Virtualisation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2645,And that's the reason why i buy it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2645,The problem I thought it only affects me
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2645,"so i invoke support to come over, they can't fix either and told me they will perform a refund."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2645,I never even ask for it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2645,Since i need a working notebook immediately because I tried to type notes on it and all i got was messed up notes that i couldn't even understand what I typed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2645,I don't even know it is a small issue when I can't even type properly and also need a working laptop urgently.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2645,"Btw, just to add on - when the bios is out, i managed to get it sorted out but lenovo already processed with the refund."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2646,"Conceptually, Enduro PX5.0 and Optimus are the equivalents."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2646,Muxless graphics switching.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2646,""""
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2646,"Switchable graphics"" was muxed graphics switching."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2646,They've had some sort of PX4.0/5.0 hybrid on AMD/AMD systems.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2646,But it's pretty mind boggling how they aren't working with nVidia to get those dGPUs on their notebooks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2646,Quite frankly the pcie compression through limited laptop pcie lanes on the ati driver stack is quite bad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2646,There were already telltale signs around 2012-2013 time frame when I was still touching the aboriginal eGPU
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2646,that were taking PCIe from expresscards and WiFi slots when on kepler vs gcn.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2646,"Back then, something like a GTX 660 still scaled quite well when put through optimus relative to something that's pitcairn level taking a larger haircut thanks to enduro."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2646,Point being more raw hardware/power consumption for the equivalent performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2646,The radeon mobility drivers still need a lot of work even to date.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2646,I've thought of Raven Ridge notebooks at some point but settled with a used X260 for now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2646,"Can't wait for BIOSes, drivers and workarounds though more raw hardware is nice."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2647,Already shown which gpu driver to use to resolve the crash.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2647,So now is user problem?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2648,"Curious, what laptop u getting in the end?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2649,User complain still understandable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2649,What I can't understand is why some ppl don't even own the laptop yet can keep having so much complaint...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2649,Sent from Samsung SM-G955F using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2650,Acer swift 3.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2650,Everything similar except only 1 dimm slot that is upgradable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2650,"The other 4GB ram is onboard, total 12GB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2650,"Comes with fingerprint, windows hello, kb backlite, lighter by 400grams but $200 more expensive, less 4GB ram, 2 year carry in warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2650,"No matter how i see it, the E485 is still a champ in terms of value."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2651,I see.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2651,Should wait for qoo10 coupons again.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2651,Then it may be even cheaper than e485 now with no more 16gb promo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2652,U getting another one?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2652,How many notebooks are you changing?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2653,"No, sticking with the IdeaPad 720s for the foreeseeable future."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2653,Battery life is twice that of the ThinkPad and weight almost half.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2653,"I have to say, the ThinkPad keyboard is better and seems built like a tank."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2653,Maybe will consider again next year when all the bugs are sorted out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2653,"Meanwhile, I think no point waiting for something that may never materialise."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2654,Interesting.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2654,Great purchase!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2654,I wanted the 330s actually.. but ended up with the Acer instead..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2655,Not really a user problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2655,"Issue persists with the APU drivers provided by Lenovo, which incidentally dates back to 2017 version 17.7 with no further updates."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2655,"To get the latest drivers from AMD, which are not officially sanctioned, you have to side-load, since the driver packages provided by AMD are not supported by Raven Ridge."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2656,"I am using the driver provided by lenovo, i think the BSOD results from image preparation process with the drivers"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2657,"As long as it resolve the issue, does it really matters who provide the drivers?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2658,Any good docking station to recommend for this laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2659,this model does not support.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2660,Docking station
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2660,only why no support?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2660,Even E480 and E580 can use USB-C docking station.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2661,I bought a samsung 860 evo 500gb m2 ssd
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2661,Now this ssd is not detected in bios or ssd on my e585
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2661,Updated to latest bios but still same issue
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2661,Please help
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2662,You CANNOT put in a SATA SSD into a NVMe SSD slot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2662,1 connects via a SATA Controller the other attaches to PCI-E Bus
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2663,Thanks for the reply
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2663,I think i have to sell this off
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2664,Buy a converter to SATA pin out if you want to save money
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2665,Thanks for the suggestion
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2665,Looks like the cheapest Samsung 512GB NVME is $328
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2665,I might get the adapter and convert it to sata.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2665,or sell this one and get a 1 tb ssd drive
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2666,Anyone tested E485 max battery life in hours?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2667,Approximately 4-5hrs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2667,Lesser if full brightness.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2668,I wonder is it the ryzen cpu is not power saving or thinkpad internal battery pack not sufficient.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2668,Looking for around 10hr batt life
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2669,Ryzen CPU bah.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2669,Cos
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2669,on brief web surfing it maintains around 10k to 12k
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2669,mah usage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2669,For Intel it can go down to 7 to 9k or 4k when idle Ryzen idle is about 7-8k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2669,Peak wise
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2669,I think Ryzen is more efficient tho
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2670,"If 4-5hr is an accurate estimate, then the average power consumption is like 9-11W for the 45WH/r battery."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2670,"You can interpolate with the commonly used mobilemark 2014 runtime for lenovo across their notebooks to have a good guess on the ""real"" battery life of other thinkpads."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2670,But mobilemark iirc does not account for active wifi radio usage meaning no weightage/measurement of wifi card power consumption
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2671,"To update, received a replacement card from the seller and faced the same issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2671,So it is not a problem with the physical hardware.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2671,Did another night of troubleshooting all for a $20 card!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2671,=- Noticed that issue with slow upload speeds Only cropped up when I installed updated Realtek.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2671,LAN.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2671,drivers for My G485
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2671,"either via Lenovo Vantage, or manual installation."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2671,"The 9260 worked perfectly fine, with the default Realtek LAN drivers that came with a fresh install of Windows 10 not from Recovery."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2671,Not sure where the link was though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2671,Probably going put up for sale the 2 9260 cards I have
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2672,I also bought a 9260 works fine without the intense troubleshooting of course
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2672,I
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2672,_NEVER_
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2672,install disVantage
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2673,I volunteer to absorb 1 of the AC9260 for a spare AC8260
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2673,I cover both ways postage
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2674,Interesting.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2674,Can you help check the version of your Realtek LAN drivers?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2675,"Really depend on usage, if you want that long than iPad."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2675,Even surface pro up to 5 hours but again depend on usage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2675,Unless you get a second battery or higher end business model.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2675,like T480 with option for 6 cell 72wh battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2675,But again if usage too intensive the battery time will decrease.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2676,"for e585, the rams are single channel or dual channel?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2676,do i need to change them to dual?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2677,Should be default win driver never bothered to update generic stuff like realtek nic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2677,But got the driver for 9260 from intel
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2678,You mean Single/Dual Channel or Rank
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2679,single/dual channel
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2680,Once you have 2 slots full should be dual channel
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2681,Interesting.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2681,My IdeaPad 720s that I bought after selling away the e485 had the same issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2681,Also Intel 9260 or 9265 can't remember.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2681,300mbps download and 30mbps upload.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2681,But after I updated drivers on Windows update I'm getting 400+ each direction
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2682,The lowest I ever got on the Ryzen when leaving everything off except WiFi and not doing anything was
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2682,about 7W.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2682,There's something 'wrong' with idle power consumption.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2682,Not sure what is consuming all the power.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2682,"Anyway, Carousell is selling the Aukey 30k power delivery power bank for just 69 dollars."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2682,Should be able to double battery life
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2683,Can help check the versions of both the 9260 and Realtek LAN drivers?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2683,Glad to know I'm not the only one with these issues
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2683,haha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2684,Wary of Intel compatibility already
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2685,does changing thermal paste for hsf help?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2685,i have spare arctic silver mx4.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2685,read on reddit some say lenovo did good job on paste
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2685,so change also
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2685,no diff
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2686,Tried the Qualcomm 61x4a?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2687,what is the ram speed for this model?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2687,any noticeable diff if i get a faster pair
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2688,Should be Max 2400
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2688,cos is first gen ryzen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2689,I have 2 units of lenovo e475 and e485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2689,Both are slapped on and pressed down.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2689,The e475 used a phase change paste like shin etsu while the e485 use a wetter type like dow corning.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2689,I think arctic silver is a joke thermal paste.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2689,I repasted with Shin Etsu dry phase
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2689,change thermal paste for both
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2690,Where to get this shin etsu thermal paste?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2691,Laptop sinks are normally low mounting pressure.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2691,You don't add low viscosity pastes to low mounting pressure sinks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2691,Unless you don't mind more paste replacement cycles.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2692,The paste they use can differ even though it is lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2692,usually dow corning or shin etsu
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2693,On my table
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2694,"But both are ok and the amount of paste preapplied on the sink that's pressed down, mx4 texture is too watery for laptop sink."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2695,"so for this laptop, does reapplying new thermal paste help?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2695,what paste should i get
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2696,Ask the actual owners.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2696,Just thinkpad user ssrr based on how it typically appears when preapplied on fans in cru form.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2696,Something with moderate viscosity works.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2696,"Just strike off :
-mx4"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2696,newer formula also watery
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2696,=-kryonaut
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2696,very watery before steady state or anything similar in texture
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2697,Ya this is the LAN driver with no issues.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2697,Attempting to update this driver will screw up the 9260
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2697,upload speeds.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2697,I cannot fathom how LAN drivers will affect WiFi.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2698,Same problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2698,It worked for you?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2698,"For me, the problem only disappears with the generic MS drivers for Realtek LAN 9.1.406.2015."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2699,so it means to uninstall the driver and reinstall from lenovo web site?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2700,Can also try A285 Display Drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2701,A285 and A485 are available in the Lenovo Singapore store now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2701,The price difference to E485 for an equivalent-specced model is about $100 only!!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2702,wasted no 16GB $1 upgrade.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2703,Review is out and it is disappointing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2703,Cheap
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2703,yes so there are pros and cons.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2704,"Yes, I saw that review."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2704,"They didn't test it with dual-channel memory, which actually impacts Ryzen pretty significantly."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2704,"Other than that, discounting the performance differences due to AMD instead of Intel AMD's parts are still not as power efficient as Intel, let's face it, and the same firmware keyboard and ACPI IVRS table issues as the E485"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2704,", it's pretty much identical to the T480."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2704,"It is not going to be worse than the E485, so for an extra $100-$200 you get a better construction dual hinge instead of mono, CFRP instead of PC/ABS on some parts, the external hotswappable battery, and an overall slightly slimmer and lighter body."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2704,I'm waiting for Notebookcheck's E485 review.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2705,When gen 2 come?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2706,Which one has a better battery life?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2707,somebody feedback that a485 is worse tham e485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2707,single heatpipe compared to e485 dual heat pipe.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2707,plus the screen uses pwm

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2708,version.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2708,Difference between pro and normal is lack of build in security.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2708,feature.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2709,all LCD uses PWM right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2710,Lenovo just updated the VGA drivers on  1st October.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2711,H series are high performance but rated at 45 watt.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2711,not like U series at 15 watt.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2712,"Not sure if they can 45w , being 15w also got ""issue"" liao."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2712,"As in, they need to look on the design not just jigsaw puzzle NB from the air"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2713,Some manufacturer recycle NB design based on Intel port.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2713,to AMD which doesn't work.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2728,Its not 690... 735?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2729,"Have to pay more to get better and lighter laptop, or get HP version of Ryzen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2729,Maybe that's the trade-off or else
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2729,those light laptop will have no USP.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2730,Order after 10pm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2730,Choose the Ryzen 3 2200U and customize accordingly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2730,It will be 690.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2731,Thanks for the advice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2731,I have consider it too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2731,But finally decided on the hdd
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2732,HDD will be slow and will get slower as time goes by.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2732,I don't know why it's happening on Windows whereas on the Mac and linux
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2732,it does not seems to have this problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2733,Why didn't you opt for the 65w charger?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2733,It's just +$2.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2734,Can use 2 ecoupons?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2735,It is +$16
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2736,I doubt so
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2737,Then how to get $690...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2737,"I already applied the AMD18 coupon, how to apply SGNIGHT coupon?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2738,Place your order after 10pm
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2738,and you can use the SGNIGHT coupoon
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2739,It shows as +$16 but its actually only +$2.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2740,Yup.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2740,Thanks ^_^
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2741,Understand that the battery is non-removable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2741,Did anyone try to remove it and power up the laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2742,Why would you want to do that?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2742,"If battery lifespan is a concern, you can opt to limit the percentage of full charge via Lenovo Vantage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2743,Ok.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2743,Will explore that option.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2743,Thanks ^_^
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2744,Better spend 16 dollars to get fast charging.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2748,Should have gone for 16gb for dual channel I feel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2748,Ryzen performance really quite dependent on ram.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2750,The one year old ideapad 320 AMD A9 is too slow even for youtube and school work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2750,A pain to use.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2750,no talk....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2751,Should still have gone for a larger ssd tho.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2752,The Radeon R5 should have HEVC decoding to do FHD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2752,On google chrome with R5 at most FHD depending on CPU performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2752,Below is R5 with firefox with flash plugin on FHD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2752,If you want h264 in youtube chrome you have to install.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2752,to force youtube to use H264 decoding
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2753,"My existing is a Acer Amd A4-5000, 4 GB ram."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2753,Watching youtube is no problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2753,"As for applications, it is a bit slow though."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2753,"If you want, you can cancel your order and reorder again."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2753,128 Gb for SSD is kind of small.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2753,Either you up it to 256 Gb or top it up with a 500 Gb hdd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2753,Bear in mind that the SDD will die faster than the hdd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2753,"In my desktop which uses SSD, the OS just pop up the warning a few days back that the SSD has error."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2753,"Upon using a SSD analysis tool, indeed, going to die soon."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2754,Agreed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2754,"More RAM is essential for all types of work, be it simple or complex."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2754,"However, cost is always a factor if budget is tight."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2755,There is a new AMD graphics driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2755,At least better than old driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2756,The thing is he wants to watch Full HD video on youtube and youtube forces chrome to use VP9 by default
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2756,Only the new Vega supports VP9 decoding.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2756,Older GPUs has to manually force h264 on chrome browsers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2757,"Something new to me,
Tested on the 4k youtube in 1080 HD, no issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2757,"Tested on the 8k youtube in 720 HDp60, no issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2757,"However, 8k in 1080 HDp60, it is lagging."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2757,"The question is, all the above, using H264?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2757,I am using firefox browser
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2758,Task manager Video Decode shows everything.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2758,Install chrome
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2758,Go to youtube
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2758,You see utilization in Video Decode when youtube is running then it is using Hardware Decoding.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2758,If your GPU support VP9 then it will work without you needing to install any plugin
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2758,If your GPU does not support VP9 and the CPU is weak then it will crawl when this happens install h264ify
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2758,then restart chrome and try again.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2758,If your CPU is strong you will see high cpu utilization as the CPU tries to decode VP9 in software
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2758,If you see your youtube run and lag repeatedly it is due to either network congestion or video decode congestion.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2759,"From this experience, it seems that Chrome browser is better at handling Video decoding."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2759,GPU utilization never goes above 30%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2760,I got a few 500gb old HD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2760,Anyway seem thinkpad is easy to diy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2760,Maybe I just pop in 500gb.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2761,Better than the official Lenovo one that is recently updated?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2762,Different updates entirely
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2763,"The current 1 still sucks, BSOD occasionally."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2763,I am forcing the Vega 10 driver for A285 on e485
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2764,"When selecting for tyhe E585, if i choose no HDD, then how they give me the OS since i cant unselect it?"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2764,EDIT:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2764,turns out it will auto change to 128gb ssd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2764,"In that case, might as well take 256gb ssd."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2764,"Is there space for additional sata 2.5"" for hdd?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2764,"Also, for ram, i noticed the default is 4gb,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2764,"if i change to 8gb or 4+4gb, it will -$40."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2764,All are running at 2400mhz.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2764,Like that i select 8gb at -$40 is better?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2765,"There is additional space to add on a 2.5"" drive, if you don't select it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2765,"Ssd wise, 512gb is quite worthwhile if you can get a samsung nvme lottery."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2765,256gb mostly will be lenovo brand.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2765,"For ram, do get dual channel since ryzen is highly dependent on ram."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2765,Most of us went for 16gb when the promo was $100 off ram upgrade
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2765,"aka +$10 to upgrade to 16gb ram, which is no brainer."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2765,You can get 8gb and add on another 8gb stick also.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2769,Select the ryzen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2769,3 version if it doesn't show up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2769,Looks like the promo is applied to 8gb as well

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2770,"Anyway, this shld be good for basic usage like youtube, internet and office?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2771,Ryzen 5 vs 7 not much difference only slight clock speed diff
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2771,Only ryzen 3 has no hyper threading
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2771,This spec already can fight with Intel i5/7 more than basic usage
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2772,Minor diff from Ryzen 5 to 7.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2772,"Ryzen 5 is a better buy, in my opinion."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2773,The $100 off ram is in effect by customizing from Ryzen 3 onwards.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2773,It cost $60 to upgrade from 4 Gb to 8 Gb  in Sep.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2810,Sent from Xiaomi using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2811,Carry in warranty means you have to bring your laptop to the service centre for any issues.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2811,And collect back from there as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2811,On Site warranty means the technician will go to your house and diagnose or fix the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2811,"If cant be fixed on the spot, he may bring back to service centre."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2811,But you will need to check if they will send back to your house under their costs or you go self collect.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2812,"Carry in, means your being to their service center."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2812,On site means they collect from your location.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2816,I noticed that the time from turn on and after login is even slower than my 4 years old AMD notebook.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2816,Still have no time to investigate.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2817,i have the same issue previously.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2831,Nope.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2831,They offered to take it back even when i did not ask for it citing unable to fix issues.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2832,This Mobile Vega really suck.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2832,Don't know which idi0t at AMD decide to let Vendor manage their own Ryzen Mobile SKU drivers instead of offering direct support.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2833,Has anyone test Ubuntu 18.10 on this laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2833,I heard the the new kernel supports Vega graphics and new power saving improvements.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2834,Before BIOS update has got problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2834,"I did the first released BIOS and then there is another one, and some other drivers updates from Vintage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2834,"The graphics driver is the main culprit, I agree with the conclusion of most here."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2834,They had to put this top priority if they really want to go mainstream.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2834,Issues like that will put off almost 80% consumers.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2836,Sent from Xiaomi using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2837,I believe even Nvidia don't offer direct support on their mobile graphics.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2837,"I recall trying to install a driver directly from Nvidia, and was prompted to download driver from the laptop manufacturer instead."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2837,But I believe there was a way to ignore this warning and continue with the drivers downloaded directly from Nvidia.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2837,"For AMD, I suspect this could be due to differing settings, i.e. TDP up levels, on the APU which is why they leave it to the manufacturers to deliver their own drivers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2837,"So they issue a general one to the manufacturer, and they can then tweak it according to the factory settings."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2838,"for those who are using intel 9260 wifi, does win10 auto detect drivers offline or need to manual install them?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2839,"For me, I manually installed them."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2839,"Not that hard, just run the installation file."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2840,Desktop no issue using AMD driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2840,"However NB wise, usually recommend to use driver from manufacturer."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2840,"TDP, performance, power and etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2840,NB driver usually are not that as latest as from manufacturer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2840,What to do?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2840,Unless manufacturer step up their driver updates.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2840,Been using laptop based on AMD processor +
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2840,graphic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2840,for the past 7 years.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2840,"Not prefect, if you play with laptop with AMD Dual graphics/crossfire"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2840,those can crash very frequently.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2840,Only way is to disable such feature.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2840,"Just take note on Windows 10, some driver may update itself."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2840,It may be the cause of crash/error if Win install/update themselves.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2840,than manual install.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2840,Time to time may want to check if there any update to the NB driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2841,i know how to do it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2841,just find it strange
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2841,win10 couldnt load any default drivers offline.ended up using another com to dl drivers into usb drive and install on the laptop to get wifi
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2842,AMD supports Bristol Ridge mobile APU
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2842,but Vega doesn't.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2842,AMD sucks no excuses.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2843,does it laptop support wireless display?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2843,i.e. cast to TV etc
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2844,It should.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2844,Wireless Display requires supported Operating System and WiFi Card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2844,Both should be present in the default configuration.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2844,I upgraded my WiFi Card
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2844,so it is not the default config
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2844,but it supports WiFi display.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2845,"Nice, thanks!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2845,Will be upgrading to 9260 too.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2850,think down liao
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2851,Anyone replace the NVME with Samsung 960 Evo NVME?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2852,Anyone consider the A485?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2852,"The price looks good, 8GB 512GB for $1.3k."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2852,Can zhng to the 72Wh battery
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2853,but the E485/585 also can upgrade to 515gb ssd for ~$800 tho.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2853,the extra $500 worth it not?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2854,The A-series only has one heatpipe for the processor as compared to the E series which has 2.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2854,Not really ideal for AMD Ryzen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2855,Quite close to getting the E485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2855,Can anyone confirm that USB PD powerbanks can be used to charge the E485?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2855,"If so, which are the known models to work with it?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2855,Thanks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2856,"Not recommended, just buy a separate spare battery if you need extra juice."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2857,can i add install a 2.5 inch hdd myself into the e485 without voiding the warranty?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2857,education store is selling it @ $585
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2858,Not sure whether you're trolling but isn't the battery for E485 built in?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2858,I don't think it's possible to swap batteries without opening the bottom cover.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2859,Sorry my bad A485 can swap or get a bigger battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2859,"If you want to use powerbank to charge this laptop,
you have to look for those design to charge laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2860,good question.....................
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2860,if anyone knows pls share!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2860,"i've emailed lenovo last week regarding this matter, waiting for their response."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2860,will share once they reply me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2860,lenovo 1tb hdd add-on is $110...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2860,wew
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2861,I don't think they will void.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2861,Just avoid any stickers that is covered for the warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2861,I don't owe this model but the Y530.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2861,I didn't get a 2.5 hdd as cost $110 for 1.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2861,They still send me the ribbon cable for the sata connection.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2861,"If they think it will void, I don't think they will send that cable or encourage to add in personally."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2861,"Just be extra careful, follow the hardware maintenance manual for easy locating of screws and any hidden wires."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2862,i think so also.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2862,usually the warranty will cover everything but the upgraded parts.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2862,but just wna make it in black & white
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2863,Hope to hear some good news from you!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2864,No problem at all.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2864,Just the upgraded parts will not be included
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2865,"they replied me:
then i asked about the harddisk and labor:"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2865,can upgrade so long as the upgrade doesn't spoil ur laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2866,This sounds reasonable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2866,Acer have the same warranty policy too when I enquired some time back.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2866,It is reasonable because we get to upgrade or swap parts as long as we don't damage anything while doing it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2867,Best to get a power bank that is native type C.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2867,"It should charge faster, as oppose to those that uses a Type A to Type C cable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2867,But you do have to be aware that most if not all portable power banks now won't supply sufficient power to keep up with the battery depletion of the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2867,You probably need a power supply of at least 30W sustained to see the battery level maintain or charge slowly under light usage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2868,Great to hear that.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2868,So gone are the days where they have the 'warranty void' sticker covering the screws?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2869,What u need is a PD powerbank...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2869,To be able to charge it..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2870,can try anker one.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2909,Was considering between this 2.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2909,Thanks ya!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2910,Worth it not depend on what you need the notebook for.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2910,"If it's productivity office, media consumption and internet browsing Ryzen 5 should suffice."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2910,At work I'm using a i5 with 8gb.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2911,Thanks guys!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2912,ya
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2912,i ordered the Ryzen 7 prev.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2912,"Yes, definitely worth."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2913,Thanks for the info.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2913,True to what u says.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2913,I actually need the laptop for work on data processing.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2913,😅
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2914,Thanks for the info!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2915,I have the ryzen 7 too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2915,Ryzen 5 should suffice in most use cases though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2915,Ryzen 7 is restricted due to throttling from thermal and wattage constraints.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2915,"I would say ryzen 7 may be better if you are willing to do a bit of tweaking thermal paste, etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2915,"Also, cost premium of ryzen 7 over ryzen 5 is not as large as i7 vs i5, which actually makes a decent value proposition."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2915,I'm personally still waiting on a good undervolting tool for ryzen.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2916,Wow!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2916,Thanks for the detailed info.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2916,👍🏻
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2917,Depends on what you are using it for.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2917,"Personally, I will not recommend upgrading to Ryzen 7."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2917,"As someone rightfully pointed out, these ultra low power processors, i.e. 15W, cannot maintain its clockspeed on both the CPU and GPU concurrently."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2917,Neither can it maintain the boost/ Turbo clockspeed on all cores for long too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2917,"So in theory, the specs is better on the Ryzen 7, but chances of it keeping its performance advantage over the Ryzen 5 is slim."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2918,Ryzen 5 if sustain load right ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2918,Ryzen 7 cannot sustain.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2918,Will throttle.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2919,What software to uninstall from the laptop?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2920,Mine should be reaching this Wed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2920,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2921,"If you are referring to sustain load when CPU and GPU under load, then even the Ryzen 5 should throttle."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2921,15W for both CPU and GPU is not possible to maintain at a high clockspeed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2921,"There should be a TDP up to say about 25W, but will not sustain."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2921,"In a given scenario where the cooling system is more than sufficient, you can see how the R7 performs in the below review link."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2922,Any feedback on any issue with AMD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2922,Home use should be ok but commercial use depend on what the company usage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2922,Certain software are designed to run only on Intel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2923,HI.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2923,What if we set maximum performance in windows and on AC adapter?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2923,Does it mean it will still throttle?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2923,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2924,"No, it will still throttle as it depends on facts like the cooling as well as."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2924,Laptop lifespan will be shorter since CPU is always running at full speed
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2924,thus more heat.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2924,Same applies with Intel CPU so not just AMD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2925,This will not solve the problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2925,The TDP is limited by the manufacturer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2925,"Even if you can override the limit, you likely will run into cooling limitations since these low power laptops don't come with good coolers like those gaming laptops."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2926,"To answer the question on whether does the E485E585 ""throttle"", one must first distinguish between the 2 basic types of throttling."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2926,1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2926,Thermal Throttling.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2926,2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2926,Power Throttling.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2926,The pictures shows the behaviour of the E485 under a full CPU load and b full CPU load 4c/8t + GPU load.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2926,a
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2926,b
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2926,"From observation, the E485 2700U cpu did not Thermal Throttle even when the temperature exceeds 85C."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2945,Did not choose 8+8 configuration at lenovo web is due to the price which is $110 more if i choose 8+8.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2975,Side note when updating driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2975,Enable airplane mode or disconnect any.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2977,So far is single heatpipe on e485 and dual heatpipe one e585 AFAIK.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2977,That's also another reason i ordered my e585 with ryzen 7 2700u.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2979,Everything is working fine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2979,I guess I will not be doing anything to my PC until problem occur
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2979,Hopefully nothing will happen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2979,Thanks for the advise.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2979,I have already updated the driver before I saw your advise.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2979,Everything went smooth and there were no error messages.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2979,I will take note of your advise for future updates.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2979,"For now, my driver version is 25.20.15002.58 which i guess is of the latest version."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2979,"Once again, i would like to thank the both of you for your kind support."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2979,Thank you
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2980,You should just consider if you will be bringing it out a lot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2980,"If not, then just go for the E585."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2980,No point in it being lighter if you don't need it to be mobile.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2980,"Otherwise, you can still get a E485 and connect a full sized keyboard at home."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2981,Oh my mistake.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2981,Thanks for pointing that out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2981,Guess reading too much can confuse one mind.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2981,But i guess i'm kinda used to the non centralised layout since been using a lot with 15
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2981,""" laptop with numpad."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2981,"And besides, i hate smaller screen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2981,It's like hp

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2982,Interested to get this .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2982,My uses mainly for work & web surfing .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2982,If possible would do some like gaming
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2982,Dota/LoL and
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2982,Wondering how bluestack/nox run on this maplestorym / ragnarokm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2982,I read somewhere Vega 8 ryzen and Vega 10 ryzen7 gpu performance about same right ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2982,So I believe go for
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2982,fhd screen / charger upgrade / ram 16gb is the way to go right ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2982,How about ssd .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2982,More worthwhile to buy and change yourself or just choose their upgrade .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2982,Dont need hdd .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2983,"Most here prefer the 2500u than 2700u, SSD wise best to get from."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2983,them.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2983,Anything wrong can call them for repair else if you choose.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2983,to install youself.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2983,If the SSD fails you have RMA youself which is up to your preference.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2983,"Vega 8 can handle light gaming, those title won't have issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2983,Unless title like Far Cry 5 and etc.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2983,you will need a gaming laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2984,Did you managed to get the radeon settings GUI enabled?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2992,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2993,RMB$85 excluding card charge and freight.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2993,"Overall for all the 3 items is SGD$98ish, including freight and card charge."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2993,Overall save SGD$10ish for option over 16GB ram.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2993,If you purchase just the killer 1535
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2993,i think should around SGD$22 including freight
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2994,Thanks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2994,I found it.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2995,I will try out tonight.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2995,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2996,Using the 2500u.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2996,I've just uninstalled the Lenovo display drivers Oct 2018 using DDU and force installed the latest AMD drivers 17 Dec 2018.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2996,"Compared to the Lenovo drivers, the latest AMD drivers fixed the green screen bug in VLC when using DirectX11 hardware acceleration, but broke the Miracast capability."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2996,"Now when using Miracast, the screen connection connects then immediately disconnects."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2996,Both sets of drivers indicate Miracast is supported from Dxdiag.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2996,Seems like I need to fallback on the official Lenovo drivers to be able to use Miracast.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2997,Maybe you can try the 19 december drivers from AMD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2997,they did fix a few more issues.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2998,I opened my E585 to replace with my old ssd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2998,Got to see the inside.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2998,The wifi card damn cheapo...

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2999,"Well, it's a budget lappy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2999,Just gotten my killer 1535 wifi card along with the other stuffs today.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2999,Just can't get used to to seeing such small cards
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2999,last time
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2999,wifi card is much bigger.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2999,"However my e585 still not here yet, it flew from CN to South Korea."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,2999,Guess UPS is flying around to stock up delivery cargoes on its plane.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3000,I read there is a new killer 1550 based on intel 9260ac.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3000,I wonder how good it is...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3000,I think your unit is flying the same path as mine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3000,CN Heifei->Korea->
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3000,CN Shenzhen->SG...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3000,haha...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3001,"I'll be ordering shortly, but have a few queries hope you guys can help:
1."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3001,I've selected 12GB RAM 4+8.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3001,Will this config give me dual channel?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3001,Or must they be the same size eg 4+4.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3001,2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3001,I'll be installing my retail Win10Pro over the installed Win10Home to use bitlocker via DVD iso.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3001,Will there be any problems?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3001,3
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3001,I intend to install the m2 ssd myself to save ~$50.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3001,"Pls help confirm this is compatible as I'm unfamiliar with m2 format:
TIA"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3002,1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3002,"Prefer same size 4 + 4 or 8 + 8.
2"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3002,Download Win 10 and create a USB installation thumbdrive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3002,Cuz DVD iso usually are outdated build and you may have to.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3002,update it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3002,3
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3002,Rather spend more $ and configure one with SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3002,"If you want to save $ than get 4 + 4 ram, SSD get 128GB will do."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3002,Have a external HDD to backup your files and etc.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3003,1 4+4 is -$40
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3003,but seems inadequate esp after 2 GB is used for vram.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3003,8+8 is +$70 but too much and increases cost further.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3003,So I thought 4+8 at
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3003,+
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3003,$10 is just nice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3003,2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3003,"ok thanks, will do that."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3003,good to know
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3003,it will not cause problems.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3003,3
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3003,lenovo charges $140 for 256gb m2 ssd
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3003,so I can save $50 if I install myself this guy
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3003,but I need help to confirm this
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3003,is compatible pls:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3004,My suggestion for the ssd is to stick to more popular brand.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3004,I just swap in my old Samsung 850 Evo with no issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3004,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3005,"The 2.5"" slot will be used by the lenovo 1TB hdd for general storage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3005,I'll use the m2 slot for ssd as boot drive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3005,"So just need to confirm this is compatible before I order or another better brand if I can find good price, so far I think plextor reviews seem ok:"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3005,Thanks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3006,try get the popular brand.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3006,if not later compatibility issues than also waste money.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3006,Just spend abit more for less hassle.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3006,up to you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3006,"Unless someone else is using the same brand and same ssd, not otherwise cannot be sure that it will work."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,"Even if compatible, Plextor are not well known SSD brand and the speed can be rather slow than brand like Samsung."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,Still recommend you to just configure
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,It with SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,Expensive
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,yes
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,but if you want speed than usually bundle one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,Not to mention for NVME SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,you need the driver so it can perform properly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,NVME driver are not like SATA driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,"If you buy together, the driver is provided within the driver page."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,Not sure about Plextor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,"Samsung, Sandisk I have used before so they are fast and reliable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,Alternative is Samsung 860 Evo M.2 at $89.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,But cheaper SSD usually are just average speed since they do not run on NVME.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,NVME cost more that is why it is near $200.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,"Up to you, if you want to save on SSD than those running on SATA."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3007,For Speed NVME SSD is the best choice but way expensive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3008,"I see, thanks all."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3008,Didn't know m2 ssd need special drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3008,That could complicate things.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3008,"Also just realised I can in-place upgrade pre-installed win10home to win10pro by simply supplying the pro key, which should make things easier."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3009,"Just to add on, the cheapo wifi only support up to 433.3mbps only."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3031,"question, how do i reformat windows for clean install?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3031,plan is to swap out my 1TB hdd with my 512 850 evo SSD SATA.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3031,got any guides?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,Great value choice!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,Normally fresh install is really dependent on individual style.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,"Anyway lenovo boot default will read usb disk b4 os disk, so you can try this sequence."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,Create your win10 installation usb.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,=- this you can just go microsoft web for media creation tool.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,"Note that last i created is having many problems as i wanted install win 10 pro, in the end you will need to change a file in the usb disk which will let you choose the edition."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,You can find this info readily online.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,"Prepare the drivers, lenovo programs if you want to, especially the hotkey and power settings."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,=- for drivers is up to you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,You can either find individual online or just use lenovo drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,"=- however, radeon drivers I highly recommend you to download from amd and force install."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,3
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,Install ur samsung evo 850 to the lappy by replacing with the sata hdd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,4
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,Just insert the win 10 usb b4 powering up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,5
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,Installing windows.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,=- wipe all partition and format.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,"- some say no need to format, just wipe all partition, but it's my style of doing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,6.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,"After windows setup, install the drivers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,"- well, last time i used to use this sequence of installing the drivers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,"Chipset, graphics, monitor/lcd, lan, wifi/bluetooth, sound, keyboard/mouse."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,- but now i don't think it matters anymore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,Just install as your wish.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,"=- remember, radeon vega driver Need to force install."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,Remember to install ccc2_install.exe after that for radeon control app.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,7
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,Install laptop essentials apps.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,"- like power management, trackpoint,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,trackpad
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,- actually they are drivers!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,8
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,Disable Windows update driver installation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,=- you will Need this to prevent Windows meddling with radeon drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,9
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,Lastly install ur own apps and update Windows.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,Hopefully i don't sound long winded here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,Cheers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,P.S.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3032,"by saying usb disk at the starting part, i meant it is usb thumbdrive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,Alright I have bought a 8GB ram from carousell.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,It's a SK hynix ddr4 2666mhz.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,"According to owner, he took out from a lenovo sff pc"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,coincidentally it's becoz of this
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,i bought it and price was somehow right for me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,My factory set ram is samsung ddr 2400mhz anyway.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,"Install the 8gb ram, boot up without problem, memtest no error."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,Sweet!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,On dual channel now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,"Cinebench a bit, 44.xx fps and 635 cb."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,"Not bad, was very pleased with it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,Played fortnite
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,"i'm a noob, don't ask me add u on 1280x720 medium settings, not bad!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,"Fps max near the 70s,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,avg
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,it stick on 50s to 60s.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,Compare to my acer
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,"aspire 5 fx9800p with dgpu rx540, which plays at 1280x720 low settings, it a big improvement for me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,But well many things are different between tbe 2 lappies though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,"My lenovo e585 is 16gb dual channel, newer processor but apu only ryzen 7 2700u, pci-e nvme ssd lenovo oem."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,"While acer aspire 5 is 8gb single channel, no 2nd slot, fx9800p, rx540 2gb dgpu and samsung evo 850 sata ssd."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,"I think if acer had dual channel, i guess likely will be a draw."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,Btw both is on the latest amd drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3033,"But whatever it is, i'm super happy, pleased, enjoying this lenovo e585!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3034,"Oh ya and one more things to add on, lenovo bios vram is set as 256mb by right will adjust up auto if needed,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3034,playing fortnite certainly have some impact on the graphics displayed see youtube video on acer swift 3 b4 acer updated the bios to force vram 1gb.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3034,Hopefully lenovo will release new bios to fix that no options to change vram settings.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3034,"And fyi, current bios 1.46 is on agesa 1.0.0.4 not sure previous bios already on it or not."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3034,Just hope as days goes by this lenovo gem will get polished up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3034,Cheers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3035,The shared VRAM the system will allocate accordingly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3035,"Actually don't need to increase, same with Intel UHD graphics."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3036,Hi guys.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3036,Is the default wifi card always one bar even when in the same room as router?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3036,I have not gotten my E585 set yet
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3036,and  am a bit cost conscious and avoiding buying wifi card
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3037,curious of this too.. also can share the taobao/aliexpress wifi card link for $20 bucks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3038,"Hi, you don't have to worry if the router is in the same room."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3038,For my case I only tested a few mins and my router is in the living room.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3038,"Just that was surprised that my acer Intel wifi card though, originally with set have full bar connection whereas the lenovo default wifi card is 1 bar."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3038,Maybe need to do settings.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3038,Cheers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3038,Edit: both laptop is on at the same time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3039,"Just search for it. """
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3039,"Killer 1535"" or ""Intel 9260""."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3039,Killer one is still based on qualcomm atheros but is 2x2.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3040,btw was quite surprised that the e585 advertised as up to 8.5hrs..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3040,4hrs
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3040,like cheating sia..

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3042,I'm gonna use 2nd piece for my son's acer e5-473
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3042,g hope it works.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3043,I cant seem to locate the proper video drivers at amd site.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3043,The chip/board selection doesn't include ryzen 5 2500u with vega 8.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3043,I also cant find a link to dload generic Radeon Software Adrenalin.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3043,Can someone pls help.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3044,Well you can just select processor with graphic and select the ryzen ones.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3044,"Typically it is somewhat ""universal"" since most of the time the link will point to download the overall new drivers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3044,You even and try selecting graphics.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3044,anyway for link as per follows:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3044,Latest Beta:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3044,Latest Stable:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3044,"FYI, i'm using the latest beta."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3044,Do note you have to force install the driver on vega.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3044,"To install the Radeon Control Center, just go to the extract directory and search for ccc2_install.exe"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3044,Cheers
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3045,Got it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3045,Thanks alot bro
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3046,"Yes I do know it will allocate accordingly, but some games are not ""smart"" on this."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3046,They will stick with the default min allocated which is 256MB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3046,"Fortnite is one of them, not sure if it's fixed by Epic, but during my game I do notice the graphic rendered is a bit strange on it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3046,But still good playing on it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3046,There's a video on Acer Swift 3 on ryzen on playing fortnite when the bios is default min allocated 256mb and another updated video with updated bios forced allocate 1GB as min allocated.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3046,You can check on it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3047,"Well, all manufacturer's is like this, overly exaggerating batt life."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3047,Even mobile phone also have this exaggeration.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3047,"But ok la, I'm used to this kind of battery life since I don't really use much on battery."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3047,"Max only use 15 to 30mins on batt each time, and 4 to 5 times if so."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3048,"Ya, his configuration is a very good deal."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3048,I configured b4 with 16GB ram and NVMe 512GB without SATA HDD though is cost $1077 with sgnight code.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3048,After which I change it 8GB single piece
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3048,"and it cost $967, which i used the $110 savings to buy wifi card and 8 GB ram."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3048,But heck should be have just configured it to 16GB 8+8 to save the hassle of the rams on my case
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3048,lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3048,Anyway it seems like now
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3048,today it's more expensive by $100 to configure similar configuration.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3048,Guess the -$100 ram upgrade is no more.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3049,It seems that the Samsung data migration software messed up my partitions.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3049,I can't get into uefi now.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3052,no issues with andorid phone or chromebook..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3052,the default one really that bad
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3052,ah.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3052,edit:

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3054,btw saw the wifi card got 1 & 2 with wires
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3054,i assume being soldered on it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3054,or its just like unpluging
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3055,How you guys update bios?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3055,using the lenovo vantage?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3056,probably at lowest settings?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3056,hahah usually such low prices cannot expect much.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3056,i do wish they actually just remove the HDD compartment and increase the batt size.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3056,would be perfect already.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3057,"Its sort of ""universal"" just take the vega options windows 10 64bit."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3058,So is fortnite issue or lenovo?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3059,Those 2 wires are antennas.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3059,Can just unplug and plug onto new card.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3060,the polarity.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3060,Wrong placement the WIFI won't work properly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3060,"Be gentle when unplugging it, just gently lift the wire will do."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3061,"Well it's more likely pointing game software issue since software by right should ""know"" vram on apu."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3061,Some say it's AMD issue due to drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3061,Others say it's Lenovo issue
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3061,coz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3061,they like more bios control over this.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3061,Overall it take 2 hands to clap.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3062,Thanks bro very helpful...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3063,Anyone self installed SSD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3063,can share some pointers?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3064,this is based on e580 which should be the same as e585..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3064,gonna refer to this when my 585 comes too
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3065,I can tell you that more than 90% of laptop manufacturers always quote battery life that only they can achieve.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3065,At least I know only Apple is very close to quoting a close enough battery life so far.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3065,"Anyway, battery life is very subjective to usage patterns from person to person."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3065,"To you it may be 4 hours, to some may stretch it to 5 hours or less than what you are getting."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3066,Yeah.. I think 880 for a budget gaming machine is really not bad
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3066,lol..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3066,"I am amd fan boy, good to have my laptop and desktop in team amd"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3067,"Anyway for those who are interested in try this
."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3067,"According to a post in
, it normal installs without much issue, meaning no need force installed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3067,"FYI, this Radeon V1000 is embedded series with Ryzen of coz."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3067,"Driver version will be a bit strange 18.40.12, which is released on 19th Dec 2019."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3067,It's the same time release of the newst beta drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3067,However this driver seems to bring back the native resolution bugs not sure what is that.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3067,I will try it soon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3068,"OK, I have test install the drivers from V1000."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3068,"I uninstall AMD drivers using DDU in safe mode, restarted and boot into windows normally."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3068,637 cb and 43.xx fps.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3068,"Tested some videos normal videos not 4k, looks ok."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3068,Will run on this driver a few days to test out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3068,Sidenote
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3068,": It seems the system ran a bit faster and smoother, i guess it installed the ""chipset"" drivers as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3069,Is not + or -.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3069,Is 2 antenna
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3069,some pc has 3.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3069,Is main antenna/secondary antenna.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3086,Or just the screen go blank for second when opening YouTube vids
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3086,.. doesn't happen all the time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3086,Could be chrome itself though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3087,"So far no, did not encounter it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3087,I'm using chrome as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3088,so got feel that the system ran a bit faster??
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3088,so far I still feel it ran faster than previous.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3089,I think he meant for the older generation of thinkpad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3089,older generation have whitelist.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3089,"so far from what I have read, seems like all the newer thinkpad doesn't have bios whitelist anymore."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3089,I could be wrong.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3090,"Anyway, there's a new BIOS update for E585."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3091,hmm funny..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3091,they shipped out my bag and laser mouse first..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3091,laptop usually in another shipment?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3091,lol doesnt make any sense right>?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3092,think might have to give this a go.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3092,*
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3092,Update*
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3092,Gave the v1000 drivers
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3092,a go
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3092,=-uninstall old drivers via ddu in safemode and restart
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3092,=-install
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3092,the v1000 with express install function.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3092,Easy installation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3092,Doesn't seem to fix the youtube video issue though
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3092,", the screen just go blank for a second, only happens sometimes when switching videos, lesser than before after installing this v1000 though."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3092,Did a simple game test.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3092,Ran the popular fortnite.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3092,"Full HD, medium settings, avg around 30 to 40 fps."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3092,"The game doesn't look pretty though and during the parachute portions, it certainly lags."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3092,overall seems snappy for task that is not too intensive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3093,come from different places i guess.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3093,its normal.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3093,bag and mouse always arrive first.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3094,I did not managed to benchmark the old driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3094,"With the v1000, I can get 39 fps with my Vega 8."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3094,Gut feel is the video is smoother.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3094,Going to get my ac9260 later.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3094,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3095,Anybody here using the stock wifi card?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3095,I am a bit cost conscious and trying not to spend additional on after market card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3096,Got my ac9260.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3096,Somehow the pnp did not kick off.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3096,I manually installed the intel driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3096,Then BSOD!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3096,"After restart, somehow it starts working."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3096,I tried the killer 1550 driver set
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3096,but it said no compatible hardware.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3096,Pretty strange.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3097,The Lenovo Vantage did not pick up this...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3098,go to lenovo support website to get it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3099,I'm using stock on e485
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3099,and it seems fine so far.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3099,What would like to know about it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3099,Any specific usage?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3101,The stock card is pretty ok depending on your setup.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3101,Found that the AC9260 performed slightly worst than the stock card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3101,The speed should be doubled but the bottleneck waa my internet speed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3101,I am on just  200mbps.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3103,Hi.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3103,Tq.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3103,"I am a casual user and therefore, the higher throughput of a better wifi card is not important to me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3103,My only consideration is that signal strength as indicated by number of wifi barsshould be normal as I move around a house.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3104,Think e485 also got the same bios update.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3105,You should go safe mode and uninstall with ddu.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3105,"So far after I clean install, the green screen issues seems gone."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3105,Only encounter occasional blank refresh on YT videos.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3106,It's average at best.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3106,Definitely not gonna win range awards.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3108,"Yes, E485 have the same version of bios released for it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3108,"However b4 that, there's also a v1.47 for e485"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3108,only which I think fix only one simple non critical stuffs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3109,"Ya, I think i gotten it as well now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3109,"it will blank almost the whole screen while switching videos, but rarely."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3109,"The blank screen only 1-2 sec, so it doesn't bother me much."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3110,Hope they fix it in later drivers.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3114,Was thinking of 12gb ram.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,Basically you need the drivers to work properly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,Take note try not to use drivers from either MS Windows update.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,and manufacturer or even third party.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,"Desktop is fine but laptop wise, it may affect the performance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,and not to mention battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,Disconnect internet or unplug LAN during Windows installation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,Graphic card driver seems the common concern here as it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,affect the NB stability.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,"Try to use driver from Lenovo, if really buggy than use those."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,from AMD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,"Third party driver for use with AMD Ryzen APU, Vega 8/10."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,like firepro/embedded series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,"It may work but take note, even if it can increase performance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,"The power consumption could be higher, just notice the fan noise."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,"If it is really loud, opt to revert to manufacturer driver."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,Cuz manufacturer driver there are some customization as well as
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,set what TDP it is running at.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,FYI
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,I use AMD notebook since AMD Turion/Phenom II days
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,so I been.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,playing with AMD way early than most.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,Since for most notebook they would use Intel than AMD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3115,Ryzen NB have been the best in my opinion so far.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3116,Noted thanks alot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3116,One thing
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3116,I'm unclear:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3116,do we still need the realtek wlan and bluetooth drivers if we switch out the atheros for ac9260?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3116,i.e. are realtek's drivers
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3116,some kind of base drivers that the wifi card's drivers require?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3117,"For my unit, the stock card was Qualcomm, not realtek."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3117,I believe there are certain CTO that may be able to configure to realtek wlan etc.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3117,"If you switch out to other brand wlan, then you need the new brand wlan and BT drivers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3118,"Depend, some WiFi card are combo card with BT."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3118,But for what I see you need both BT and Wi-Fi driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3118,"Depend on what they ship, if it is Realtek than use Realtek driver."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3118,If Qualcomn than use the appropriate driver for it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3119,"Ok I get it now, just pick a set of wlan+BT drivers depending on your wifi card brand."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3119,Lenovo provided realtek and qualcomm cos
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3119,they must have shipped with either of those brands' cards.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3120,"Yes, need not worry."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3120,Once you receive just check under device manager.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3120,In doubt can ask here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3121,"Anyway, there's a driver update for AMD by lenovo released on 27th Dec 2018."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3121,Go to lenovo support page for more info

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3128,25 December for the driver itself?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3128,It solves the blank screen issue?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3128,Hope it works.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3128,*
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3128,update* tried the latest driver from lenovo for the gpu.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3133,Please do not get me wrong.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3133,I do appreciate your effort in trying to inform us when there is an update.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3133,I am just curious as to
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3133,how do you know of updates.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3133,I thought you have some notification or something that will inform you that there is an update and
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3133,that is why I would like to know or enable it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3133,"Since you have mentioned that you do get info from reddit and sometimes check on it, I guess I have to be hardworking like you to look for updates on my own."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3134,Thanks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3134,No stickers will help.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3134,As some laptops put the stickers on a screw so it will be obvious if it has been opened up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3135,Can I get an advice for my overall learning?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3135,Can I confirm that most users who order a HDD with their E585 and then immediately swap it out to their own SATA SSD is for the following reason:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3135,A
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3135,they need a HDD for other usages and it is cheaper to get it as part of E585 bundle
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3135,Thanks in advance..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3135,"for my config, I ordered a HDD = blank so that I can put a SATA SSD into the empty cavity."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3136,It depends on your setup.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3136,1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3136,The bundle hdd is typically slightly cheaper than open market.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3136,But we are talking about just a few dollars difference.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3136,Data in hdd are easier to recover.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3136,2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3136,I have a 500gb ssd from my old notebook to recycle.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3136,Hence I do not need those smaller ssd from Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3136,3
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3136,You still need a storage for Lenovo to put the bundle OS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3136,Why not pick the most value for money?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3140,"So My Acer now is back to SSD and passed to my sis, niece and bro-in-law for usage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3140,I may put in a normal HDD into the SATA in the near future just for data storage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3140,"If i feel rich enough, then I will get SATA SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3140,For your case if your NVME SSD is 500 GB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3140,I think it is enough for you to store most of the things.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3140,"If 256GB, it may enough for now, but as time goes on it will choke up eventually with all updates and proggies you install."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3140,EDIT:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3140,"Oh, saw your later post."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3140,Yes that will be a better choice in the later part since mechanical HDD is always cheaper.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3141,I am still on v1000.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3142,tend to wear out faster than HDD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3142,128GB should be bare minimum since OS will take about 30GB or so.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3142,"For storage just store them into a normal HDD, slow yes"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3142,but bigger space and less expensive than SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3142,"Games, videos and etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3142,"best to put on the HDD, in case if SSD
fails or wear out."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3142,At least your files on the HDD so you can.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3142,retrieve them easily.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3142,Take note SSD for both E485 and E585 are NVME type thus.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3142,much expensive than normal SATA SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3142,If you want cheaper SSD than get a normal HDD with the laptop than.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3146,"256GB Solid State Drive M.2 2280 NVMe, Opal 2.0."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3146,"512GB Solid State Drive M.2 2280 PCIe,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3146,Opal 2.0.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3146,"Guys, any idea why the PCIe / NVMe description is different among the 3 choices from Lenevo?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3146,Does it mean that the 512GB option does not run on NVMe protocol?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3146,And the 256GB option is on mSATA?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3147,V1000 drivers seems better to me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3148,V1000 drivers seems better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3149,Would suggest wait for ces and see what they release.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3150,If you can wait than it would be 3000 series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3150,But doubt the pricing for the new chips be that as low like current.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3150,Release date could be mid of 2019
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3150,so can be a long wait usually.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3150,for new chips here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3151,"Ya precisely, I guess it will be a waiting time between Carrizo and Bristol Ridge likely."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3152,That era not worth waiting.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3152,"Played with those lappy before, CPU really CMI but"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3152,the IGP. is the only better part of it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3152,Anyway next week than we know what AMD have.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3152,"So far no news about the H series,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3152,yes there is H series
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3152,but.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3152,I doubt any manufacturer want to use it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3153,"Ya, got my Acer bristol ridge during that era, which acer make it worst by releasing single channel model in Singapore."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3153,"H Series will land on desktop replacement model likely those gigantic 17.3"" like asus rog lappy, if it releases for it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3154,"When not on ac adapter, the screen tends to flicker."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3154,Anyone having same observation?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3154,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3155,yep same thing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3155,not sure how to fix it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3156,Lenovo list this notebook as a gaming machine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3156,"If I buy the R7 config, do you think it can do light gaming."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3156,For example my Gemini CPU cannot play Gear of War 4.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3156,Would R7 on this machine able to play it with 8gb RAM?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3157,I noticed it after upgraded to v1000 driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3157,Not sure whether causes by battery optimization mode too.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3158,Are you talking about a different laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3159,Maybe..haven't tried.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3160,Thanks for the feedback.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3160,I was referring to Lenovo E585 with AMD Ryzen 7 processor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3161,I am not sure.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3161,I was a bit baffled by this too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3161,I got the 512 SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3161,"even though I wasn't clear on this point I assumed that if the connector was PCIe, the protocol would always be NVME coZ"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3161,I am not aware of any manufacturer that uses any other protocol with PCIe.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3162,Cuz there is AMD Radeon R7 series also.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3165,Hi .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3165,Is your ram 1x8 or 2x4?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3165,Just taking a poll.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3166,1 x 8gb ram.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3170,TQ.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3170,Good info..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3170,One open slot for future use.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3170,For me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3170,My budget is very very tight..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3170,So I occupied both slots as I know my tight budget is already maxed ;
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3171,"Mine doesn't seems to flicker, on battery now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3171,"Testing with 100%, 50% and my usual 25% brightness."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3171,Anyway did I did update the LCD drivers via Lenovo drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3171,Later part I updated via Device Manager to search for updated drivers online
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3171,and it installed a newer one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3171,So maybe you guys can try.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3172,Did not find any newer driver for panel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3172,My brightness is on 70%.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3174,Need safe mode?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3179,Intend to buy one to use it for OS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3179,Is the windows key burnt into the MB sorry not so sure how to say it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3179,Meaning I simply use a USB Thumbdrive to install windows to the SSD and then recover the windows keys.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3179,Or I have to clone the HDD into the new SSD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3180,"Laptop/Desktop starting from Win 8 era, the CD key is embedded."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3180,into BIOS so need not key the CD key.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3180,However if you have other version like pro than you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3180,need to activate the CD key after installation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3180,Create a USB thumbdrive installation and install from fresh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3180,Fresh OS will give you a much smoother and faster OS than
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3180,the pre-build OS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3181,Anyway it's called monitor inf in lenovo terms.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3181,At support web you can find it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3181,If not just try in device manager and let it update via online.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3181,It's still lenovo
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3181,but version is higher then the one listed in lenovo support web.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3182,I think it will hang there for a long while.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3183,I am on 6.10.0.0.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3183,The Lenovo website version was older than mine.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3184,EDIT:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3184,Other feedback
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3184,Overall looks really nice and sturdy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3184,"Love the aluminium top and other little touches like the lighted red dot, lighted power, esc, caps lock and numlock buttons."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3184,"Also, easy enough to open for upgrades."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3184,Don't fancy the trackpoint and idiotic location of Fn key used Bios to swap with Ctrl key but have to inform EVERYONE who may use my laptop and hope they can remember this oddity
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3184,"Did a fresh install to get win10pro on the cheap, installed whatever was needed from lenovo support site but Apps and Features"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3185,By default
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3185,it seems not able to choose alternate Wifi card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3185,"If want the Realtek one, can source for it but take note it should be for Lenovo Thinkpad."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3185,Or get from local service center but can be pricey.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3186,"Yours might be limited by router, my E585 changed to intel 9260 can reach 420 down & 310 up on 5GHz."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3221,No uefi?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3222,blur about uefi..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3223,UEFI is expected to eventually replace BIOS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3223,"Like BIOS, UEFI is installed at the time of manufacturing and is the first program that runs when a computer is turned on."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3223,"It checks to see what hardware components the computing device has, wakes the components up and hands them over to the operating system."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3223,I think the vendor stores the hardware diagnostic program in this UEFI partition.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3224,Free to move EFI and Recovery partitions to new OS drive from old drive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3224,Windows will now boot fine independently of old drive now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3224,"Last optional bit to do is let windows know you only have 1 OS, so google for easy steps to remedy this if you like."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3231,cross fingers though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3232,"Thanks Sandman, works perfectly after editing the registry as instructed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3233,Got my Intel AC9260 Wifi card today.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3233,Replaced my stock Atheros QCA9377 wifi card and reinstalled my Intel wifi & bluetooth drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3233,"Works like a charm for me, big bump in speed!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3233,Couldn't be any happier!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3234,I'm using it with Miracast.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3234,Use only the Lenovo drivers or the V1000 drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3234,"If you force install the general AMD Ryzen drivers, Miracast has problems."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3235,but these drivers have other issues too yes?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3235,"like green screen video, youtube not working, etc"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3236,Amd announced it will have Radeon drivers for mobile starting next month.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3236,Good news!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3237,"Check with u guys, if i bought with both 1TB HDD and 256GB SSD, the Windows OS will install on which drive?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3238,OS should always be on the fastest drive available.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3238,Because it is the drive the machine interacts most frequently.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3238,In your case it is the 256gb SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3239,"Ok, thanks for the info."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3240,hmm my only complain is the anti glare..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3240,hate it..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3240,maybe i am pro glossy screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3240,if not so far so good
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3240,.. fast!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3240,perhaps i am bias AMD fan
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3240,.. feels good to own another ryzen haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3241,I am opposite.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3241,Never like those glossy screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3241,Too reflective.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3241,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3242,Any good deals for SSD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3242,looking for a 512gb ssd that is compatible with E485
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3242,but I am not sure which one is compatible
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3243,"Any dude, any"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3244,Same.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3244,If i buy 1 with glossy monitor i will definitely stick a matte one over it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3244,I dont want to look at myself while working on it
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3245,I believe Samsung should be OK.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3245,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3246,"Hi guys, I purchased an e485 with ryzen 3 2200u, I only need to use the laptop for excel/macros and accounting programs, I saw the question posted about ryzen 3 being duo core, am I"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3246,*
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3246,*
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3246,*
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3246,*ed?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3246,Also what wifi card should I buy and where can I buy them?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3247,Don't worry Ryzen 3 for your usage is more than sufficient.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3247,Yes it is dual core APU
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3247,but the graphic part can trash Intel UHD easily.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3247,If you are not tech savvy than just use the included Wifi.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3247,Cuz not all Wifi card can work on this laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3248,Just received mine one hour ago...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3248,Was surprised UPS called my mobile 30 min before arrival....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3248,Normally they bo chap de
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3249,It will be installed on the first drive on the order page.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3250,"Wow, that's"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3250,"dun really make sense, installing OS on the slower hdd,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3250,"guess i will skip the hdd, thanks for the info..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3251,Good job!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3251,I ordered one 2500U for a mate and got Linux Mint installed on a self-installed m.2 nvme drive!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3251,This is easily the best buy of the year!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3252,This laptop had officially outdated today with newer models.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3253,Source?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3253,E490 is Intel based not AMD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3253,"Other than that model, Lenovo have not announced update model."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3253,to E485/E585 yet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3254,They had been announced and selling on website now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3254,13 hours battery life.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3255,Don't see the amd based ones.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3255,Only see the Intel's one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3255,"Even if got new amd ones, not sure if the performance difference is worth the upgrade, probably for those that haven't bought the older model."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3256,How does a brand new working laptop suddenly become 'outdated' when new models arrive?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3256,I dont follow the logic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3256,"Anyway, feel happier with the e585"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3256,the more I use it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3256,"Looks really 'handsome', unlike other budget laptops."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3256,"Appreciate lenovo following through with consistent design principles from their top end X1 Carbon/Yoga series right down to the e585, which makes me feel really nice."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3256,Weird thing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3256,I get distracted by the trackpoint in middle of keyboard
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3256,so I try to avoid it and end up with typos..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3256,ha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3257,"Agree, especially the chip use is just a refresh."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3257,There won't be any major improvements or big jump in performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3257,Unless there is Thinkpad based on H series than maybe.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3257,a different story.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3257,H series TDP is higher at 35 watt as compare with U series at 15 watt.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3257,I doubt Lenovo will want to release a Thinkpad with H series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3257,since that is more for gaming than work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3258,next gen of AMD mobile processors was just announced last week.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3258,not even released yet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3259,FYI
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3259,these Thinpads are announced during CES 2019
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3259,Thinkpad X1 Carbon
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3259,Thinkpad X1 Yoga
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3259,Thinkpad E490s
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3259,"All are Intel based, no AMD based are being announced."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3259,The E490S is also Intel based and the price is much higher.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3259,than E485/E585.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3260,I have been using it for two days now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3260,I am quite a budget person and was happy to have good value for money.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3260,"On the stock Wifi card, the behaviour was quite acceptable for my low end usage it ranges from 230mbps up/down on LANSpeedtestwhen"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3260,i am in the same room as my router and drops to 6mbps up/down on LANSpeedtest when i have two wooden doors separating my laptop from the router.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3260,I find 6bmps still very acceptable for my very low end usage and was aware of this compromise at this price point.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3260,"As such, no intention to upgrade the wifi card."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3260,P.S:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3260,6mbps is not a typo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3261,I received the promo email and initially thought that it was AMD new release.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3261,"Upon further reading , this was clearly not the case, the actual phrase was ""Optional AMD discrete graphics."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3262,"Hi folks,
May I know is there somewhere"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3262,I could take a look at the E585 screen to see how bright it is before I order online?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3262,Thanks in advance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3263,I doubt this model even the showroom at Bugis/Causeway point will have.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3263,Closer model you can compare is e480
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3263,but that is Intel based.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3263,Screen wise should be more or less the same since it fall under E series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3264,Hijack a bit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3264,Anybody used L380 before?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3264,How is it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3264,Need a laptop for school/home.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3264,"With education pricing, L380i5+256gb SSD with 3 year warranty + upgrade to 16 GB ram @$1297 good deal?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3265,Gotta wait for the amd ones bah..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3266,I think the manufacturers have successfully brainwashed you to think a new model means better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3266,"While it is newer, the improvements regardless of Intel or AMD chips are negligible of late."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3266,"Unless there is a something significantly wrong with the older model, then may be worth looking to see if the newer model will address this issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3266,I don't see it in the case of the E485/585.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3267,"hmmm whenever got fb video playing, screen will go full black then flicker back.. on latest v1000 drivers for  e585.. still not resolve.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3267,anyone else have this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3267,or my screen faulty?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3268,Driver fault wait for new drivers
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3269,Install the driver from Lenovo?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3269,See how.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3270,"I have a E585, u can always drop by to have a look at it"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3271,Driver issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3271,wait for the 2019 amd new drivers
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3272,"Well, I took the plunge and bought a E485 today."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3272,Total damage SGD 737.02.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3272,Selected Ryzen 5 with 1x8GB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3272,"For some strange reason, upgrade from base 4GB to 8GB saves me 40 bucks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3272,Quite odd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3273,Wtf ups never deliver and claimed they did.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3273,No attempted notice but update that delivery failed on the website???
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3273,"Waste one whole night waiting for the package, smh...."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3274,Haha ups
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3274,.. epic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3275,Hi bro..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3275,This is how lenovo website works:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3275,A upgrade 4gb to 8bg - Cost $60.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3275,B Ram upgrade promo - Cost -ve
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3275,100
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3275,Net of A and B =
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3275,-40
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3276,Hi bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3276,I called their help desk to request courier man to call me 30min before arrival.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3276,And he really called me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3277,"Too late haiz,  if today nvr deliver I gonna rage😠"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3278,Recieved it what programs should I download from lenovo after I do a fresh install
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3279,I recommend the Vantage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3279,Made driver upgrade easy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3279,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3280,"Alright, thanks"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3281,Need to update bios?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3282,"Run the Vantage, it will show you the bios and drivers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3282,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3283,Wondering if there are any bros like me who are still using the stock Wifi card?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3284,Hi.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3284,Could you provide the Taobao link so that i can know which vendor is trusted
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3284,i am assuming it is from Taobao?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3284,TQ.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3285,I am..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3285,so far so good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3286,I probably will stick to the stock Wifi card when I get my E485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3286,"Its mainly for work and studies, so don't need wonderful transfer rate."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3287,Is the graphics card driver a common issue on these laptops?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3287,Intending to get this as a desktop replacement and connect to 24 inch monitor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3287,Watch alot of YouTube videos.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3288,Errr... I rather you build a AMD Ryzen DIY PC instead if you do not.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3288,intend to bring out the PC.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3289,I'm actually already using laptop with vertical stand for such a use case.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3289,Really like the desk space savings and flexibility if I want to work on bed or sofa etc.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3289,Easier to clean and maintain also!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3290,For those who is interested...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3290,"I'm getting intel 9260ac to try out, if it works well, I will sell away my killer 1535."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3290,Those interested to get can pm me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3290,It's atheros chipset 2x2 +
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3290,bt 4.2 or 4.1.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3290,P.S.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3290,I selling away the killer 1535
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3290,"cheap, maybe $5 to $10 cost price for me is sgd$20ish."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3290,I don't mind giving away for free anyway.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3290,Just pm me if you interested.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3290,I just ordered intel 9260ac today.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3291,Agree.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3291,You will better off with ryzen 2400g with that kind of money.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3292,Err.... there is a form factor called SFF or ITX if you want.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3292,a PC that is small and compact other than laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3292,Laptop is meant for portability if you don't need to carry.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3292,it around than a desktop would be better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3292,Either DIY or can consider a pre-build one like this.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3292,based on Ryzen pro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3293,Yes.. cause amd driver release is slow..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3293,But they did promise better updates and release for 2019.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3293,Remains to be seen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3294,More reason to get a DIY Ryzen system than a NB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3295,"with new intel ac9260 drivers released Jan 2019, I now get 400 down, 130 up consistently."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3295,"the down speed almost doubled from original atheros wifi card, so it's definitely a worthwhile upgrade, despite the poorer up speed for me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3295,I've edited my previous post accordingly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3296,May i have the Taobao link
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3296,please?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3296,"On a separate matter, I find that Lenovo plastic panels fit very well and therefore have very small gaps."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3296,I have to use my car panel removal tool to snap it open.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3297,I don't know how to DIY full setup so have to rely on SLS or pre built.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3297,The price point for the SFF in the link is also quite way off this laptop once I load in similar specs as I'm going for 16gb ram..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3297,This laptop price point is really quite unbeatable due partly to the ram discount. .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3298,"Can ask in hwc, saw some setup less than $600."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3298,But if you are looking at 16GB than the price will be higher since DDR-4 prices are quite high.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3299,I did post the link several pages back.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3299,anyway:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3299,"yes I feel lenovo cases are well made too, having opened acers before hate opening acers btw."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3299,"for e585 case opening I start with my thumb nail at front corner, then slip credit card in and slide along edge carefully."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3299,can be slightly nerve-wrecking for first timers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3299,"also many tiny screws and delicate parts, so"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3299,if no real need and not confident then better leave the laptop alone but can your itchy fingers resist?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3300,btw not sure if some of you are aware can get shopback rebate from lenovo online orders.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3300,"I was skeptical, didnt take it seriously, then received email about pending $40"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3300,+ cashback to be paid out to me on 9 March prob to guard against product returns.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3300,now i'm a believer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3301,Tq for reposting the link.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3301,Also thanks for the pro tip on taking out the cover.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3301,I will follow this in future.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3301,"For my ""first time"" last week, I started pulling from Ethernet port area since there is a lobang"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3301,"and I kind of swore never to do again this way  as I heard a ""kiak"" sound which was a bit scary."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3302,"Anyway for those using intel 9260ac, you may even want to try killer 1550 drivers on it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3302,"So far what i read up, performance is even better using stock intel drivers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3302,"AFAIK, it can be installed even yours is not killer card."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3302,I might be wrong.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3302,P.S.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3302,"Anyway fyi, for those who did not know, killer 1550 is using intel 9260ac chipset."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3302,Cheers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3303,You managed to load it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3303,The current killer driver can't use.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3303,It will try to detect the hardware and refused to install.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3303,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3304,"2 little tips to share:
- better to disable battery via bios before opening the case."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3304,it auto re-enables once AC power is supplied.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3304,"=- If you will never use the camera, like me, for extra privacy/security, you can hole punch out a sticky note sticky part then stick the circle over the camera."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3304,it fits perfectly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3304,looks even nicer if you colour the sticky black before punching.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3305,"Well, I haven't got mine yet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3305,Just ordered yesterday.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3305,Lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3305,Will try once I get my hands on it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3305,So far info is what I have read on.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3306,Just installed my VM Ware Pro 15 on my E585
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3306,this evening prerequisite:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3306,had to turn on AMD virtualisation in the BIOS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3306,Was very happy that VM Ware works without a hitch and my virtual machines are functioning normally need my virtual machines to do sales demo on my laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3307,"FYI, between E485 and A485."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3307,There is Thinkshutter meaning the webcam there is a shutter to conceal it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3308,wah.. they even gave that shutter a name..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3308,I forgot 1 more tip:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3308,entirely optional
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3308,"if you did not fresh install windows after swapping wifi cards, then the old wifi card drivers are still in there."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3308,"open device manager, click View tab, enable Show hidden devices, expand Bluetooth and Network adapters, right click old wifi card to uninstall the drivers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3308,"Despite doing this and rebooting though, a qualcomm wlan driver service still runs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3308,I dont know how to remove it properly
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3308,so i just deleted three related files from windows-system32-drivers folder.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3309,Preload OS most of the OEM drivers are included inside.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3309,the OS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3309,Just uninstall from device manager will do.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3310,Just a heads up for those looking for bigger nvme SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3310,"Crucial P1 1TB for less than SGD 200 on newegg, free shipping to SG:

Ordered 1 to upgrade my E585."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3310,best price for 1TB nvme SSD so far.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3310,Shall keep the stock lenovo 128GB just in case for warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3311,"A quick check, when you ordered your E585 did you also included the hard disk?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3311,Was thinking to not order the SSD to lower the price of the laptop then buy cheapest SSD and install.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3312,"When you bought under student discount, is it using your school email?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3313,Wow!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3313,The price is incredible!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3313,Thanks for sharing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3313,Do share with us on the performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3313,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3314,When you register for an account at the Lenovo Education Store you put your school email address as email address.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3314,That becomes your Lenovo account name.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3315,"Nope no HDD, only 128GB SSD"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3315,to tide me over until I found a cheap 1TB NVME
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3315,Anyway Lenovo includes the SATA cable and the dummy HDD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3316,is it student discount auto applied?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3317,It is not auto applied.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3317,During checkout the system will detect the promo code and ask if you want to activate it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3317,You can choose to activate it or enter another promo code.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3317,If you log on to the education store it will propose you the promo code for student.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3317,If you have a better code you can enter it and get better discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3318,HI Bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3318,Can I confirm that both the SATA cable + dummy HDD are inside the laptop itself?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3318,It wasnt in my UPS shipping box.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3319,yup it is installed in the laptop itself where the HDD would be.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3319,If you unscrew the bottom panel of the laptop you can see it immediately.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3320,Heng ah!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3320,TQ!!!!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3321,"After using for two days, this laptop is so worth the money $550!!!!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3321,haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3321,kinda sad
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3321,i did not pay the extra 90 dollars to upgrade to a 2500u
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3322,"I actually saw this on Prime Now yesterday, but decided to go for the Crucial MX500 1TB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3322,185 less 10 bucks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3322,POSB CC promo instead after reading the review.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3322,"While it is a decent enough NVME SSD at below 200 bucks, it is running QLC NAND, which I am trying to avoid."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3322,"In most day to day usage, it should not be a problem."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3323,Sorry I missed your PM for a couple of days.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3323,I usually uses the mobile phone to read HWZ and thus don't check mailbox.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3323,Hope that the answers on this thread sufficiently answered your question.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3323,Student discount on Lenovo is $300.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3323,I believe there are some promo discount code that can give $250 for adults.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3323,The difference is only $50.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3323,I believe it is not just Lenovo that are giving discounts to students.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3323,I think Apple Store also have similar student type of discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3323,It is wonderful time to be student in Singapore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3324,Ok had some free time so decided to test vega's real-world gaming capabilities.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3324,Should be able to breeze through old game like TF2 correct?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3324,"Nope, lagged occasionally even with graphics tuned down to medium low settings on LAN."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3324,"Task manager showed bottleneck with dedicated gpu memory used up all 256mb, but the 5.8gb shared gpu memory remains untouched."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3324,GPU usage between 30-85%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3324,"We know e585 is no gaming laptop, but still a little surprised it could not handle an old low spec game smoothly throughout despite having an igpu."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3324,"my specs: ryzen 5 vega 8, 8+4GB ram, nvme SSD, default video drivers, default radeon settings."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3324,UPDATE:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3324,Solved.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3324,"I changed the settings back UP to high defaults, even adding 2 X MSAA."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3324,Much better now no lag
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3324,just a tiny lag sometimes when very intense.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3324,Makes no sense except that that must be its 'sweet spot'.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3325,8 + 4 GB?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3325,Don't have a Ryzen laptop on hand so for me I can't test.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3326,U need to update the drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3326,Default one is not good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3327,"Eh, I have played a few rounds of TF2 on my E585 Ryzen 5, 24GB RAM, NVMe SSD at FHD and maxed out settings and never encountered any issues."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3327,"Playing on AC power of course, havent tried on battery yet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3328,You mean the alternative drivers?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3328,I downloaded them but not installing yet unless really have to and gains are significant.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3328,My impression is the alternatives are not super stable?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3328,Default drivers
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3328,no issue so far.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3329,isnt MX500 limited to SATA speeds?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3329,yeah
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3329,the Crucial P1 is QLC
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3329,but they say its endurance of 100GB writes per day for 5 years
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3329,so I have no issues with that.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3329,Not going to be running benchmarks or downloading large files on my laptop everyday.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3330,No lag at all even during intense action?!?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3330,What radeon drivers you using?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3330,does task manager ever report shared gpu memory being used?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3331,"nope, not even when pushing the kart with all 20+ players clustered around the final capture point."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3331,"have to go back and check, didnt really monitor task manager when playing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3331,"I didnt install any custom drivers, only updated via the Lenovo Vantage app."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3332,hmm.. our machines are pretty much the same.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3332,I still have 3+gb ram free during TF2 so that's not the issue....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3332,hmmmmmm....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3333,Could it be ur 4 + 8gb ram?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3333,Heard the ryzen/vega performance r very dependent on dual channel memory capability.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3334,"yes i expected perhaps difference of couple fps, but shouldnt be so drastic..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3335,"Could be cuz different size and speed, dual channel may not work optimally."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3335,But depend on the chipset so best to use CPU-Z to see
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3335,is it dual channel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3335,If on budget than add another 4 to make it 4 + 4 so Dual channel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3335,can work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3336,Your RAM 8GB + 4GB are from the factory?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3336,is your RAM running in dual channel mode?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3336,"I ordered mine 8GB RAM from factory, added another stick of 16GB 2400mhz in."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3336,Luckily it could run in dual channel with the factory stick.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3337,yup checked they're in dual channel mode 2400mhz.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3337,"in any case, the difference to real world use is supposed to be very minute."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3337,I think it's due to something else....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3337,hmmm
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3338,"Yes, its limited to SATA speed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3338,"Considering the fact that use both 970 Pro and 850 Pro on my current desktop, I never really felt that the 970 Pro is significantly faster than the 850 Pro when running apps or OS on it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3338,"So I really don't see the benefits of NVME, at least not in a day to day usage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3338,I've read the reviews on the P1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3338,and I don't quite like what I see.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3338,"The performance fluctuations are too huge, and while I expect QLC to be cheaper than TLC, it is not the case at this point."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3339,Monitor the temps and the clockspeed for both the CPU and GPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3339,"Anyway while the system is the same, it also depends on what applications are running in the background that will take up precious resources."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3340,"If it is only CPU, the impact may be limited, i.e. not all applications will benefit from a higher memory bandwidth."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3340,"However if you consider that the CPU and GPU are sharing the same memory, if its not running at dual channel, it will have a significant impact on performance when both are under load."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3341,Here is what I see in task manager during TF2.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3341,"I have 24GB RAM in total, 8GB+16GB in dual channel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3341,"Playing at FHD resolution, most details on high and v-sync off."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3341,"typical 50 FPS, drops to around 35 FPS during intense parts of the game"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3342,more details from GPU-Z max values while playing TF2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3343,Thanks kangdi and others for leads and advice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3343,EDIT:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3343,Solved.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3343,"Since it works for kangdi, I decided what the heck and changed the settings back UP to high defaults, even adding 2 X MSAA."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3343,Much better now no lag
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3343,just a tiny lag sometimes when very intense.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3343,Makes no sense except that that must be its 'sweet spot'.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3343,I must've lowered settings earlier trying to fix that tiny lag....... and made it worse
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3344,Don't look at the max values.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3344,You should check the real time clockspeed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3344,"The APU cannot sustained at max clockspeed, especially in games when both the CPU and GPU are under load."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3344,The limitation is with the 15W TDP.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3344,"Its got a TDP up, which I suspect should be 25W that allows the clockspeed to go up temporarily."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3344,It can't sustain it unfortunately.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3345,Seems like there is new official drivers from amd.. not sure if it works though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3346,where did you see the new drivers?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3347,"For people with E485/585, is it possible to change the system language from English to Chinese so everything is displayed in Chinese with the included Windows 10 Home?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3348,Amd website..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3348,but doesn't seem to have support for ryzen laptop yet?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3349,I think there is a new version released on the 21 Jan.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3349,"However, its likely for the desktop version."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3350,"Finally got my E485 today, and I gotta say I really like the build and the classic Thinkpad look."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3350,"So far I did not run in any issues with it, though I was wrestling to clone the OS drive to another M.2 drive because I believe is due to licensing issues."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3350,Upgraded it with a Crucial MX500 drive with additional 8GB ram.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3350,Will spend more time to explore it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3350,I did notice that there's no Radeon software installed for the GPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3350,Is that normal?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3351,Hi bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3351,Any pro tips for opening back panel for the faint hearted like me?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3351,Everyone has a different way of opening .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3351,I am not sure if I have the Radeon software.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3352,Loosen all the screws and start working on the sides of the laptop first.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3352,The are being held tight by some clips that will easily open.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3352,"I used my finger nails, but it hurts."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3352,Haha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3352,You can use a plastic card or some flat plastic to slide along the openings.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3352,Do not use any metal object as it will likely scratch or chip the plastic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3352,"Once the sides are open, I tackled the back of the laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3352,"The front seems very tightly shut, but will come out once 3 sides are opened."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3352,"The plastic used is quite thick and sturdy, so generally you don't have to worry about breaking something."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3352,"As long as you don't yank it open, it should be fine."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3353,Tq.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3353,Noted on the nail technique
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3354,Just curious how long did you wait?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3355,I waited two weeks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3355,"Not sure if it was because:
1."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3355,I ordered on a Friday night.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3355,2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3355,My notebook went from Hefei -->
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3355,Shanghai -->
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3355,Incheon KR -->
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3355,Shenzhen then to Spore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3355,Their committed delivery date is accurate.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3355,It stated two weeks.......
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3356,Got my unit around 2 weeks too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3356,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3357,About a week and half.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3358,"I was also perplexed by the need to ship out of China and back, before it is enroute to Singapore."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3359,"Anyway after playing around with it for awhile, I noticed that the back light of the monitor seems to flicker randomly."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3359,Not sure if anyone had the same problem before?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3359,"Also I experienced corrupted graphics once in Hardwarezone forum, which I suspect is driver related."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3359,"Other than these, so far its been working well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3360,Try to update the driver?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3360,I noticed flickering when on battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3360,On AC seems fine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3360,Still not sure whether it is driver related.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3360,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3361,"Flicker only when it's on battery, not sure if it is due to driver issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3361,Corrupted graphics try to install the v1000 drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3361,Should help reduce.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3361,Otherwise wait for the new drivers that amd promise.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3362,"Yeah, that is correct."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3362,It happened when I am running it on battery earlier.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3362,I did not pick up this flickering issue yesterday when it was charging.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3362,Noted on the driver update.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3363,Wireless network speed is quite decent.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3363,I ran Speedtest and got 325Mbps down and about 310Mbps up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3363,Network card is a Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3364,I am also able to achieve the same throughput as you indicated when I am in the same room as the router.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3364,"However, if I am separated by two closed doors, the throughput falls drastically to about 30mbps strangely downlink is affected more than uplink."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3364,"Therefore, despite my initial position of not changing the wifi card, I have placed an order for the  9260 wifi card because of sharp fall in throughout."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3365,"Just ran some quick test on a classic game, Company of Heroes 2."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3365,"Despite the age, it is still a pretty taxing game for the Vega 8."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3365,"Minimal frame rate at approx 16, highest about 31 @ 1080p low graphic settings."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3365,"But the good thing is, I observed pretty good temps when using it in conjunction with my laptop cooler."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3365,"Max temp recorded was 71 degs and while the fan noise is audible, it is still very soft."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3366,I see.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3366,"My router is placed in the middle of the house, so even in the living room, I am getting a solid 2 bars with 5G channel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3366,Did yours downgrade to 2.4G resulting in a steep drop in WIFI performance?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3367,Hi Bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3367,Yes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3367,You are right on all points.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3367,"Behind two closed doors , my 5Ghz dropped to no signal and 2.4ghZ dropped from full bar to two bars."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3367,"Therefore, you are also correct that in two closed door situations, only 2.4ghZ is detectable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3368,seems like the latest radeon drivers fixed the one time flickering black screen when playing  videos
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3369,From which site?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3369,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3370,1.9.1.2?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3371,How do you folks update the graphic driver?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3371,Just download and install directly from AMD's site?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3372,Yeah for amd vega
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3372,But my installation seems weird..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3372,I did clean installation
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3372,cause normal installation doesn't seem to update in amd ccc
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3373,Got it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3373,My driver and Radeon software installation seems messed up as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3373,I checked Vantage and they gave me the option to install the Radeon Software.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3373,"After installing and when I tried to launch it, it gave me an error that my driver version and Radeon Software is different."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3373,It will not launch...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3374,I also encountered this issue a few days back.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3374,Googled and found a suggestion that worked for me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3374,I rebooted the notebook after making the change.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3374,---------------------------------------------------------------
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3374,This is a trending issue that many users are running into.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3374,Here’s how to fix it:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3374,"Open Registry Editor, go to [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\AMD\CN]."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3374,Look for DriverVersion.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3374,Remove the value listed - leave it blank.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3374,"Then either reboot, or use the tool provided with CRU Custom Resolution Utility to close and restart Radeon Settings."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3374,This should solve the problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3374,-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3375,Thank you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3375,Will try those steps.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3375,"It's not a show stopper problem, just minor annoyance why it did not work out of the box."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3375,Haha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3376,downloaded 19.1.2 and just accept and custom install.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3376,seems to have fix the black out screen problem?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3376,monitor for awhile more.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3377,i kanna one BSOD..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3377,so reverted to vantage drivers
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3377,.. let me know
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3377,if u kanna also.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3377,"edit: seems like this latest drivers dated this yr, its not really installing the latest one under device manager dated apr 2018"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3378,"so far i what i can confirm is the black screen still persist, much lesser though."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3378,i check..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3378,even though its installed but the device manager drivers shows april also.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3378,odd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3379,What hardware do people normally self-upgrade vs choose to ship with purchase?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3380,SSD and ram can self upgrade because it is likely cheaper.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3381,I moved back to Lenovo display driver after i ran into flickering issue with the HDMI output on my Samsung TV.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3382,Would you void warranty or is there any risk here?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3383,Risk is only when you do a botched upgrade and end up damaging something in there.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3383,"Otherwise, you can always remove the ram and storage in case you want to send it back for service to play safe."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3384,Hi Guys.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3384,sorry i have a noob question.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3384,i have downloaded 19.1.2 and was trying to update the driver in Device manager.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3384,"However, i am unable to find the ""AMD Radeon Vega 8 graphic"" at 3.53minute mark of below video which was shared in earlier pages"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3384,May i know which one should i choose instead?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3384,Thanks in advance
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3385,I tried this couple of days back.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3385,"The good news is it works, and I can launch Radeon software."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3385,"The bad news, it freezes and not useable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3385,"When I hit the Global settings, it just froze and unresponsive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3385,Had to force close it after waiting for sometime.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3385,Haha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3386,I think in another forum posting someone suggested that enter the version number to be the same as the actual Version on your notebook as opposed to leaving it blank.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3386,I kept it as blank as I do not update graphic driver yet.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3392,"Was on lenovo educator store playing around with some customization, any that you guys recommend?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3392,Above specs cost $807.03.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3392,Trying not to hit over 1k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3393,Ram wise either 2 X 4GB or 2 X 8GB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3393,Or you can get ram elsewhere.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3393,Single channel will impact the performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3393,So dual channel would be preferred.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3394,Nice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3394,Thanks for sharing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3395,Really big improvement.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3397,16gb imo is better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3398,Are you getting a E585 or E485?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3398,You did not select a SATA3 harddisk.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3398,I assumed that you want to buy and install yourself.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3398,There is another thread where the TS stated that his E485 did not come with the empty harddisk tray.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3398,For the E585 it does come with the empty harddisk tray.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3398,From your pricing it looked like you are ordering E485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3399,"That guy is talking abt A485, not E485."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3400,Hi All.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3400,For my self installed Sata3 SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3400,", I did not place the Sata3 SSD in the metal enclosure since the metal enclosure has no screw thread to secure it to the chasis on it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3400,"That means with or without the metal enclosure, the Sata3 SSD is held in place only by the Sata3 socket."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3400,Maybe I should stick a double sided tape the next time I open up the back cover.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3401,Call Lenovo for the cage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3401,Cuz if you drop or bang the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3401,The SSD may pop out easily
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3401,that is why a cage is needed to secure it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3401,Double side won't work due to heat.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3401,Overtime the glue will melt than the SSD will still drop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3402,I thought the holder is some kind of flexible plastic part?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3403,Yep bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3403,Flexible plastic with some aluminium strips.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3404,Okee.. I have the cage i took it out and put on my table.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3404,Looks like I have to use my nails to open the backcover tonight
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3405,Can used a card or plastic knife to do it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3406,Aiyo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3406,I just reached home and realised that I have a dummy SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3406,but there  was no cage attached.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3406,Did yours come with a cage wrapped around the dummy SSD or you had to separately call Lenovo for it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3407,There is no cage as such.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3407,"It is just a soft plastic that goes around the dummy drive, which you use on the SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3408,OK.understand.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3408,I have emailed Lenovo to request for the plastic spacer you described.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3409,I have did the express install.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3409,It was mentioned that the installation was completed.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3410,VMs are working as expected.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3411,Hi Bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3411,I just tested my 850evo with Crystal and
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3411,the sequential read/ write is around 2000Mbps/1300Mbps.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3411,I was surprised because I tot Sata max out at around 500Mbps.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3411,Why ah?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3412,This is a strange metrics.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3412,"Anyway, if it is Mbps Megabit and not MBps Mega Byte, then it may be correct."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3412,SATA 3 maxes out 600 MBps theoretically.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3413,For SATA Driver?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3413,Is it MS AHCI Driver or AMD AHCI Driver?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3414,Thank you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3414,I understand now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3414,Paiseh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3415,Nothing to be paiseh man.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3415,I am just thinking why Crystal mark will show in Mbps instead of MBps.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3416,Have you gotten it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3416,Any update?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3417,Is E585 form factor 2280?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3417,The manual doesnt indicate.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3418,"recieved it 1 week ago, installed windows with no issues."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3418,really decent speeds with around 2000MB/s read and
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3418,1500MB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3418,/s write sequential.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3418,slower than WD Black or Samsung 970
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3418,but those are easily twice the price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3418,SGD

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3423,"Whichever way, you will be hit with the currency conversion."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3423,"In the case of iHerb, if you check out using SGD, the price is already inclusive of conversion rate."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3429,Is this laptop’s E585 wifi card that bad?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3429,Any guides to replacing it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3429,TIA
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3430,"Easy to change the card, search youtube for a visual guide."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3431,"Its not that bad to be honest, but really depends on your expectations."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3431,I have been using it for more than a week now
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3431,and I have no issues with the WIFI performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3432,New drivers for GPU from amd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3433,Dear Bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3433,Please refer to the following youtube for T480.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3433,The back cover design is quite similar only difference is two hinge design for T480 vs one hinge design for E585
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3433,but it doesnt make a difference in terms of taking it off .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3433,The video also shows how to disconnect your wifi card + 2x antennae.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3433,I agree with forummer watzup_ken that the stock wifi card is quite ok.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3433,"For me, i chose to replace it because i like to sit in a windy part of my house that happens to be a dead spot and also wrong placement choice for my router which i dont intend to correct anytime soon."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3434,I am running CPU-Z and under Graphics tab inside the Memory section it says my memory size is only 256mb.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3434,Is that correct?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3434,I am having E585 with Ryzen 7 with Vega 10 graphic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3434,I am unable to play Gear of War 4
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3434,and I am getting error
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3434,GW410.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3434,It says my memory is only 0.2gb and cannot play the game.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3435,"Generally, it's better to pay in USD and take the credit card foreign currency transaction fee + VISA/Master fee total about ~3"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3435,+1% than to pay in SGD with dynamic currency conversion check their conversion rate against google or whatever.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3435,Especially true if you're using miles cards that give you bonuses for foreign currency transactions.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3435,"If you're using debit cards or credit cards that give cashback <3-4%, you might want to consider using something like youtrip load SGD, convert in app to forex, pay with forex to avoid those fees."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3435,"There are quite a few of those cards around these days, so you can shop around to see what you like."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3436,I agree with you when it comes to buying from Amazon or Newegg.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3436,"In terms of IHerb, I don't see a big difference in terms of buying with SGD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3436,Which is why I switched from USD to SGD when buying from iHerb.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3437,Unfortunately you can't change the memory dedicated to the iGPU here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3437,It is dynamically allocated.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3437,Also can it run GOW4?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3437,"On the desktop variant, I am sure it can run at low settings, but on this ultra low power APU, it may not be playable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3438,i think its dynamic?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3438,max is 2gb?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3438,unsure of this.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3439,anyway the latest gpu drivers from amd doesn't seem to have much difference in terms of bug fixs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3439,still awaiting the drivers from amd that they say will release..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3440,GOW4 need 2GB of VRAM which unfortunately means need a dedicated graphic card to run it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3441,Sian x 100.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3441,I bought this game for fun last year.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3441,Only played it for a short while on my son's desktop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3441,Was planning to built a ryzen rig but decided to buy E585 instead.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3441,Now the money put into this notebook is no longer worth it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3441,I thought I can play some games on the notebook.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3441,Just a causal gamer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3442,Certain games
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3442,iGPU won't be able to handle/support it
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3442,"so need a
dedicated graphic card."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3443,"Can play, just not the gfx intensive ones.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3444,u should have done your research properly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3444,"nevertheless, u can always sell it off to fund for your Ryzen Rig instead"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3445,"It will run some games, but realistically, it is a 15W APU, so I won't expect it to run as well as what you read for the desktop variants with significantly more power to share for both the CPU and GPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3445,"So assuming that the memory is not an issue, I believe it will also be a stuttering mess for this game."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3446,"Thanks bro, my router is pretty near where I usually work."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3446,"Thanks, very helpful and useful video!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3446,Yep probably wont replace us for now since my workspace is pretty much covered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3447,Then it should not be a problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3447,"For me, I am quite close to the router when using it at home."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3447,"And if I do bring it out, it connects to my phone for WIFI, which will also be near."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3448,I read the starting of this thread in July 2018 have $200 discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3448,Now cny 2019 also have $200 discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3448,"When I was placing order after 10pm, discount changed to $250."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3448,Sweet
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3448,..... Decided to order one set.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3449,Do you want to share with us which model and configuration that you ordered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3450,I am using E585.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3450,How do we go into BIOS?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3450,I tried F1 during startup and it does not work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3451,"Yes, I noticed this happens on one night as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3451,"The usual code ""AMD18/"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3451,"AMD19"""
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3451,"that gives 200 bucks discount will become ""SGNIGHT"" that gives the 250 bucks discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3452,"You can either,
1"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3452,"At start up, hit ""Enter"", then select F1 to go into BIOS at the selection screen, or,
2 Hold Shift and restart the PC."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3452,"When the screen appears, you need to look for one that allows you to select ""Troubleshoot PC"" and then Boot in UEFI."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3453,And need press quickly if you are on ssd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3453,I missed most of the time.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3454,Thanks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3454,Point 1 does not seemed to work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3454,Point 2 works except during boot up
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3454,"I must press ENTER to enter the Bios, else it does into normal boot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3455,Press enter fast..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3455,lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3455,SSD very fast.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3456,"I ordered E485, Ryzen 5, 8GB x1, 256GB ssd, 65W ac adapter for $857.03 with SGNIGHT discount"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3457,I see.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3457,"When I shut down, I always hold Shift before I hit the shut down button."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3457,I read somewhere
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3457,"that if you don't do that, it goes into sort of a hibernation mode, which bypasses the BIOS screen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3457,"Not sure if this is the reason why you can't find that screen to press ""Enter""."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3458,"Good buy, but I would still opt for the cheapest SSD if I choose again."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3458,I feel the SSD upgrade is quite expensive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3458,"For example, I can find a Crucial MX500 1TB SATA 3 SSD on Prime Now for 176 bucks after 10 bucks discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3459,Yup.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3459,I think the difference here is the pressing of the SHIFT key during shutdown.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3459,Else during bootup the interruption message followed by ENTER option will not appear on the screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3460,I agree too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3460,I had actually initially selected the 128gb ssd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3460,"But after the extra $50 discount appeared after 10pm, I decided to just go for the 256gb and not bother having to manually upgrading it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3460,Sent from HMD Global NOKIA 7 PLUS using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3461,I believe you will add in another slot of ram?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3461,Optimal to run dual channel for this APU because of the shared memory for CPU and GPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3462,the SSD for 2280 confirm is NVME?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3462,not Sata right.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3462,any good deals?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3463,NVME SSD usually cost more than SATA.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3463,NVME is faster but not noticeable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3464,"yes, it is a NVME."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3465,"Yes, its NVME."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3466,"To add on, it cost significantly more."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3466,One usually pays a premium of at least 30% when between a SATA3 and a good NVME SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3467,"hello guys, I just put in my SSD"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3467,What program would you recommend to move the OS over from the default HDD to SSD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3468,If I have a new SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3468,I generally prefer to re-install the OS rather than cloning the OS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3468,Your windows keys are already embedded into the BIOS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3468,After you have re-install the OS you can then find the key and activate Windows.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3468,The advantage is that you have a clean installation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3468,The disadvantage is of course it is a tedious process and you need to copy the drivers over.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3468,I would try the clean install first just for knowledge learning.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3468,If it dun work then you clone it lor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3468,I have already used the clean install method on two machine last year alone.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3468,I cannot recommend any cloning software as it has been a while that I clone OS liao.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3473,Still awaiting the official amd ryzen drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3474,This is supposed to be released every quarter?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3474,"Anyway, I am still waiting for AMD to make good on their words to improve driver support on their mobile chips."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3474,They really need to be serious if they want to gain back market share in the mobile space.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3475,"Just my two cents, I think the new driver will come like this: - Release to manufacturer first."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3475,- Generic Mobile Driver to follow
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3475,Since AMD Ryzen 3XXX series is around the corner.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3475,Laptop with the new chip will come with the newest driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3475,Probably once 3XXX series are officially out than the generic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3475,driver mobile will follow.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3475,Probably june or so so for the meantime check the manufacturer website
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3475,they will definitely get the driver first.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3476,Time consuming and not tedious
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3476,u mean?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3476,Cos most of the time is just waiting for it to complete.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3476,And by right it will also auto install the required latest drivers?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3476,No need to copy over unless you want specific drivers to use.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3477,Auto install required latest drivers is more common for desktop installation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3477,For notebook I observe that manufacturer tends to has more specific drivers that we need to either download from their website or that we must take it from one of the folders from the original drive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3477,"Take the AMD drivers for example, we can't use the one from AMD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3477,We must use the one from Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3477,Maybe it is my lack of experience that I find it tedious AND time consuming.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3477,Still clean installation is a better way in my opinion.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3478,"Hi guys, if your screen is experiencing green or black flashes during video playback, I think that it has something to do with the driver's handling of Direct3D 11 hardware acceleration."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3478,One way is to disable Chrome's hardware acceleration.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3478,"However, instead of disabling hardware acceleration totally, you can also try this workaround:"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3478,Credit:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3479,"For notebook whether Intel/AMD, best to use manufacturer driver."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3479,Especially if the driver for graphic Windows install is for.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3479,desktop than battery as well as performance will be affected.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3479,Not to mention certain devices have certain features/add-on.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3479,which is only enabled through the standalone alone installation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3480,I always disable the hardware acceleration in Chrome.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3480,"It seems to cause more problems for me, not just limited to this laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3480,"For example when I was using a combination of Intel + Nvidia hardware, Chrome will keep crashing until I disable hardware acceleration."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3481,Suppose to release first quarter i think..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3481,the new 3000 series is coming already..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3481,so i suppose drivers will be out soon?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3482,trying the optional tip.. hope it works.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3482,but i still hope that the official drivers will fix all these issues.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3482,Don't have to use all this tricks to fix the problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3482,*
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3482,update*
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3482,just using opencl makes some website unable to load.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3482,"if use no hardware acceleration, the cpu load is much higher."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3482,Though its still plays 4k smoothly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3482,I really hope amd comes out with more such VEGA apu.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3482,Really like the AIO combination.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3483,Hi all.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3483,Any differences between e485 and e585 apart from the size/weight?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3483,"Thinking of getting one for the wife, she only does light browsing and video streaming, so don't need to be mobile with the laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3483,Ryzen 3 sufficient or should get 5 or 7?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3483,Thanks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3484,3000 series almost here the first laptop will Asus FX505dy
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3484,AMD Ryzen 3550H
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3484,with Radeon 560X.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3484,Driver most likely will come by than.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3485,"14 inch vs 15 inch, if you want portability than e485 will do."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3485,Recommend Ryzen 5 as Ryzen 3 is dual core while 5 is quad core.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3486,"For web browsing & video streaming, a Ryzen 3 with 8GB ram is more than enough."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3487,I also support the idea that Ryzen 5 is better than 3.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3487,Notebook can last three years and it will slow down as technology advances.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3487,We can't upgrade the CPU in notebook.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3487,If the premium is bearable you want a higher CPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3487,I bought Ryzen 7 for this reason.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3488,For portability.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3488,"get the e485, do note this is not ultraportable though."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3488,so don't expect it to be super light weight also.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3488,ryzen 5
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3488,at least imo cause of quad core.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3489,"hopefully..
really need some good drivers"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3490,Today I opened up my laptop and to install a hard drive and decided to apply some after market thermal compound to see if it will help bring down the heat.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3490,"Taking the heatsink off is very easy, just loosen the 4 screws holding the heatsink to the processor, and a light pull and the entire heatsink and fan will pop out."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3490,Just be careful of the fan power cable because they look very thin and flimsy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3490,"Anyway, I think I may not have installed the heatsink back"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3490,well cause seems to be getting very hot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3490,"Like at idle, its 60+ degs, and easily hit 80 degs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3490,Haha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3490,Not sure why the CPU seems to be working very hard.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3490,"Anyway, more work to do before I update again."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3491,"Anyway, I just wanted to check what is the idle and load temps that people are getting on this laptop with a Ryzen 5 please?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3491,"I wanted to do a comparison before and after, but now I don't remember how hot it used to run."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3491,"I've not reapply the thermal compound again, but I did noticed that the temps run high as a result of initial high CPU usage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3491,"I did noticed that the clockspeed seems to hold above 2.2 Ghz in most cases, 200Mhz higher than the base clock, with short boost to over 3Ghz."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3492,What thermal paste did you apply?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3493,I used Thermal Grizzly Kyronaut.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3493,"Anyway, I opened the laptop up again to check."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3493,Tighten the screws more to improve the contact.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3493,"I can feel that the heatpipes heat up really quick throughout including the heatsink, so I think the  contact is good."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3493,Problem I believe is with the fan profile.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3493,"The fan only seems to kick in when the laptop hits about 62 to 65 degs, otherwise, it is not spinning at all."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3493,"Also I noticed slight coil whine, which I initially thought was due to the fan."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3493,But I observed the fan was not spinning and the slight humming sound is not coming from the fan.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3494,"If temp not improving, suggest try another thermal compound like Noctua."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3494,Can get from SLS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3494,Tip to secure back the heat stink correctly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3494,You have to secure the screws diagonally.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3494,This is to ensure proper pressure so the heat sink is secure to the CPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3494,Meaning top right to lower left and etc.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3495,"Yes, I did this."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3495,"Thermal compound wise, I believe the Thermal Grizzly is one of the best out there other than liquid metal."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3495,"It worked well with my graphic card, so I thought might as well use it on the laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3496,A good estimate of improvement will be idle temperature.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3497,Many factors can cause wild fluctuations.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3497,Thermal profiles can be finicky.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3497,"On my Dell, if I wake it up on battery, it will sometimes throttle itself to a certain frequency e.g. 1.89 of 3.46GHz."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3497,"Plugging in and out the charger will cause it to ""remember"" that it can turbo and now it turbos all the way even on battery."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3497,Results in higher temps too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3498,I cannot really ascertain whether it's poor contact here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3498,The temps can swing from 45 to 80 degs all of a sudden.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3498,"In this case, the entire heatpipe and heatsink is very hot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3498,So I don't really think its a contact issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3498,But I will revalidate it by removing and reapplying a fresh new coat of thermal compound later this week.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3499,"Anyway before I start tearing it apart again, anyone can share their idle and load temps please?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3499,I tested mine in a non-airconditioned room.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3499,Temp as per probe is about 29 degs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3499,"For mine, it idles at 45 minimal and loads to about 80 to 82 degs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3500,"Actually, measuring idle temps might not be the best yardstick."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3500,Most modern laptops will put the fan into fully passive mode and fan spin can be triggered anywhere from high 40s to around 60c depending on the motherboard.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3500,So you can get possibly higher idles on a better paste and lower idles on a poorer paste while the reverse is likely true under load
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3500,So temperatures at the same load will be ideal.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3500,"At the same time, thermal grizzly's viscosity changes at 'out of tube' and steady state after thermal cycling."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3500,"It'll ""dry"" noticeably"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3500,"and that's expected behaviour, overapply is a must."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3500,I do recall Roman Hartung der8auer who's basically thermal grizzly saying somewhere the paste longevity shortens at the high 70s.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3500,"In contrast for notebooks, I'd lean towards moderate or high viscosity pastes like NTH1/NTH2 and Gelid."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3500,High viscosity ones tend to work better with low mounting pressure i.e. laptops
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3501,"Yeah, I did figure that it will be difficult to gauge since it is not going to be an apple to apple compare."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3501,"As for the overapplying, point noted."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3501,"I wasn't aware, and applied a thin layer on it as what I used to do with Arctic MX4."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3504,Intel AC 9260
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3504,Down - 300mbps Up - 600mbps in recent tests on my E585.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3504,Anybody else experiencing such disparity btw up vs down?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3505,Strange their public price and Edu price starts at $660 for E585?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3505,Thought Edu should be cheaper?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3506,I think this depends on your ISP provider.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3506,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3507,What was the down and upload speed generally?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3507,"As Shib mentioned, it could be due to ISP/peak hour speed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3507,"Otherwise, I can only think of the antenna as the other reason."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3508,To update after using it for a few days post the application of the Thermal Grizzly
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3508,", temps seems to peak at 76 degs room temp is 29 degs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3508,"This is when I am gaming on it, so I think the results are really good."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3508,"I believe there is no need for curing with Thermal Grizzly, but it is good to see some very good improvement in thermals."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3508,"Anyway, I did not reapply the Thermal Grizzly although I was planning to previously."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3509,"Normal, throttling on ISP side not on router or laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3509,My Dell laptop about the same on Starhub.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3510,Hi Bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3510,Can I confirm that the maximum link rate of AC9260 is 866Mbps regardless of how high tech the router is?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3511,FYI AMD Ryzen Mobile driver are live.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3512,You need to get those new 160Mbps routers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3512,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3513,U mean the isp knows if you use wireless
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3513,hence will throttle u during speed test ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3513,What nonsense.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3514,Think u meant 160Mhz?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3515,You are correct.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3515,The 160Mhz bandwidth allows 1733Mbps throughput.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3517,finally.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3517,but seeing the notes..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3517,hahah disable hardware acceleration
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3517,Review for the new drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3517,=- install is a breeze.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3517,Make sure DDU first.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3517,=- Green issue on youtube for me when u click on it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3517,However getting a annoying bug where depending on the website.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3517,There will be a suddenly 1 sec flash of all chrome windows
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3517,and if you are running any windows with video open.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3517,the videos will be playing but black screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3517,I guess still disable hardware acceleration

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3519,Windows 10 always indicates that my link rate is 866 Gbps
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3519,what must I do to increase the link rate to AC9260
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3519,advertised 1733Gbps linkrate
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3519,I don't even know how to check if my DIR865 is broadcasting at 160Mhz bandwidth.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3520,You have to check the setting.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3520,I don't think your router is one of the 160Mhz models.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3520,Some vendors used very big numbers to confused the public.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3520,I read there are model that can combine 2 x 80Mhz to perform like 160Mhz.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3520,"Based on what I read, netgear r7800 and future 11ax routers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3520,"You can Google for ""160mhz routers"" to see more models."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3521,the ac9260 max linkrate is 1733.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3521,but its only a 2x2 chip
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3521,right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3521,so i don't think it will achieve the max speed?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3521,u will need it to be 3x3 to reach the 1300 speed..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3521,not forgetting the 160mhz thing...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3521,dir865 is only max 1.3 for the 5ghz and 450 for 2.4ghz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3521,correct me if im wrong

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3527,this E485 is the one that i should be getting.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3527,How do you guys cost save on this one?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3527,I needed some form of normal HDD for basic storage and a SSD fast boot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3527,Upgrade from Lenovo is +70 which i think should be fine right.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3527,Samsung 970
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3527,EVO Plus Series - 250GB PCIe NVMe - M.2 Internal SSD USD 90
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3527,"I guess i probably need a 500GB HDD basic one, which does not need to be high speed."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3527,How about wireless card?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3527,saw some upgrade on this as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3528,"My recommendation is to get the most basic SSD, and 1x 8GB ram."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3528,"While I pad about 737 bucks for m E485, I then spent about 65 bucks on another stick if 8GB, and slightly less than 180 bucks for a 1TB Crucial MX500 SSD SATA3."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3528,"Total damage is less than 1k, may be closer to 980 bucks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3528,"No need to go for NVME SSD since every review out there proved that there is not much improvement over SATA3 SSDs, other than in benchmarks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3529,"thanks man, how do you know which ram is compatible?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3529,"On this E485, does it have space to install 2 HDD?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3530,"Hi all E585 friends, glad to have found this thread."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3530,a
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3530,Can someone show the brand and timing of the original 1x8gb ram?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3530,We have to buy the same ram as much as possible to run dual channel
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3530,right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3530,"I heard ram is very expensive locally now
."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3530,"Where can we buy this ram online, any links?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3530,b
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3530,Is it better to buy our own SSD and install it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3530,"Which SSD should we buy, any links?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3530,Maybe budget about $200 for it...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3530,c
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3530,Can this E585 play Dota 2 on medium or low settings?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3531,Only 1 HDD and 1 m.2 slot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3532,"a If you find it expensive, can just get 2 X 4 GB first."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3532,Down the road than upgrade.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3532,b
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3532,The SSD that Lenovo have as an option that is a NVME SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3532,so it is much expensive than SATA SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3532,Just get the 128GB SSD together with the laptop will do.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3533,"Yes, but there will be spikes when you are low on battery."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3534,"Will the system auto download and install if I do system update, or must we manually download and update ourselves?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3535,You can let OS install the driver but at risk of.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3535,performance and stability.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3535,"Best to install separately, if you let the OS install."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3535,Usually the drivers are for desktop but not notebooks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3536,"Ram is the most basic ones, ie."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3536,DDR4 2400 with CL17 timing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3536,"Even if you get a faster one, it will still run dual channel but run at a slower speed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3536,"SSD, personally I feel its cheaper to buy your own."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3536,"Like I mentioned earlier, you can get a good Crucial MX500 1TB Sata3 at a modest 180 approx."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3536,DOTA2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3536,"performance, I can't really advise since I don't play it."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3539,Should I buy the ram online like newegg?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3539,SSD -
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3539,Ok I saw Crucial MX500 1TB Sata3 on newegg.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3539,"Do we get Form Factor 2.5"" or M.2 2280?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3539,I saw Dota 2 reviews on youtube too
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3539,but it was on the HP Envy laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3540,Depend whether you need warranty or not.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3540,Local more expensive but with warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3540,Overseas less expensive
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3540,but RMA very tedious.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3541,Resolution: Use my monitor's current resolution.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3541,Half way through the second match i will experience spikes / stutter on my screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3541,"Alt-tab will show that the battery has 20+%, less than 30%."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3541,"Once the laptop is plugged in and charging, the spikes / stutter will be gone."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3541,Hope this helps
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3542,You even know 1 full battery = 1.5 game of Dota 2.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3542,You pro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3542,How much ram are you using?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3543,"I am not sure about Newegg, but you can find SSDs at very good prices at Amazon Prime Now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3543,"If its your first purchase, I believe you get further discounts."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3543,SATA3 or M2 depends on what you ordered for your base rig.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3543,"I went with the M2 SSD, so I bought a SATA3 SSD to supplement it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3544,It will stutter/ perform worst on battery because the system is being throttled to try to preserve battery life.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3545,How long does the average battery last
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3546,"Same with gaming laptop, on battery it will shutter."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3546,You can change the setting to maximum performance
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3546,but.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3546,battery will drain out fast.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,Overall it has been great so far for my usage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,Previously installed the Killer 1535 atheros wifi card on it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,"Nearly 1 mth usage, I began to experience overheating on the wifi."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,"The back casing where the wifi card located is super warm, which in turn causing massive network drops at time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,"The network drop is experienced during gaming, it will just lag like no tomorrow, even bringing the laptop near to router is no go."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,"Coincidentally, I have ordered intel 9260ac during that time, maybe it senses I changing it out"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,Changing to ethernet connection will immediately solved all note: powerline network.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,"There's also one strange incident spotted, no matter how strong/weak the signal is, it will reported as 866.7mbps connection speed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,"I guess it is going to uplorry, no intention for rma since buy from taobao and the process is rather troublesome, plus it's only 20ish"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,", just treat that i smoke 2 packs of ciggy lesser, lol."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,"After gotten and installing the intel 9260ac, now connection in my room is around 70% with speed reporting from 300+mbps to 400+mbps depending on the signal strength."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,Overall speed is pretty stable compare the atheros on my own feel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,Moving the laptop closer to router will get 866.7mbps connection.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,Have not tested on the 160mhz settings since the router is a singtel oem one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,Changing to starhub one soon as I recontract my fibre tv for free 2 years fibre Internet and will given Linksys router.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,Then maybe i will try to see if I can configure for the 160mhz.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,"Before the official amd support on mobile ryzen released, I had installed the amd v1000 drivers, forced installation of the latest adrenaline driver up to 19.2.2."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,So far they been performing well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,With only rarely occasional green screen on youtube.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,Anyway i did install the chipset driver prior using forced installed graphic driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,"And oh ya, i forced installed RX Vega, not vega 8, vega 10 or vega 11."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,"However with the release of 19.2.3 it did installed smoothly on the dot for the graphics ddu b4 that of coz, but youtube green screen become quite prominent."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,So i have to disable hw acceleration on chrome.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,Maybe it's the first official release somemore
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,"it's considered beta, so likely it will mature like a fine wine."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,"Overall laptop idle temp around 44°C on non aircon and 40°C on aircon super low temp, 18°C on aircon, workplace as my boss is pengiun."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,On load maximum experience at non aircon is 85°C on stress test 2hr and 77°
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,C.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,"Load At aircon did not measure, but should be better."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,Gaming wise after that I have not tried since super busy on work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,"But overall, loved it very much."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,You can say this is the best lappy I ever owned.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,Next up will try to repaste the thermal paste and try the mobile ryzen master hack found on reddit to play around with tdp envelope when I have time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,Cheers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,P.S.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,To bro bluestone27
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,"your pm full, thanks for the interest on the killer 1535 wifi card,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,"since it get overheating issue, i not giving away anymore."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3549,Thanks for your interest.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3550,Thanks for the long update ;p
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3550,"My Ryzen 5 e585, so far so good."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3550,Moving to AC9260 was a good move.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3550,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3551,TQ Dragon for the review.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3551,"Like you, I do not own a 160mhz router."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3551,"Therefore, since my router is 80mhz router, each of my router stream stream is capped at 433mhz and therefore my Intel 9260 also max out at 2stream"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3551,x 433
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3551,Mbps = 866 mbps
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3551,"Regarding the influence of heat on my Speed test throughput - my observation is that when my laptop is first nice and cool upon starting, 9260 has good throughput."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3551,"After about 10minites in a non air-conditioned room, the laptop will be hot , at this point the throughput will drop to about half for me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3551,It is surprising that heat has an effect on wifi card throughput.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3552,"Strange, my current driver was newer than AMD website, 18.12."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,"Alright today starhub came and install the fibre tv, ont & linksys"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,E8100 router.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,However cannot find 160mhz settings despite online
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,says it is 160mhz 1.733gbps capable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,"Strangely, intel 9260ac seems to hate this router."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,"In my room, handphone show full bar but laptop jumping up and down."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,"Speedtest starhub server on handphone, near 300mbps up and down."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,Speedtest on lappy ranging too much 150mbps+ to 250mbps+ download
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,and now I kena the upload bug 45mbps+ to 60mbps+.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,"Bringing laptop near to the EA8100 router, connected speed also jumping 500mbps+ to 866.7mbps."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,Speedtest also same bug on upload locked at 60mbps+.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,Lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,Dunno what to do liaoz.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,EDIT:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,"oh ya to mentioned this, my office 250mbps fibre line using tp-link router does not have this issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,"Up and down stable at 250mbps+ starhub, also network connection speed all the way 886.7mbps."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3553,it's business plan.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3554,Hi bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3554,could it be possible that your office has a lower temp and the wifi card is not as hot?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3555,I tried using outside my office non aircon for a period of time and connected speed still 866.7mbps and speedtest still managed to get my office speed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3555,Btw my office is a small single unit high roof with a 2nd floor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3555,"2nd floor split into halfwooden partition , one for office, one for recreation and smoking corner."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3555,Router is generally place in the centre of 2nd floor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3555,Edit: So likely my intel 9260ac don't like linksys EA8100.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3555,"Play with a lot of settings on the router liaoz, change channel la, put to ac only, set to 80mhz la."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3555,"Same, no solve."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3555,"At least the singtel oem won't have such issue, but heck it's okie"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3555,just need to wait for my new powerline adapter and just connect to powerline ethernet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3555,My current one i used it for fibre tv.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3555,P.S.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3555,I staying at my sister house and starhub
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3555,i'm paying for it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3555,So very hard for me to lay cable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3555,Waiting my 2 room flat singles scheme to be built in 2 years time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3556,I have the same problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3556,e585+
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3556,9260ac+ea8100.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3556,dlink 868: ~400mbps.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3556,linksys ea8100:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3556,~150mbps dload below 100mbps upload was worse at ~90mbps until starhub tech adjusted some settings
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3556,but this was the best he could do
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3556,Many others are complaining about the ea8100 too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3556,"Btw, ea8100 is not 160mhz capable, it is multiple 80mhz capable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3556,9260ac works with 160mhz capable routers for max performance
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3556,but there are very few such routers and very expensive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3556,I have an Acer with 9260
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3556,"and it's getting ~400+mbps from ea8100, which is interesting."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3557,Thanks bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3557,So that confirms my guts feeling that the intel 9260ac hate the linksys ea8100.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3557,"Oh well i can live with it, no issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3557,Will be mainly connecting to powerline ethernet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3558,"thing is, see my last sentence an old acer upgraded with 9260 works fine with ea8100..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3558,so may be the combo of e585
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3558,+
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3558,9260ac+ea8100 not working well together... hope someone else with this combo can also chip in to confirm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3559,Probably e585 only compatible with certain WLAN card not to mentioned the driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3560,Oh my mistake lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3560,Missed out that sentence.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3560,"Well at the meantime, i can just use powerline ethernet at home, so not much of a biggie issue for now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3560,Got time
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3560,then i try find solution for it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3560,Going to be busy soon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3561,Think the AC9260 probably optimized under Intel chipset...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3561,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3562,TQ bro for detailed info.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3562,This affirms my suspicion that there are multiple variables involved.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3563,but my e585+9260 gets ~400mbps from dlink 868...

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3565,Excuse
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3565,"the posts please, because it says someone pm me"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3565,so I am replying
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3565,but it says I have to make 10 posts to reply

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3566,", sorry, please ignore"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3567,"Thanks, watzup ken."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3567,I shall sign  up for amazon prime now now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3568,wonder if this samsung ssd works?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3568,It's about 230SGD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3569,screen upgrade.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3569,For the adventurous.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3570,"Yes the E485/585 has a SATA connector, check to see if yours has the dummy HDD included."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3570,Alternatively just get a NVMe or M.2 drive instead.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3571,those 2 panels are already existing configuration options from Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3571,No point upgrading unless new 1440p or 4k panels come out in the future.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3572,"To be honest, I won't bother upgrading the panels because the integrated graphics is mostly capable of gaming at 720p to 1080p max."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3572,"A higher resolution panel will also put more strain on the battery, i.e. reduced battery life."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3573,Just get the ips type when you configure.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3573,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3574,New drivers available.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3574,Cheers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3575,New drivers doesn't fix the chrome issues still haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3576,It seems to fix for me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3576,Did not experience on chrome for now DDU-ed installation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3577,Thanks Hellos.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3578,"Thanks, good observation"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3579,"say, budget limitation 3 choose 2:
1."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3579,"Ryzen 5 +$90
2."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3579,upgrade RAM to 8GB?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3579,"+$60
3."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3579,"no HDD -$60, 125GB m2 +$70?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3579,Anyone went for this and later put in yr
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3579,own SATA3 SSD 240GB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3579,+$50?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3579,*. Screen upgrade to FHD +$25; cheap.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3580,If you are ordering E485 and only order M2 SSD without additional HDD you won't get the HDD mounting cage and connector.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3580,So you can't later add a SATA3 SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3580,You have order the cage and connector thereafter as spare parts.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3580,Some others have indicated these parts can be bought online.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3580,For E585 the mounting cage comes along with the machine even when 2nd HDD is not ordered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3581,"wow, good info for potential buyer to take note."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3581,"If buy HDD + SSD config, where does the OS/Win10 reside?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3582,What the general view of E485?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3582,I only read the first and last few pages of this long thread.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3582,"Price is very nice, I customize one that came up to $815."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3582,"Customized specs below, is this sufficient for general desktop, office apps, youtube, school use?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3582,Any comments appreciated.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3582,Is the Ryzen 3 CPU fast enough?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3582,"If only M2 SSD as second drive, can it still start or must I choose something for first drive?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3583,The group here did not get conclusive evidence on this maybe because no one has ordered both yet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3583,I assumed OS would be on SSD using common sense
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3583,but I now accept that common sense cannot be applied to this model since we found out cage is not included.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3584,Ryzen 3 should suffice
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3584,but I generally tries to buy the highest CPU speed I can afford.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3584,Other parts can be upgraded easily.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3584,CPU is more challenging to upgrade.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3584,I bought ryzen 7.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3584,Edit
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3584,: I just noticed you are using the promo code AMD19 that gives you a $200 discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3584,Not sure if there are better promo codes now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3584,A month or so back there is a SGNIGHT promo code or something similar which will appear after a certain hour in the night.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3584,There is also DBS/POSB promotion which you can find under the SALES option on the website.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3584,Lastly if you have a student in the family the education promo code may also give better discount of up to $300.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3585,:AMD Radeon Vega 3 Graphics is a separate Graphic processor with it own core & memory or its like Intel 600  integrated in the main processor ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3586,Integrated if I understand your question correctly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3587,"Hi guys,  can the e585 use a M.2 2280 1TB PCI-Express 3.0 x4 3D NAND internal ssd?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3588,"I don't know if this is a recent thing, but I ordered my E485 with only the NVME drive, but it came with the 2.5 inch hard disk cage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3588,I only got my laptop slightly more than a month back.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3589,I believe it should support.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3590,"The price jump from R3 to R5 is quite big, but I feel it is worth it from a performance standpoint."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3590,"Storage wise, you need to have at least 1 drive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3590,"So in your case if you chose SSD, then you don't have to select a mechanical drive drive 1 in this case."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3590,"Also if you are not going to upgrade the ram on your own, it is recommended that you select 4GB x 2, instead of a single 8GB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3590,"If you buy later in the night, I am not sure what time exactly, you can use SGNIGHT code that should give you 50 bucks more discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3591,Take note Ryzen 3 is dual core while Ryzen 5 is quad core.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3592,"Thanks guys for all the good info, didn't know got so many code, is the education code public?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3592,Yes the $ jump from Ryzen 3 to 5 is something to think about.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3592,"Another one on my mind is Acer Swift 3, looks sleeker but also more expensive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3593,U can check out the HP 14-cm0109au laptop which also uses Ryzen 3 and Radeon Vega 3 Graphics but at a much lower price..

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3596,The difference is only an extra $50 compared to SGNIGHT.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3596,So don't feel too hard up if you don't have one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3596,Once in a while the site will offer ram on discount that make the purchase even more value-for-money.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3596,I made use of both the education promo code and ram discount to get my E585 ryzen 7 at slightly below $900 with 8gb RAM.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3596,It was during the christmas and CNY period when they really offered good deals.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3597,I thought someone on this thread mentioned the HDD cage was missing in the E485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3598,"Yeah, I saw it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3598,"Though there is no confirmation if they omitted it accidentally, or deliberately."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3599,Anyone using a type-c usb hub as a desktop replicator with this Lenovo notebook?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3599,Will the power from the power adaptor be able to pass through the hub and reach the notebook?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3601,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3602,And expensive too.....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3602,look like
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3602,those cheap usb hub won't do the job.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3603,If you were to buy 8GB RAM.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3603,Does it come in 2 sticks 4GB + 4GB?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3603,All Ryzen capable of dual channels RAM access?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3603,so a 4G+4G will be faster than a single stick 8G?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3604,If you are ordering from the Lenovo website they have option for you to choose 2x4gb or single 8gb.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3604,The general consensus in this thread is to buy 2x4gb to make sure of the dual channel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3605,Uses Display Link right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3605,mai la.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3606,"Yes, ordering from Lenovo website."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3606,"sorry, need some spoon feeding."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3606,Cant find the 4+4 options on the Configurable Components page.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3606,Only have 4 then 8.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3606,Or did you guys buy 4GB part on the checkout page?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3607,"If you are not planning to open it up to upgrade on your own, then best to select the 2x 4GB option."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3607,"Yes, it will be faster with the ram running in dual channels."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3608,I can try this tomorrow.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3609,Please help to test today....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3609,Lazada got sales this weekend.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3609,Fingers itchy want to press....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3610,I noticed they remove the 4 X 2 configuration.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3610,Either get 4GB or 8 GB depending on your budget.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3610,Once laptop arrive than just add another stick.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3611,Thanks for checking up the site and reply.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3611,Looks like they removed that option during IT Show.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3611,"Also prices are nothing special for IT Show; from earlier Jan 19 posts, people are seeing the same price even slightly lower."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3611,Hope they restore the 4G+4G after the show.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3612,Tested and it works for me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3612,"I did not try out the HDmi connection, but I was able to charge and use the USB 3.0 port on the adapter."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3613,Thank you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3614,Oh yea.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3614,Bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3614,Sharp eye.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3614,I didn't notice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3614,They also removed the 8x2 option.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3614,They also removed the 500gb SSD option..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3615,Reading thru the reviews is scary.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3615,"How come so many ppl got the blue screen of death Crash, even on simple task like watching youtube?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3615,Is this because of Ryzen or motherboard or drivers?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3615,Some of you guys have updated drivers & bios.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3615,Have these 2 eliminated the BSoD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3616,"Graphic driver issue, however AMD mention some notebook will face such issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3616,For me if I got chance to play with Asus AMD ryzen laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3616,See whether is it really certain laptop have such issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3617,I've never encountered any BSOD so far.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3617,I don't use YouTube often.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3617,"Mostly for work, playing some lighter games and watching movies on Netflix/ iTunes."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3618,"Watch youtube everyday, never happened to me, no problems at all."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3618,I simply use AMD official drivers and turned off chrome's hardware acceleration.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3619,Is this the thread with no hdd cage?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3619,It is a Lenovo A485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3620,Oh dear.....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3620,A vs E.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3620,My bad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3621,so far updated all to latest no more bsod.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3621,just remember to disable hw acceleration for chrome if u use.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3622,Thanks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3622,Realise that A485 has Ryzen Pro 3 2300U; it is shown with pricing but not selectable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3622,Not ready yet?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3623,Maybe not ready yet or OOS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3624,"HP Ryzen 3, $499."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3624,"HP Notebook - 14-cm0109au / 4GB / 128 SSD / 14"" /"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3624,WIN10.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3624,Lowest cost 'gaming' notebook?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3625,It is very cheap for the specs indeed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3625,"But beware that in order to get to this price, surely there must be serious corners being cut."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3625,"Even when AMD definitely charges a lot less than Intel for mobile processors, it is not easy to get to 499 that comes with a SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3626,"Lazada sold by seller who called HP, using HP logo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3627,Zero info on what kind / model of SSD it is.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3627,"Given price, it may be M.2 SATA, which is alot slower than the NVMe M.2 drive of the Thinkpad E485/E585."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3627,Also TN panel for screen and only 1 yr standard off-site warranty for this HP laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3627,Hmm
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3628,SSD is SATA.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3628,LCD is 1333 resolution meaning non full HD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3628,4GB ram.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3628,"Price is suspicious, any link?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3628,Up your budget get either E485 or Asus
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3628,X505ZA.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3629,It is on Lazada at $499...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3629,"think it is a glossy display, but price is cheap."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3630,"It's up to you to decide, if it were me I will go for this instead."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3631,That's why I mentioned there will be serious cost cut to get to this price point.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3631,"But to be honest, it's still very good in value to me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3631,"At this price point and in the Intel camp, you likely will get a Pentium Silver laptop with 64/128GB eMMC, and not even a SATA3 SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3632,Later today at 1pm there is a flash sale..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3632,the price is most likely gonna be < $499...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3633,"Nope, I'm wrong..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3633,the price remains the same at $499..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3634,Now Lazada has HP discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3634,If use $6 discount will become 496.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3634,If can buy another item then can get $50 discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3635,Oh ya hor.. r u thinking of getting it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3636,Nope.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3636,I kaypoh only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3636,Owned the E585 which I already seldom use.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3637,Lol ok..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3637,hey do u know if Intel Pentium N5000 quad-core is better than Ryzen 3 dual core for a laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3638,My E585 is a Ryzen 7
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3638,and I have not used Ryzen 3 yet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3638,I do have a mini PC running N5000 quad-core that I used for causal surfing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3638,I have no issue using it for internet browsing and watching stream or video.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3638,For work wise like using Excel I would use a better processor like my E585 notebook.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3638,It will run faster.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3638,I have three setup at home.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3638,"Daily-use like internet surfing and you-know-what, I use my mini PC."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3638,Low powered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3638,Thus can be 24x7.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3638,If gaming I turn on my desktop with ryzen 5 2400g.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3638,For mobility I uses my E585 notebook.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3639,Icic.......
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3640,"I don't have the answer either, but my gut feel is that the Ryzen 3 is definitely faster even though it is missing 2 physical core to compete."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3640,"Even though the Pentium Silver chips have 4 cores, they are typically limited to run at 10W, shared between the CPU and GPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3640,"Assuming equal power rating, the Ryzen core will still be quite a bit faster, running alongside with a fairly powerful Vega 3 GPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3640,You can get a good indication by checking say an Intel i3 vs a Pentium Silver comparison.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3641,Oh r u saying that a Ryzen 3 is as fast as an Intel i3?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3642,Ryzen 3 2200U is more or less faster than i3.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3642,CPU is one aspect
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3642,but the VEGA graphics is definitely better than Intel UHD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3643,Icic..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3643,thanks guys..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3644,"Hey, just updated to the latest version of Chrome 73.0.3683.75."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3644,That seems to solve the facebook and youtube video problems.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3644,No longer need to disable hardware acceleration or
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3644,the ANGLE D3D9 workarounds.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3645,I also suspected could be chrome issue not graphic driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3645,"For those who after update still encounter issue, suggest."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3645,reinstall Chrome from fresh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3646,Which is why I don't bother enabling hardware acceleration.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3646,I am one that don't update driver if its working fine for me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3646,"However Chrome updates automatically, which tends to break or cause issues from time to time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3647,"True, same for me my Chrome the auto update is disabled."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3647,I only update once a while or when there is a big version.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3648,"Guys ,
I'm thinking of getting a E585 / A485."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3648,Want to customize it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3648,So a few questions.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3648,In A484 1st and 2nd hard disk are SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3648,What's the difference between 2 SSD vs 1x
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3648,Bigger capactity SSD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3648,Is A485 the better model and better wifi chips?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3649,"A485 is the better model not only the WIFI, the chassis,
ports and etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3649,are are much better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3649,A485 also have docking port if you intend to get a docking station.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3649,SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3649,wise recommended just get a m.2 SSD minimum 128GB for OS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3649,will do.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3649,"No really recommended to get a big SSD for data storage, a HDD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3649,will be much better over SSd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3650,Ryzen3000 notebooks have started to appear in the market.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3651,Yes but none in local stores.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3651,Lenovo there are a few models and Asus FX505DY
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3651,at the moment.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3651,No Thinkpad based on the newer chip.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3652,Just a heads up..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3652,HP on LazMall is gonna have Lazada B'day Sale on 27 mar..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3652,HP 14-cm0109au will be going for $4?4...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3653,I get a sense it will be 494.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3653,"In any case, it is already super good value t 499."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3654,Ya v wu hua...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3654,they had it at $499 $494 for a short while recently also..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3654,r u getting anything on Lazada's bday sale on the 27th?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3655,Latest GPU drivers are out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3656,I guess this is the most value for money laptop now?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3656,specs looks not bad for light use.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3657,E585 Silicone Keyboard protector in case
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3657,anyone else needs:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3657,And backlit keyboard:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3658,"For now that is the only cheap, other options are:
Asus X505ZA $749 Ryzen 5."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3658,"256GB SSD, 4GB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3658,Lenovo have four new Ideapad with Ryzen 3XXX series
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3658,The Ideapad L340 it is using 5400rpm HDD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3658,so I won't recommend it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3658,The C340 is a 2 in1 but that model is above $1k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3659,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think the backlight of the keyboard works on the E485 and E585 even though it works on the E580 when the same keyboard is installed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3660,I see.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3660,"The description says for e585, but I havent tried myself."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3660,Those interested prob better to confirm with seller first.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3661,"To be honest, I am not sure if a backlight keyboard is required for everyone."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3661,"In the past when I need to see what I am typing, the backlight does help."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3661,"Otherwise, I think it is just for aesthetics."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3661,I rather not have it and get a slightly better battery life for this laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3662,"I wonder why even at such a low price, this laptop doesn't enjoy gd sales..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3662,could it be bcos the majority of the general public would still rather stick to good old Intel chips?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3663,anyone received the Hp promotion laptop from lazada?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3664,1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3664,design.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3664,2.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3664,weight
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3665,still holding back due to the blue screen issue i read earlier in the page.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3666,this issue doesn't exist anymore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3666,at least for me..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3666,with the latest gpu drivers
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3667,I've been using it for close to 2 months now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3667,No issues with BSOD to date.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3668,Most folks out there that are not tech savvy will generally prefer Intel since AMD is unheard of to them.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3668,"Moreover this deal is not widely available, i.e. you can't find it in stores, so unless you frequently comb through the ThinkPad series online, you may not notice it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3669,This may be true since people nowadays will prefer a laptop that is paper thin.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3669,"Design wise, you can't really ding them for the price."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3670,"Yes, most will buy Intel over AMD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3670,Some have never heard of AMD especially those who are not into DIY.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3670,But my two cents is that there is a bad perspective about AMD that it is hot and slow.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3671,"Yes, and this group of people who are more tech savvy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3671,"But they feel to realized that the tide has turned and its now Intel that is running hot, especially the high end models."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3671,"At the lower end and low power models, they are still doing well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3671,This goes to show how hard they have pushed their aging chips just to keep up with competition.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3672,True;.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3672,"Intel U series no issue especially with heat, however it's performance"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3672,especially the TDP still varies on manufacturer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3672,Intel H series wise this 45 watt CPU can reach 90 degrees on load.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3672,especially for i7/i9 6 core CPU are even hotter.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3672,"I am using Dell G3 i7 6 core,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3672,when gaming/load the laptop is like.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3672,a aeroplane.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3672,Waiting for a decent AMD Ryzen H gaming laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3672,than I change.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3672,"As the first AMD Ryzen H gaming laptop, it is cited that AMD CPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3672,runs much cooler than Intel counterpart.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3673,Oh lol i was actually talking abt the HP 14-cm0109au Ryzen 3 laptop..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3674,Thinkpad E485 Review
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3674,and they recommend it:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3674,Sadly it seems the dual channel configuration Lenovo have removed it so not only SG.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3674,"The keyboard backlight, to me since it is E series such option not available."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3674,Anyway not really useful unless you are typing in the dark.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3674,"If you can't see the keyboard, can always up the LCD brightness to illuminate the keyboard."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3675,Is this RAM option removed but still got 2 slots or new motherboard with single Sodimm ram slot?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3675,Ryzen can ran faster with dual chn.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3676,Two slots.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3677,2 slots should still be there.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3677,Normally they will not change the layout of the motherboard.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3678,Hi all I am looking to get a new laptop is the e585 a good buy?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3678,Laptop is for every day use such as surf net and watching video.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3678,Is there any major issues face by users who own this laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3679,Very heavy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3679,Thats all
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3680,Thx for reply.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3680,Weight shouldn't be a problem since I don't carry it around.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3680,How about this model the ideal pad L340 when compare with the e585?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3680,the only difference I see is the hdd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3681,It will handle most tasks easily.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3681,"Weight aside at approx 2.1 KG which is not heavy to me, it is getting more and more stable since its launch last year."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3681,I've been using the E485 which is essentially the same
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3681,"but with a smaller monitor, and its been very stable for me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3681,"Compared to an Intel laptop of similar class/ build, this probably loses out in terms of battery life."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3681,But GPU is more than 2x if not 3x faster.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3682,Despite it comes with the new AMD Ryzen mobile processor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3682,Thinkpad still wins hand down as: - LCD panel the ideapad model comes with non-IPS panel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3682,as compare with E585.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3682,"I owned Ideapad without IPS panel, the screen quality is poor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3682,"- 5400rpm as primary HDD, Windows 10 will crawl"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3682,Laptop with SSD would be ideal to run Win 10.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3682,"Build, keyboard, trackpad Thinkpad is the better buy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3682,If you ask if there is E485/E585 refresh with the newer AMD mobile processor?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3682,Unfortunately no news except T495/X395
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3682,but these are premium Thinkpad so will cost above $1k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3683,"Thx, it's good to know that it's getting stable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3683,Is there any heat issues with the e485?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3684,Thx for the detail info.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3684,Looks like will give up this model.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3684,How about the IdeaPad s340 as compared to e585?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3684,I read through the thread on t495/
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3684,x395
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3684,it's coming out in June
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3684,not sure if I am willing to wait that long
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3684,cos my current laptop hdd is gone.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3685,What is your usage?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3685,Work?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3685,Light gaming or?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3685,Thinkpad E485/E585 still a better and balanced choice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3685,The next model would be E490 Intel but more expensive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3686,Use mainly for surfing and watching video online.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3686,Might use it for some light gaming if got time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3686,Looking to find one that can last 4-5 yrs
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3686,cos
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3686,I don't change pc very fast.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3687,"E485/E585 fits your usage, opt for three years warranty than"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3687,you are good to go.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3687,"Unless you have bigger budget than go for T series,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3687,Intel U series with MX150.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3687,"Else the E490 which I shared, pricey"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3687,but that is if you prefer Intel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3688,Anyone knows the speed or lanes of both the pcie interface for E485/585?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3688,"I can only see on A485 which states Gen3 x2, aka 16Gbs/s."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3689,For m.2 slot?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3690,"Yup, just wanted to make sure not buying any higher speed nvme that will be bottled neck by the pcie speed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3691,For A485 is 16GB/S according to Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3692,There is no reason to limit what SSD to get just because it can't run at full speed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3692,"The reality is that most high speed NVMe drive can never sustain full speed even if it is not bandwidth limited, especially one in a laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3692,"Also based on your own usage, will you consistently make it run at full speed?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3692,With SSD prices currently very affordable
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3692,", I doubt you will save much from buying a NVMe drive that runs at PCIEx2 vs x4."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3693,"you actually do, e.g. Crucial P1 1TB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3693,~$105
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3693,USD vs Samsung Evo Plus 1TB $250 USD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3693,"So if the latter is crippled by the interface bandwidth, no point spending on it right..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3694,I think it is not a good comparison when you are choosing one of the lowest end SSD vs a top end SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3694,There are SSDs that don't come with a steep Samsung premium.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3694,"If I look at the pricing for Crucial P1 on Amazon Prime, its going around 144 bucks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3694,"While if you look at Lazada, you can find 1TB NVMe drives for close to 200 bucks before any discounts applied."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3694,"For example, if you look up Transcend MTE220S 1TB, its 199 bucks before rebates and coupon discounts."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3695,bought this for my dad at $629 with the 72 hour coupon
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3695,"Comes with the latest ryzen 5 3500u processor,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3695,"downside for this model is you don't have the option to change to ssd, but it's fine, after the 1 year warranty i will swap the hard disk to ssd if needed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3696,You can add a m.2 SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3697,I believe no issue to add on with another 8gb ram?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3697,Price is really attractive for latest Ryzen 3000.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3698,"Yes, one soldered and one slot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3699,This is great pricing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3699,And its quite rare to see laptops with ODD nowadays.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3700,The other disadvantage about the L340 other than HDD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3700,"Is the display, take note the LCD panel is not IPS."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3700,So expect average picture quality.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3701,For the T490..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3701,the 8gb ram is soldered on.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3701,What if I add another 8gb ram will it be faster or more efficient?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3701,Is 1 stick 16GB ram good?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3701,Don't know why lenovo don't offer 2x8Gb..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3702,Depends on your usage I guess.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3703,"wah, Ryzen 5 + 8GB at below $700 is a value buy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3703,Yr dad can play games with this system.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3704,"Hi guys, Just want to clarify."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3704,Q1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3704,What kind of battery life are you getting with the E485 and E585?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3704,"Usage am looking at is mainly surfing, playing videos via vlc, coding and using spreadsheets, word processing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3704,Q2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3704,"If let's say the battery life is only 4 hours with the above scenario, is it possible to use a USB PowerDelivery powerbank when on the go?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3704,If so what powerbanks would you recommend?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3704,Q3 Would it be better to wait for the newer ryzen 3000 mobile for battery life?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3704,See some info putting it at 12 hours spec
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3705,"If you want longer battery life, consider A485 as that model the."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3705,battery can swap out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3705,If battery exhausted can just snap in a new one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3705,"Powerbank for such laptop, normal powerbank are not usable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3705,You need this type of charger.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3705,It's pricey
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3705,but if you get cheap and not compatible powerbank.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3705,You may risk damaging the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3706,"I can't find any review of Ryzen 3000 mobile notebooks to date, though someone has recently compared gaming performance between Ryzen 2500U & the 3500U on YouTube."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3706,The FPS gain is at most 10%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3706,"Ryzen 3000 improvements from the 12nm node possibly slightly lower cache latency, +100mhz base & 100-200mhz"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3706,"Max boost, some power savings."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3706,Hopefully the high idle power consumption of the Ryzen 2000 mobile has been alleviated partially with the 12nm node.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3706,I say partially cos it will probably take more than a half node shrink to fix high idle power consumption.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3706,Intel just have much more experience in minimizing CPU idle power consumption over the years.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3706,OEMs generally over-quote laptop battery life.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3706,"If I were to hazard a guess, a 6 hours practical battery life given the same battery capacity. ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3707,Thinkpad E495/E595 have been announced.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3708,These are the specs I choose for either e485/e585
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3708,"AMD Ryzen 7 2700U Processor 6MB Cache, up to 3.80GHz."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3708,"14""/15.6"" FHD 1920x1080, IPS, Anti-glare."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3708,8GB DDR4 2400MHz SODIMM.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3708,AMD Radeon
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3708,RX Vega 10 Graphics.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3708,"500GB Hard Disk Drive, 7200RPM, 2.5"", SATA3"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3708,"256GB Solid State Drive, M.2 2280, NVMe, Opal 2.0"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3708,Is this alright?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3708,What's your recommendation?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3708,Are there any big difference between the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3709,2700U only have 200 more mhz in Base & Boost clocks respectively.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3709,It also has faster integrated graphics.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3709,"Besides these 2 factors, they share the exact feature set."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3709,2700U vs 2500u makes a small difference in games Say 10-15%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3709,"In non-gaming usage CPU intensive, the difference is single digit."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3709,Just make sure that the 8GB is 2 sticks dual channel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3709,"Imho, 12-16GB dual channel is better as 8gb is really the bare minimum nowadays."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3709,And having memory in Dual channel makes a big difference for Ryzens.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3710,"On paper, Ryzen 7 is faster, i.e. CPU with higher clockspeed and more beefy GPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3710,"In reality when both CPU and GPU are under load, both Ryzen 5 and 7 will throttle due to insufficient power and in most cases, a lack of cooling as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3710,These ultra low power CPU are rated at 15W and is able to boost temporarily to 25W.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3710,That's not a lot of power to share between the CPU and GPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3710,The situation is the same for Intel's ultra low power chips.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3711,Good to go.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3711,Between 5 and 7 is the clockspeed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3711,Remember to buy additional ram for the laptop to take advantage of the dual channel which benefit the Ryzen APU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3712,In what cases will both CPU and GPU be under load?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3712,What can be done to stop the throttle due to insufficient power?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3713,Thx guys.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3713,Will it be better if I change the 8GB ram to a 12GB 4+8 DDR4 2400MHz SoDIMM?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3713,If the E495/E595 is coming out soon it could be better to wait for these two models?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3714,"It's a minor improvement slightly faster, better idle power draw."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3714,Not sure if Lenovo will be changing other hardware components on the E495/E595.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3714,The new ideaPad with Ryzen 3xxx are already out for online order.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3714,"However, no customization is allowed & the default configuration is lacking on those."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3715,Might as well wait awhile more.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3715,Since it's already appearing the newer models.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3716,I use this xiaomi pd powerbank for Macbook and my Friend use it for his ThinkPad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3716,Cheap and works extremely well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3716,Was previously using Anker 30W
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3716,26.8k
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3716,Mah powerbank.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3717,True but pricing maybe different.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3717,Older model will be cheap while newer can be more expensive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3718,Actually not insufficient power but the TDP limitation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3718,Since AMD Ryzen 2500U is ultra low wattage with TDP set at
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3718,15 watt minimum while the max is 25 watt.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3718,"Under load like games, 3D application and etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3718,than the turbo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3718,will kick in than the APU TDP will rise to 25 watt.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3718,Not sure in the BIOS whether the AMD SenseMI can be disable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3718,or not.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3718,Intel is Intel Speedstep while AMD is SenseMI
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3718,"However even if it is possible, it will impact performance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3718,Best to leave it on.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3719,skipping the new 495/595 since this is just zen+..not even zen2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3720,"Gaming, which is also one of the main reasons to choose a APU over a CPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3720,"Depends on the manufacturer, some allow you to turn the TDP up for Intel, not sure for AMD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3721,"If you need a laptop soon, then personally I don't see the need to wait."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3721,The 3xxx series is not going to be a game changer in terms of performance as compared to the current 2xxx series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3722,"Most manufacturers will not allow you to tamper with the TDP, especially on a laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3722,The reason is because the cooling solution for a laptop is made for the TDP that they set.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3722,By allowing for a permanent TDP increase by user means it may overheat.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3722,"There may be ways to do it, but definitely not something that is covered under warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3722,"So far, I've only seen those smaller China manufacturers such as Chuwi, Oanda, Cube, etc, allowing users to increase the TDP."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3723,That is true.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3724,Thx all for the helpful advice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3724,Is the 12GB 4+8 DDR4 2400MHz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3724,SoDIMM consider a 2 sticks ram dual channel?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3725,Better avoid such combination.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3725,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3726,"Avoid this configuration, different size the RAM won't perform very well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3726,Worse performance may hit or crash.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3726,Just get 8GB than when you get the laptop than add another stick.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3726,Don't know why Lenovo had to remove the RAM combo option.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3727,Thx would have gone for that configuration.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3727,Yes it would be great if they have the ram combo option.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3727,Any recommendations where I can get another stick?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3727,Have never add ram myself before hope it's not too hard.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3728,Thks for all the replies guys.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3728,Glad to have got confirmation about the usb pd powerbank notion.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3728,For battery life we can use a scaling factor just to estimate.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3728,"If recall correctly, lenovo specs a 9hr battery life, user reviews puts it approx 4.5 hrs.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3728,So a 50% factor may be a good starting estimate.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3728,The new spec for the e495 puts it at 13hrs...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3728,so hopefully this translates to at least 6.5hours..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3728,"As for dual channel ram, there seems to be a bit of mix advice going on here..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3728,"So if we spec a single 8gb ram, how should we source the next 8gb ram?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3728,Same brand?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3728,"Or is it better to just order the 4gb ram, sell it & then buy 2 x 8Gb ram?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3729,"Doubt anyone will want to buy 4GB, the resale for such size is very little."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3729,"Best would be 8GB than get another stick, brand wise need not be the same"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3729,"but the size, specs and speed must be the same."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3729,Can get from SLS or Lazada Convergent Store:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3730,It will run in Flex mode.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3730,4gb + 4gb in dual channel & the last 4gb in the bigger stick in single channel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3730,"If the 12 GB 8+4 configuration is provided straight from Lenovo, there won't be any compatibility issues"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3730,"Ideally, matched sticks same size & same memory chips is still better."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3730,"If you use 2 unmatched sticks of RAM eg: 8gb from Lenovo, 8GB from elsewhere, there is a small chance of it not running in Dual channel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3730,"In the worse case scenario, it may also have bootup issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3730,Memory compatibility for AMD is generally not as good as Intel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3730,"To play safe & save money, get the minimum 4GB option & buy 2x8GB or 2x16GB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3730,Matched pair separately from other online retailers to upgrade yourself.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3730,"Of cos, the 4GB stick will have little to no resale value."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3731,"Can I ask, how's the Ubuntu or other Linux distro compatibility with AMD chips?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3731,Been thinking of getting an affordable thinkpad to run Ubuntu.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3731,Posted from PCWX using Mi A2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3732,any thoughts on the ryzen5 lenovo yoga 530?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3733,Some modification to Grub is required for Linux to boot without errors..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3733,"Btw, how's the battery life of your Mi A2?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3734,Got another E485 for my frd...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3734,Really cheap and good buy...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3735,Thanks! will look through the links.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3735,"The A2, it's currently running 2 active SIM card and got it during 2018's Black Friday."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3735,Morning 7am 100%
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3735,till 3pm is about 10-20%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3735,For me I'm satisfied as it's a budget mid-range phone.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3735,performance is starting to show slow-ness.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3735,Might reset it soon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3736,"guys.. those who did a clean install of windows, how do you get office installed again??"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3737,Can download the installer from MS Office website.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3737,There is 365 and the Office 2019.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3737,Older version of Officer MS website should have them.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3738,"I just got my E585, on stock paste with 1.52 BIOS the CPU do not go beyond 80C with a room temperature of around 29C."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3738,This is only with a CPU load and not a combined CPU/GPU load.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3738,Seems like the BIOS throttles the CPU once it reaches 80C.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3739,How is the performance of E585?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3739,"Saw reviews in Lenovo website, someone feedback this notebook is slow even with SSD option."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3740,Thanks for sharing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3740,I believe CPU will drop to base clock if not lower when it hits 80 to 82 degs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3740,"Even with combined CPU/GPU load, it will throttle heavily due to TDP constraint."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3741,The notebook is not slow with the SSD M2 NVME option.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3741,I got a Samsung PM981 in mine but components can change based on Lenovo's whim.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3741,"On A/C power, it's slightly faster than my old i7-3770 desktop from 2012 in CPU-Z single & multiple threaded benchmarks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3741,"They are almost 7 years apart in age, but one must also consider the 77W TDP of the i7 desktop to the 15W TDP of the Ryzen 2500U."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3741,"When running on battery, Ryzen is much slower."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3741,I need to dig my screen-shots to compare A/C power & battery only performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3741,"Overall, it's pretty good for the price, but road warrior it definitely is not, as it runs out of battery power within 4.5-5 hours."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3742,I've been using the E485 for few months now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3742,"While its slower when booting up as compared to my full fledged desktop, it is not unexpected since we are looking at a 15W vs 95W CPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3742,"Once it is fully boot up, I never really felt that it is slow."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3743,"Usually laptop that are ship, the preload OS comes with bloatware."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3743,If you know how to fresh install than do a clean install.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3743,Speed will vastly improve over factory image that is loaded onto the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3744,"If I choose SSD M2 NVME option, could I add on another 2TB hardisk later?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3744,I need big storage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3744,Does it come with normal hardisk cage if I choose SSD option?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3745,"Actually, the laptop have relatively few bloatware pre-installed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3745,"The main ones I have seen so far:
1"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3745,MS Office 2016 trial from MS Store.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3745,2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3745,Mcafee Total Protection
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3745,30 days trial.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3745,3
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3745,Lenovo Vantage & other Lenovo tools which are useful
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3745,All of these can be uninstalled.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3746,E485 & E585 comes with the cage & SATA cable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3747,I agree.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3747,"Across most of the laptop brands I have used, I get the least bloatware on the ThinkPad E485."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3747,The other one that came with no bloatware at all was from Aftershock.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3748,will it recognize the free 1 year subscription for office 365?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3749,"If you have subscribed to Office 365, you should be able to log in and download Office to your desktop/ laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3750,I am considering to get this laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3750,Should I wait for PC show which held next month?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3750,Hoping for more discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3751,Is this laptop available from the shop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3751,"The delivery date from Lenovo is 2 week, kinda long."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3752,"If you are not in a rush, no harm waiting."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3752,"But based on my observation, PC Show or not is unlikely to impact pricing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3752,"If you are thinking of looking for it at the show, I believe it cost more."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3753,"If you are in a rush, then may not be suitable for you."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3753,"While I received it in less than 2 weeks, delivery time line can be impacted by many factors."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3754,Looks like Lenovo is clearing stock for the upcoming E495/E595.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3754,Labour day promo is on now @
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3754,"25% off for both models.
https://www.lenovo.com/sg/en/deals/special-offer/"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3755,Is aftershock laptop good?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3755,I am considering getting the forge 15.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3756,Is it the lowest price so far?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3756,Should I wait till PC show?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3757,Lowest price so far outside of the Education discount 25% vs $300 discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3757,"Maybe by PC Show in June, they will sell the new models liao."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3758,Also depends on desired config.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3758,Lowest ever for 16GB RAM config was probably with night promo code and free RAM upgrade some months back.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3758,But just a matter of a few ten of dollars even if you want to try to catch the bottom?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3758,lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3759,"Yeah, Lenovo UK already listed new ones not for sale yet though."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3760,Pretty good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3760,Bought a mx15 for my son.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3761,How to get the education discount?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3762,The new model E495 is now available to order from Lenovo SG website.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3763,The new E495 wireless card is using Intel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3764,Some observations.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3764,- The 3yr onsite warranty upgrade is no longer 0.01
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3764,but S$145.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3764,"- For the e495 there is mention of black & silver colour, though don't quite see where to select the option"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3765,The E495 WiFi is 2x2 MiMO compared to E485 1x1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3765,so WiFi connectivity should be better on E495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3766,Strange that the Ex95
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3766,psref states no USB3 gen2 port while the Ex85 have them.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3767,"Yeah, I just noticed that."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3767,What makes this laptop so attractive to me is the 3 years onsite warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3767,"In fact over the last couple of months, I also noticed that the base prices have been increasing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3768,"Hi there, I got an Lenovo ideapads145 with A9425 chip, can it be upgraded to Ryzen r5 1600x diy?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3768,Advice needed!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3769,Anyone compare the spec between Ideapad 330s and thinkpad e585?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3769,It seems 330s is using i7 processor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3769,The downside is ideapad 330s<$1k model is using normal hardisk.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3770,No........
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3771,The price for e495 is not that bad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3771,3500u
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3771,16 gb and 256 SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3771,Around 961.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3772,It's not 0.01 but a dollar now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3773,"Yup, great that the steep upgrade pricing lasted only a day or so..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3773,Anyway e595 is listed for sale now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3773,No upgrade options available yet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3773,Likely in the process of updating
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3774,e595 options available now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3775,The APU is soldered to the mainboard so cannot be upgraded.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3775,Best to get a new laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3776,price are creeping up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3776,"Used to be 660, after Ryzen 3Gen"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3776,"come, 740."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3777,Price have indeed been creeping upwards.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3777,"As for the newer models, I guess it is not unexpected for them to charge more since its new."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3777,I also recalled someone mentioned that it comes with a better wifi card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3778,config shows a intel 9260 installed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3778,but still no backlit
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3778,kb
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3779,Apparently the E495/E595 supports DDR4 2666MHz memory.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3779,I just downloaded the Option Compatibility matrix from this page:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3779,So the differences so far at least for Singapore market.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3779,1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3779,Slightly faster CPU
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3779,"Ryzen+ 12nm
2"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3779,Edited
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3779,8
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3779,"May Supports DDR4 2666MHz memory, but Lenovo still sells with DDR4 2400mhz."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3779,3 Improved battery life From 12nm process & possibly better optimised firmware/BIOS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3779,4 Better Wifi card Intel AC9260 2x2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3780,"if you are not in need of a ryzen laptop, advisable to skip till next year iteration where it will be true 7nm."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3780,this is just zen+
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3781,"Memory wise, according to spec sheet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3781,DDR4
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3781,2666MHZ install will run at 2400mhz.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3782,Is E585 or E595 a better purchase and what are the difference in price and specs?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3783,At this point in time.. if you are getting.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3783,get the newer version.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3783,imo la.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3784,"E585 AMD Ryzen 7 2700U Processor 6MB Cache, up to 3.80GHz"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3784,"E595 AMD Ryzen 5 3500U Processor 4MB Cache, up to 3.60GHz"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3784,Which processor is better?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3784,It seems E585 has faster and larger cache CPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3785,"In case anyone getting the newer ones, use ANNIVERSARY15 as the coupon code, u'll get 15% as compared to other codes which is ~10% off only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3786,You can choose ryzen 7 for e595 also.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3787,"Depend on your budget, if you want to save than older model E585."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3787,E595 at this time it is pricey than E585 but the APU is newer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3787,as well as WLAN is using Intel AC than previous Qualcomm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3788,They have exactly the same amount of cache 2MB L2 & 4MB L3.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3788,Lenovo just use different ways of calculating it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3788,2700U or 3700U cpu is not worth it
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3788,IMHO due to the steep price increase over 2500U or 3500U.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3788,"Likewise, the price difference is small between both models, just go for the newer model."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3789,"Regardless of AMD or Intel, there is very little reason to pay more for the higher end"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3789,"Ryzen 7 or Core i7 ultra low voltage processors, i.e 15W TDP."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3789,"Most reviews have shown that if both the CPU and GPU are taxed simultaneously, they generally perform no better than their lower end"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3789,"Ryzen 5 or Core i5 counterparts because 1TDP is capped, and 2Cooling solution is generally customized for the TDP."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3789,"There are rare cases where I've seen the higher end CPU making a difference, and in almost every case, its because they are running a discrete graphic card and better cooling."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3790,"I've not been checking the price, but if the price difference is not that great, then go for the newer version."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3791,This is questionable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3791,12nm is nothing but a tweaked + more matured 14nm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3791,"So while it will certainly become more efficient, I suspect the increase in clockspeed over the older chips will nullify the potential improvement to battery life."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3792,"If we ignore the Boost clockspeeds, base clockspeed increase is minimum, just 100mhz for both 3500U & 3700U."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3792,So I suspect that they focused on maintaining or lowering the power consumption instead.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3792,Also the high idle power consumption may be improved in this iteration via other means such as further platform optimization & hardware bug fixes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3792,"As of now, AMD's 2018 Raven Ridge @14nm is not even on par with Intel 2014 Haswell @22nm in terms of idle power consumption."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3792,AMD has a lot of catching up to do in this aspect of mobile computing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3792,It's something which Intel has a lot more experience in.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3793,"Even though I agree, take note that Intel NB chips"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3793,the onboard graphic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3793,isn't that as fast/powerful as compare with AMD Vega.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3793,If power were to go down than the onboard Vega performance will also be hamper.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3793,These chips are not just CPU
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3793,but they also have IGP with it on the same die.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3794,"For those looking at budget laptop, the upcoming Lenovo T495/T495S/X395/X395S will definitely be out of your league."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3794,Pricing will be above $1k depending on specs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3794,AMD Ryzen APU Thinkpad the advantage would be one chip.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3794,to rule them all.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3794,Unlike Intel based laptop if you need better graphic than.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3794,have to opt for optional Nvidia graphics which cost more.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3794,Downside I think most will agree is that AMD Ryzen APU
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3794,battery time isn't that as good with Intel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3794,Since Ryzen APU packs a powerful CPU and GPU on one die.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3795,Does that mean E595 is a good buy
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3796,Should this be more or less the best price around le?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3797,let's wait for a proper review on E495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3797,Tempted to get one!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3797,Let's see the battery life first
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3798,Am a little tempted to get a x240.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3798,Ya
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3798,I know its freaking old model.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3798,Saw online selling refurbished set at around $250 with the usual shop warranty one month.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3798,But I have no experience handling preown laptops.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3798,I am worried what if the previous owners installed some spyware inside then
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3798,I use kena...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3798,Coincidentally saw audiohouse posted this.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3798,"Same x240, selling $369."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3798,Tempted if they throw in any promo to reduce further...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3798,Sent from Xiaomi POCOPHONE F1 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3799,"Do a SSD or HDD Secure Delete, then install new Windows or Linux OS."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3799,X240 is okay
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3799,", personally I just hate it's clicky Touchpad..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3799,the x40 series touchpads are the worst in Thinkpads.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3799,"If you are comfortable opening the laptop to do maintenance changing thermal paste, adding RAM or storage drive, 2nd hand laptops are fine."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3799,Just don't expect good battery life from an old refurnished laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3800,Is this with the education discount?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3800,"If yes, don't need to consider much, can hoot liao."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3801,"Refurbished sets after secure delete, how to install windows again ah??"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3801,?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3801,"Paiseh ah, sorry for the noobness..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3801,"Because I likely will be streaming videos from YouTube or China websites, internet surfing, sometimes work on words or excel work files nia."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3801,Shouldn't be considered
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3801,heavy-duty bah
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3801,I suppose?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3801,Sent from Xiaomi POCOPHONE F1 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3802,"For me, I use PartedMagic."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3802,"Usually refurnished sets comes with Windows 7 OEM anyway, so it's good to install a newer OS anyway."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3802,"If you plan to use Windows 10, you have to take the OS cost into account as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3802,One advantage of an old ThinkPad...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3802,Linux compatibility is usually excellent.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3803,If the refurbished set is installed with Windows 10 liao.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3803,"When I do a wipeout, the Windows 10 os automically be there or I have to do some installation work?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3803,I reading online
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3803,"says it's quite effortless click, reformat, wait"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3803,", it will reboot back with the same Windows 10 but clean empty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3803,"Because I getting from those SLS shop, the seller claims he can install office 365 foc for me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3803,"But if I secure delete, the foc office 365 will be gone also right?"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3805,Anyone know which shop is selling below Lenovo website retail price?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3806,Is E595 OK for light gaming?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3806,Such as maplestory runescape
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3807,what discount is this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3807,can we apply too?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3808,It should be able to run.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3809,"To reinstall Windows 10, you just need to download the Windows media creation tool and create a boot disk to perform a clean installation."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3809,"If the laptop comes with an activated Windows 10 previously, then you do not have to bother about entering any keys."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3809,"For FOC Office 365, I suspect it is only a 1 month trial."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3810,Think we need a new thread for E495/E595 soon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3811,"I let someone create, someone other than me to do it else"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3811,I maybe suspect as AMD promoter.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3813,so
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3813,you can customized it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3813,Example ram
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3813,maybe it came with 1 X 8 GB ram.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3814,seems like latest may AMD drivers fixed the black screen for video playback in chrome!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3814,edit: seems like not really

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3819,The good thing is that this laptop got one pcie and one sata3 port.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3819,Means can put in two disc drive!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3820,Do let us know your impression of the laptop when you get it.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3820,"2500U, 16GB ram + additional SATA SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3821,The only difference between E495 & E595 is LCD screen size?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3821,Both come with black color option only?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3822,"Yes, black only weridly"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3822,the pic show silver which means maybe later time.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3825,"Thinkpad is business line, it won't be feature in IT show."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3825,Ideapad and Legion consumer line than yes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3826,"I did see some thinkpad on sale, but not sure"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3834,Actually have but most of them are not here in SG.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3834,Lenovo seems the only one brining them here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3834,=- HP a few models but Very pricey
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3834,=- Asus
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3834,their new Ryzen gaming line not sure when arrive
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3834,=- Dell NOT bringing them here
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3834,"Since the refresh model is here,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3834,so existing model most likely
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3834,they will clear off.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3835,Was shopping around for a friend and found
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3835,"After coupons, cart and etc is approximately below $950"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3835,How is this comparable with E495?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3835,"It has backlit keyboard not that it matters, longer battery stamina, lighter by at least 250grams to my friend"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3835,it matters alot and my last e485
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3835,"the weight on lenovo is not accurate it is heavier than what was advertised, thin bezel.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3835,mx150
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3836,Depend on your preference but Thinkpad build and keyboard is better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3836,Since you owned the e485 than if you feel swift is better than that.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3836,just get it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3837,Dis you get additional 15% from 961?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3837,Or 961 is after discount?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3838,This looks very tempting!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3838,"New to thinkpad here, can't seem to find many reviews on this"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3838,e495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3838,though..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3838,Is it a new model?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3839,New model reviews usually won't be out so soon maybe within 6 months.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3840,Does the E485/ E495 support the regular 45W charger?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3840,I was thinking of getting the Xiaomi 45 W changer and the Powerbank with USB PD 45W.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3841,"It works with the Xiaomi 45W Type C charger, but not sure about the powerbank."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3842,Just bought a set.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3842,Any lobang to get a 1tb sata 3 ssd?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3843,You can either check on Lazada for say a 1TB Transcend SSD or check on Amazon Prime Now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3843,"You should be able to get 1TB for around 150 bucks after discount on Lazada, or on Prime Now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3844,I agree keyboard is better on the ThinkPad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3844,"Build wise, it really depends since the E series is really the budget series, while the Swift 3 is not really that budget based on their price."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3844,My sister is using Swift 3
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3844,and I think the build is better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3844,Only downside about the Swift 3 I believe is the fact that you don't get much upgrade option since the memory is soldered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3844,"In this case, the ThinkPad E series is more versatile since we can add more RAM and have a secondary drive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3845,I don't think there is anything significantly different between this and the older E485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3845,Look up for reviews for E485
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3845,and you should get a reasonably close review of the E495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3845,"You should see slight improvements with performance, and better WIFI performance depends if Lenovo uses Intel wireless card."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3846,Thinkpad has many series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3846,Seems L series A series and E series around $1k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3846,Which series more value for money?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3847,"E series, E495/E595 are the best value for now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3847,A series will be under T series very soon so that series pricing may drop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3848,"Not to mention improved battery life, due to the 12nm CPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3849,I feel we may not see much of an improvement in this area.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3849,"12nm is actually a refined 14nm, which is basically the same as Intel's branding of 14nm+."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3849,So the improvement is not going to be significant.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3849,"If AMD maintained the clockspeed, we may see an improvement in efficiency, but since they bumped up both the CPU and GPU speed, it will nullify any improvements to battery life."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3850,Thanks Watzup_ken and Techidiot for the advise.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3850,Will check out the e485 before I make a decision!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3851,That is good to know.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3851,I thinking of getting a compactUSB Type Charger so that I can travel without having too many chargers if I getting this laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3852,I'm considering between E495 and Vivobook S14.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3852,"For those using the E485, are your laptop lasting?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3853,Thinkpad - Business
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3853,Vivobook - Consumer
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3853,"The choice is definetely Thinkpad, since it is meant for business"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3853,so.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3853,durability would be better than consumer grade laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3853,"I have stop supporting Asus, their service center is a let down."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3853,"Don't forget Thinkpad you can opt for onsite warranty,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3853,"anything
can call so need to bring down for servicing like Asus laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3854,Considering E495 and C340 AMD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3854,C340 is paying premium for the ability to convert and touchscreen?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3855,We will need to wait for more reviews to confirm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3855,"But in the full review of a 35W Picasso 12nm laptop with discrete graphics link below, the idle power consumption is much lower than all Raven Ridge 14nm laptops."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3855,"Apparently, there was some issue with higher idle power consumption which is fixed in the Picasso 12nm CPUs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3855,Also AMD only raise the clockspeeds a little 5%- <10%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3856,"AMD Ryzen 5 3500U Processor 4MB Cache, up to 3.60GHz"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3856,"AMD Ryzen 7 3700U Processor 4MB Cache, up to 3.80GHz"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3856,Price difference is $130.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3856,Most of the buyers here choose Ryzen 5 or 7?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3857,Ryen 5 will do fine for normal usage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3857,Unless you intend to game than get the Ryzen 7.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3858,But integrated graphics right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3858,Noob question
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3858,", I don't game but mostly use it fir work where I open multiple chrome tabs 30-40 and YouTube."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3858,Does integrated graphics work good enough or
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3858,can it be changed myself otherwise?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3859,"If you need to open 30 to 40 tabs of chrome, I think RAM must have at least 8GB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3859,My house laptop has dedicated graphic card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3859,My office laptop using integrated graphic card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3859,I cannot detect any difference via watching YouTube.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3860,"You need lots of RAM for this, the Ryzen IGPU is superior than Intel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3860,HD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3860,so graphic power wise
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3860,it is decent enough without need.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3860,for dedicated graphics like MX150/MX250.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3861,打PUBG吃雞，雷神5可以啦！
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3862,Did anyone bought the C340 $899 model?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3862,It is a good deal after 15% discount and 9% shopback.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3862,It also come with 3 years on site warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3862,But the delivery is in Oct'19.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3862,Is it the norm?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3862,"First time, I bought from Lenovo online site."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3863,Thanks for your recommendation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3863,Decided on the E495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3863,Onsite warranty is really useful
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3863,and it's 3 years compare to 2 years for other brands.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3864,如果E595内部與585一樣沒什麽改變的話。。。https://little-beans.net/howto/thinkpad-e580-parts/。。。這樣提升内存應該方便吼？
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3865,"Hi All,
Which laptop to choose based on your hands on experience?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3865,1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3865,E495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3865,2 E595.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3865,3 A485
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3866,E series definitely.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3866,The A series will be refresh soon so best skip.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3866,"Between 4 or 5, take note of the size."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3866,595 is bigger and heavier than 495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3866,If you want portability than 495 will do fine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3867,E series more plastic?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3867,A series is aluminium?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3868,E series E485/495 is mostly metal case for the display frame.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3868,The other half Keyboard/palmrest area is all plastic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3868,No idea about A series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3868,"A485 seems to have weaker cooling than the E series, though this may have been alleviated in newer BIOS versions."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3869,"hey guys,
E495 battery life is around 3h ??????????"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3869,freaking cui...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3869,i really suggest you guys buy something else if you need a long battery life
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3870,You got your E495 already?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3870,I have a E595
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3870,", it's about the same if not worse."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3870,"Besides battery life, it's still a pretty good laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3870,Try switching from the Ryzen optimised power plan to Windows Balanced power plan.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3870,Apparently the Ryzen optimised power plan is obsolete in Windows 10 build 1809.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3871,"The A series which I know is really focused on portability, i.e. small and light."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3871,Therefore the cooling solution is weaker.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3871,"For example, you are likely to see 1 heatpipe vs 2 heatpipes when comparing A and E series laptops."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3872,yes it is that chui.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3872,hence i got myself the acer swift instead.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3873,"While I agree if battery life is a priority then better to look elsewhere, we do have to account for the fact that it is a ThinkPad at sub 1k price tag."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3873,Typically budget series laptop comes with budget battery capacity as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3874,Worth to get T495 over E495?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3875,under 1k i don't really expect the rest of the other brands to last significantly longer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3876,there are - depends on what you want.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3877,"If battery life is important, get the regular Intel based E490 lor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3878,Really depends especially budget as T495 will cost twice depending.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3878,on the configuration.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3878,Advantage over E are: - Option for better panel. - WWAN included.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3878,- Onboard 8GB ram. -
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3878,Better chassis and build than E. - Docking port.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3878,T495 with Ryzen 7 with best configuration will cost near $2k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3878,Like others mention if battery is a concern than get Intel based.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3879,How is your usage?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3879,Gaming?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3879,"According to Lenovo spec, it can last for 13 hours for video playback."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3880,what do you recommend?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,That depends what is more important that u need.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,"If battery life is a concern, go get the Swift 3."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,The Swift 3 with HD Graphics and i5 - cost u less than $900 over at Qoo10.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,"It is 1.45KG, with backlit keyboard, longer battery stamina and nice metallic thin 3 sided bezel, modern looking case"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,+
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,the Fn key is in the inside not the outside
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,If u top up alittle more to get the 1 with MX150/250 @ 1298-1398 before discount - if u play your card rights - it should be below 1k or close to 1k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,Currently Qoo10 has 15% off with AMEX for QCoins.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,Acer - Qoo10 also have $30
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,U can wait for the next 100 off 1000 or 40/50 off 300 etc
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,coupons to bring it further south.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,"However, if onsite warranty is a concern because you buy a laptop and expect it to break multiple times - go for Lenovo with 10 years ago battery life but ""better"" durability and almost 500g heavier in weight."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,"Also, the Vega10 is pretty decent compared to the pathetic Intel HD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,"Maybe to some, 500grams is nothing - note that i have to carry alot of other stuffs and not just the laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,any potential weight savings is a huge welcome.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,Note:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,I am comparing with Ryzen 7 vs i5-8265
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,the 8265 is on par with Ryzen 7 - scores based on
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,"In other words, i feel the Acer Swift 3 is more value for money than Lenovo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3881,Lenovo used to be more attractive however the recent surge in pricing doesn't do justice to it any longer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3882,"Basically:
- Longer battery ="
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3882,"Intel based laptop
- Better Graphics"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3882,= amd Ryzen based laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3882,Intel HD is crappy as compare with Vega graphics.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3882,Probably also Intel HD graphic consume less power than Vega.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3882,Overall battery time on Intel would be better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3883,You comparison link is to a i7?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3883,do you have the link?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3883,cause i can't find the swift 3 with similar specs to the one a guy bought recently
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3883,e495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3884,Ryzen 7 vs i5.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3885,"Probably on airplane mode, single channel memory, 2.5 inch drive bay not utilized, and with the 720pnon-HD display."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3885,And at 50% or lower brightness.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3885,Basically with unrealistic settings
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3885,lah.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3886,"note this model comes with Nvidia MX250, PCIe SSD...
only with Shop, Cart and Gift Card.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3886,without the 15% already from 1398 >
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3886,1069
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3886,And without riding on the AMEX 15%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3887,Whatever Lenovo claimed 13 hours...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3887,its probably theoretical ...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3887,Take it with a handful of salt... if you can get 6 hours ... very good already..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3887,Trust me...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3887,I used Lenovo laptop before.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3887,Whatever operation hours they say.... simply divide by factor of 2.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3888,when i click in to see.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3888,is a i7
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3888,Intel Core i7-8565U
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3889,"Other than the graphics,battery life"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3889,i still think lenovo thinkpad is a better choice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3889,16gb and 512 ssd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3890,"Quite true, most over declared..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3890,Divide by 2 you should be near...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3890,"at this weight and pricing, I am happy with 4 hours or so if battery life.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3890,Enough for half day worth of work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3891,i would rather purchase thinkpad over acer anytime
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3891,LOL......
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3891,anyway i just purchased a xiaomi powerbank
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3891,this will at least increases the battery life
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3892,Lol?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3892,U can always swap this yourself.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3892,If you include all of it the prices is going to be higher than value for money dude
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3892,"Btw, is sgd1071.30 for whatever you've thrown in."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3892,Ryzen 3700u
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3892,16
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3892,GB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3892,512GB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3892,"Laptop, most important parts are GPU and CPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3892,These are the two you cannot change.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3892,Ram and SSd are the least of anyone's concern.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3892,"At least for mine, that is."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3892,"Anyway, as long u feel good, e495 is good however definitely not VFM"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3893,So instead of 1.8kg now need to add weight for the battery as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3893,Anyway i am just sharing my opinion and thoughts.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3893,Might be useful for others.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3893,Not so much for thinkpad die hard fans
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3894,which laptop is VFM?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3895,"I just got the E595 and tested that on first charge, the battery can last over 4hours no issue with screen brightness set to maximum."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3895,"I think pretty sure can last for 6 to 7 hours of usage normally with screen brightness to maximum, Surf net, run cpu, gpu, hard disk crystaldiskmark and geekbench 4 benchmark."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3895,"I did not get Ryzen 3700u as I choose 3500u as one hundred over include 15% off does not give me 10% faster performance, I would say too little performance increase not worth it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3895,Vega 8 integrated graphics benchmark is 11% higher than Vega 10 graphics so is a minus point for Ryzen 3700u CPU build in graphics as I google
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3895,it do not know how true is that.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3895,"I open up the back cover very easy, just unscrew all the back cover, then ply open slowly from the top where the hot air vent is one by one got clip not to use too much force to break the clip"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3895,", it should come out easy the whole piece."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3895,"I remove the 4GB DDR4 2600mhz installed default, put in 2X16GB ram DDR4 2400mhz"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3895,ripsaw CL16 brought online overseas from Newegg free shipping here for S$185.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3895,"My laptop brought online from Lenovo SG website include SSD M2 512GB, FHD screen, 65W power charger upgrade, plus 3 years onsite warranty, Lenovo bag and wireless mouse cost 842.8 Singapore dollars quite worth it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3895,"The laptop is not too heavy, to replace my Sony 15inch laptop purchase in End Sep 2012 which is a bit heavy and bigger."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3896,The m2 is using half size 2242 got extension holder.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3896,Tonight I try on my hard disk M2 2280 size I think can fit in directly without the extension holder maybe?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3896,Also empty box for the normal 2.5inch hdd or SSD Sata drive can put as secondary drive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3897,this can work on the e595?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3898,You're right..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3898,the extra cash for the 3700 is not worth it..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3898,just a slight performance increase.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3898,3500 is better
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3899,"I think if xiaomi can support usb c PD 45W charging as what it mention by the lazada seller in Question and answer, this e595 should work as default charger is 45w unless you pay extra for upgrade."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3900,I got the xm pb from here
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3900,Can charge my ThinkPad laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3901,"I am able to fit in 2280 M2 SSD well, weight is almost 1.9kg,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3901,"a hundred over gram more that what Lenovo stated 1.75kg, with dummy HDD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3902,Thanks for unbiased feedback.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3902,Dont mind
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3902,i ask what is brand for the default memory and sdd included?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3903,just tried with the xiaomi gen 3 powerbank.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3903,yup
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3903,"it works, can charge!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3904,"the default ram brand is ramaxel for 4GB size one piece shipped, never heard of this brand."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3904,SSD brand for my 512gb upgraded shipped is WD brand PC SN520 model.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3905,OEM brand ram which are not sold separately at retail shops.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3906,Comes with sk hynix pcie ssd .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3906,I open up the laptop and added an cruical mx500 500gb cost $94 on carousell.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3906,"Using it for dual boot, ubuntu on the sata3 ssd and windows on the pcie m2 slot"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3906,Total cost if shopback approve is.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3906,$961*0.93 + $94  = $987.73
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3906,Ryzen 3500u
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3906,fhd screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3906,16gb ram.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3906,500gb pcie ssd
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3906,500gb sata 3 ssd
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3906,3 years onsite warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3906,I guess it's acceptable for the price i paid vs the battery life.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3906,"This is thinkpad we are talking, not Ideapad, not acer."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3906,"Even though it's the lower end series, it's still a thinkpad"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3907,I have received Ideapad C340 laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3907,It is a good buy around $700 with 15% discount and 9% rebate from shopback.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3907,"It is a 2 in 1 laptop with touchscreen with active pen, Ryzen 5, 512ssd, 8 gb ram, backlit keyboard and 3 years on site warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3907,Moderate usage battery last for 5 hours with work and light gaming.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3908,How long did you wait for your C340?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3908,I'm seeing delivery more than 4 weeks for the lowest range of C340.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3909,Thanks for your review.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3909,I am still thinking to change to Ryzen 7 after I placed order for Ryzen 5.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3909,The difference is $100++
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3910,I received it within 2 weeks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3911,value for money sia.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3911,yea its a thinkpad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3911,quality is considerably better than other brands.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3912,yup.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3912,don't know why there are people here comparing ideapad series or acer low end mod.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3913,Either students or those haven't heard of Thinkpad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3913,"Ideapad is no no, once I tested that it is very crap laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3913,The LCD panel itself is very poor quality especially for entry models.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3914,What's the difference between E485 and E495 other than the processor?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3914,Is the battery life better on the newer version?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3914,I recalled E485
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3914,was only about $600
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3914,or so
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3914,but it's now 800-900
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3915,Battery life should be more or less the same but dependent on usage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3915,Take note of the WIFI card as E495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3915,is using Intel WLAN which is better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3915,than E485 which is using qualcomm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3915,"If I were you, I just get the newer E495 will do."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3916,anyone tested E495 under load?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3916,how is the temperature and fan noise?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3917,@orlengtao surprised that you are not getting better battery life like the e595 as per Hive
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3917,Can you run the following command for battery life estimate.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3917,there will be a html report generated & then just look for the batt estimate heading.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3917,1 Run CMD as admin.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3917,2 powercfg /batteryreport
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3917,Perhaps @Hive and @batniss
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3917,swift 3 can run the above command & share their results as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3917,"If e485 and e585 owners also share their results, then easier to compare."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3918,"My battery last 4 hours on first charge, full charge."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3918,Haven't go to second charge yet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3919,"Unfortunately we shared different opinions on ""value for money""."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3919,"Hence even if i managed to show you a better result, it will not yield much to the people who already has fixated mindsets."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3919,I am just sharing with an open-heart
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3919,yet all i got was sarcasm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3919,"However, i understand some people are die-heart fans so is ok."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3919,I believe a Thinkpad can easily thrash Nvidia MX250 because of the built of the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3919,Your processing power is based on the word thinkpad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3919,"Put the thinkpad word means ur laptop is faster by 2000% like those people stick ""Type R"" on the back of the car..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3919,nitro boost yo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3920,I also don't know why.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3920,I thought is Thinkpad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3920,No idea when it becomes IdeaPad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3920,Didn't know intel & nvidia are considered low end mods either.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3920,"Now i know, i rest my case."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3921,should I get the e495 or a485?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3921,"e495 seems to have solved the thermal throttling issue, but battery life is weak, generally less well built than A series"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3921,a485's thermal throttling issue seems to be quite serious even though it's supposedly better built?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3921,only Ryzen 3 Pro or
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3921,Ryzen 7 Pro is available for selection.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3921,"Which is better, given the thermal throttling issue?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3921,battery life should be much better with the additional 72wh battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3921,Going to get another 8gb stick for either choice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3921,Would love to especially hear from users of the A485 Thinkpad!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3922,sure will do it tomorrow.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3922,"I set high performance and max brightness, maybe that's y lower."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3922,"TBH, if battery life is a prob, don't get this."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3922,Edited: my battery life report.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3922,save that as .html
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3923,Incase you need more reasons to get the e495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3923,3500U is definately the better option imo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3923,better sustain load then 7.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3924,"Workload is O365 Outlook, Word, Excel, Acrobat, Web browser Chrome, firefox"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3925,"E495, take note thermal throttling on A485 is serious as it is only single heat pipe compare with E serious."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3925,Unless you have deep pocket than go for the new T495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3925,but I feel E495 will do fine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3926,Not to mention the Spectre and Meltdown security issues plague Intel processors which impact the performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3926,However like in the article mention AMD laptop battery isn't that great
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3926,so have to wait for E495 review than how long exactly is the battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3927,Current estimate of battery life based on all observed drains since OS install
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3927,: 3:34:37 h
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3927,"This is on a E585 with the following specs 2500U, 2x8GB RAM, M2 PCI-E Samsung PM981 256GB and Samsung 250GB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3927,Been using this notebook for 7 weeks now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3927,"Primary usage is having 3 different browsers Firefox, PaleFox, Brave running at any time, occasionally running Virtualbox."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3927,LCD brightness 80%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3928,Been camping here a while.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3928,Hope to see the battery life for E595
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3929,E595 just over 4 hours of battery life.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3929,Maybe if office work light usage typing surf net could go almost 6 hours with screen brightness at medium.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3930,What is the difference between E495 and E595 other than the screen size and keyboard?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3930,Battery capacity is the same right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3931,Yup.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3931,The E585 & E595 does not make use of the additional space for a higher capacity battery
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3932,"So apparently, Linux compatibility has been improved in the Ex95 series."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3932,Though you will need kernel parameter to work with the NVME SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3933,Just placed an order for E495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3934,How do I clone the original factory image?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3934,Because I ordered the Windows 10 home edition.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3934,Planning to clean install Windows 10 Pro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3934,Sent from Samsung SM
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3934,=-N960F using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3935,Lenovo have download tool to restore the laptop back to factory.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3935,However I would advice not to use that as factory image are rubbish.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3935,"Even if you want to sell, can just install Windows 10 home on it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3935,and done.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3936,how's the T495 like?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3936,hardly any reviews yet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3936,Can get it at about $1250 now
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3936,..is it worth it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3937,Play the spin wheel for 15% off discount code.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3937,About 1025 after that for base option.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3938,"using ""COUPO"" allows for 18% off.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3938,just wondering whether the a485 or the t496 is the lesser of the evils - thermal throttling & being heavier vs more expensive & having the exhaust beside your mouse
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3939,How to do a clean install?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3939,Seems like the default windows 10 home digital license is tied to the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3939,I dl the media creation and install with a USB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3939,but it always default to the Home edition.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3939,I have a oem Windows 10 Pro key.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3939,Sent from Samsung SM-N960F using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3940,Agree with the E495 being the better deal in this case.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3940,"And yes, the A series is really about portability and light weight, so the cut back on the heatpipe is certainly a problem."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3940,"In fact, when I was reapplying thermal paste for my E485, I realized the 2 heatpipes heat up significantly even with the slightest load."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3940,"So if 2 is just enough to keep the temps in check, 1 heatpipe will likely not cut it unless it is one fat heatpipe."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3941,Download Windows 10 ISO to USB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3941,"Just install as usual, it will install Home edition first."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3941,Than later open the MS store to activate the pro key.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3941,Windows 10 will upgrade itself to Home than to pro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3942,Tried but still say my laptop is tied to the windows 10 home digital license?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3942,Anymore with the same problem?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3942,Maybe I shd use a earlier version of Windows creation tool
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3942,Sent from Sony SGP771 using GAGT

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3944,"Doubt it's Windows build error, where did you buy the key from?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3944,"If from Caurosell or places that sell $10 keys, those probably are MS volume."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3944,license key.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3944,You need the Windows installer from the MDSN/Dreamspark website.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3944,in order for the key to work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3944,As such key are either enterprise.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3944,or education license.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3944,It's still a pro version but with a different type of license.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3944,"Take note unless you are intending to use the laptop for office, like domain joining than you need pro version."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3944,Else home version will do fine for home use.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3945,after seeing another folk posting abt this quite gian liao

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3951,"Overall it works well for me, no issues with the hinge, but admit that touch pad is poor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3951,"Changing because it is rather low spec i3, 4gb ram and getting slow for my needs mainly chrome with 15-20 tabs, word processing, netflix, no games."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3952,The normal HDD is optional.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3952,You can always add a 2.5 inch SSD or HDD later since the drive cabby is included by default.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3952,"It's mostly for folks who need:
1"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3952,Extra storage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3952,2 Dual Boot
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3952,"Thinkpad E series despite being budget Thinkpads, will still have better build quality than most Ideapads."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3952,"Since it's not mentioned specifically, the WIFI card on the S540 is most likely from Realtek or Qualcomm."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3952,So the E495 have a small advantage here due to
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3952,it's Intel Wifi card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3952,"Lastly, Business line laptops tend to be better supported than consumer lines."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3952,Meaning more frequent & regular BIOS/driver updates.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3953,The wifi card that was shown when I configured my ideapad L340 gaming was the same as the S540
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3953,and I expected something not from Intel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3953,Ended up to be the Intel AC 9560 when I received it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3954,I would advice not to consider Ideapad the build quality is not as good as Thinkpad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3954,"Most will opt for SSD + HDD, SSD for OS."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3954,"HDD for data, data backup and games."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3954,"Especially if SSD fails, at least HDD act as backup."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3955,"If current HDD used less than 400GB, then drop the HDD and get SSD512G."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3955,"If over 400, get the HDD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3955,"Netflix, HWZ, no games: Ryzen 3 + SSD + 8GB RAM is enough."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3955,More core = more expensive= more electric = more heat = more fan noise all for nothing when they are not used.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3955,Your cheapest upgrade could be buy a SSD to replace the HDD + 4GBRAM for current system.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3956,shall wait for promo first
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3957,I switched from e485 to IdeaPad 720s and disagree that the build quality on the E series Thinkpads are better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3957,I think IdeaPad higher end series quality wise is better than entry level Thinkpad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3957,"For one, the screen assembly on the e485 is too thin such that just touching the back of the screen will cause the LCD to warp."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3957,But between e495 and
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3957,s540
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3957,"I will choose e495, if only for the ability to charge the laptop through USB-C which can come in pretty handy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3958,"If the OS in SSD, once fails, it fails?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3958,The best way is to setup RAID1 for SSD+HDD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3959,I've used a high end
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3959,Lenovo laptop previously
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3959,and yes it is definitely better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3959,However we need to factor in their price range.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3959,"Lenovo 7xx series is considered high to mid high end, while the ThinkPad E series is really the budget end."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3959,So it is not a good comparison.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3959,It will be more appropriate to compare a Lenovo 3xx series with the ThinkPad E series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3959,"And in this case, I believe the ThinkPad build will be better since it is after all targeting corporate clients."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3960,"Honestly if OS is on the SSD, I don't see the point of doing a RAID 1 on it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3960,It fails it fails.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3960,You can always reinstall the OS back on a replaced/new SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3960,"If you are worried about reinstalling all the apps on the SSD, just do a backup image of the drive and store it somewhere."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3960,"If required, you just need to clone the image to the new drive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3960,I don't see the need to complicate solution using things like RAID where it is will just exhaust the already limited storage space in a laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3961,"No need, what I meant as SSD have write cycle limit."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3961,If it fails and you have to wait for RMA.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3961,At least you can install OS onto the HDD as well as store
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3961,all important data on the HDD than SDD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3962,"After viewing for days between E495, E595, X395 & T495."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3962,Decide to take up E595 that fits my tight budget.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3962,Delivery date estimated at 4 - 5 July
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3963,"In the 1st place, RAID 1 can only be done between storage media of the same."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3963,size & type.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3963,You can't do a RAID 1 between SSD & HDD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3964,"if SSD exceeds the TBW and fails, i don't think it is eligible for RMA."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3964,Even SSD vendor exclude TBW exceeds from RMA.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3965,"Thanks for sharing, just citing why there are options for SSD and HDD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3965,For me my data usually are on HDD but not SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3966,Thanks for all the advice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3966,"Haven't been following the CPU news for years, glad to hear all the positive things about AMD these days and would like to support them in my next laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3967,Thanks for this thread.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3967,Just got my E595 today.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3967,My RAM option is 8GB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3967,but usable is 5.88GB only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3967,These 2.12GB is used by graphic card?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3968,How long it take from the time you order and reach SG?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3968,Mine seems to be estimated 3 weeks++
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3969,It took less than 2 weeks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3970,How are you checking to see that you have 5.88GB left?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3970,"The integrated graphics will typically only take up 256mb, and should dynamically allocate more ram to it when you are gaming."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3971,Agree with this approach.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3971,"However given the fact that nowadays the SSD storage size is reasonably big, if one don't game much, there should be ample of space left."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3971,"So nowadays, I don't really care that much whether to save on SSD or mechanical drive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3972,I check both Control Panel -> System & Task Manager-
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3972,>
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3972,Performance
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3972,Both show 5.88GB Usable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3973,add only $1 million for a 65W ac adapter!!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3973,And $855k for a USB dock
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3974,Not the 1st time I have seen pricing mistakes on their Estore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3974,Saw a >$65k  gaming laptop in April.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3975,Most folks will not be able to check out since credit card limit is insufficient.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3976,My order still not shipping...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3977,Expected to ship shows 22nd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3978,"Yes mine too,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3978,reserve 2.1gb ram that is weird.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3978,I try to disable microphone via Bios IO access
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3978,and i have BSOD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3978,Can someone help to confirm their unit have the same problem
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3978,please
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3979,So your order shipped？
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3980,Nope.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3980,No movement
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3981,Well 3 hours more to 23th June and nothing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3982,"if u c any wrong pricing that makes the laptop damn cheap and free, do sic."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3982,thanks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3983,Lol are u hoping to make a profit like the singtel pricing error for nokia 6610 in 2002?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3983,No more.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3983,Lenovo terms and condition will not allow for it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3984,"Ok, my laptop got shipped but my credit card was not charged."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3984,I made payment using paypal.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3984,Should i be concerned?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3984,When the accessories was shipped the card was immediately charged.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3985,Nothing to worry.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3985,They are using ERP system where shipping and billing are two separate function.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3985,Their billing run is most probably batched and run periodically.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3985,Your PayPal will be deducted during their billing run.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3986,"Glad to hear that, waiting mine ship tomorrow"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3987,"Now that t495 is out, will y'all choose t495 or e495?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3987,Both are AMD ryzen processor
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3987,"but t series is more expensive, why is that so?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3988,"=- T series have better build, chassis between T and E are different."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3988,=
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3988,- Longer part availabity for T series since the CPU/APU is.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3988,under pro series while E series CPU/APU is consumer grade.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3988,"- better configuration like better screen, WWAN cardSIM card can use, docking station and many others."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3988,"Basically T series is intended for business, for home/student."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3988,E series will do fine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3988,"E best config is about $1k, T series best config will cost about $1.5k - $2k."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3988,"For gaming wise, would be E since it uses the consumer grade CPU/APU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3988,and the heatpipe inside is dual not single which is found in early A/T series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3988,"Pretty much E series will be ideal regardless of usage, unless you want premium laptop and better parts like screen than go for T."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3989,The E495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3989,no backlit kb
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3989,right??
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3989,"That's the deal breaker for me, else will be ideal..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3989,hmmm....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3989,if goes forT495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3989,...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3989,the config I get
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3989,will be ard $1700+ vs the E495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3989,1200
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3989,+
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3989,.... pain...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3989,Funny
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3989,the description mention got option for backlit kb... but not offer on the model they selling.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3990,"Yes, backlight only on T series."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3991,Thanks...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3991,"not sure wanna up another $500 as the config in E495 is good enough for me, though the T495 screen is delicious...
...."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3992,"T495 one ram slot is soldered, vs E495 of which 2 slot is available, which was the dealbreaker for me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3992,Also cooling is not as good as E495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3993,OIC...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3993,but why oh why they cannot offer a simple backlit kb in E495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3993,.... sigh...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3994,e495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3994,cooling is better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3995,but the price also different ma
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3995,For under 1k..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3995,thinkpad is still good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3996,I just got my E595 and found out that my E595 has a dead pixel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3996,What should I do?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3996,call for exchange or call for onsite warranty?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3997,You should look up their dead pixel policy first.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3997,I get a sense 1 dead pixel is going to be ignored.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3998,When was your credit card charged?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3998,For dead pixel policy is min
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3998,3 dead pixel to qualify for replacement or on site support.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3999,their dead pixel policy is 3.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3999,It just less than 1 week.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,3999,So sien.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4000,Not sure when it was charged.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4000,I just receive last Monday.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4001,When did you receive the invoice for the laptop after the shipping notification email?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4001,1 day after?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4002,ya.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4002,1 day after shipping notification email.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4003,"Btw, if just surf web, watch YouTube, do we really need those 400nits display??"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4004,Nope.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4004,a 250 nits display will suffice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4005,"Thanks, will save me $$$..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4005,"Any case, if I wanna go with Thinkpad I need to get the T495"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4005,/
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4005,"T495s instead of the E495 cause of the backlit keyboard... basket, with the specs I want, could have pay ard $1200++ instead of $1600++ to $1700++"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4005,So T495s >
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4005,T495 cause its lighter??
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4006,glad to help.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4006,with my 250 nits display i never go pass 50-60% brightness level else
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4006,it will be too bright esp since i use my laptops for long periods
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4006,", my eyes cannot take it lol"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4007,Yes T495s is lighter but much higher price than T495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4007,"Take note if you intend to buy T495, if you want to save $."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4007,Make sure WWAN/Mobile broadband adapter is removed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4007,As by default it is included with T495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4008,"Noted, thanks bro."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4008,Still  considering....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4008,if they just include backlit option for E series...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4009,"Bro not sure I miss out anything, but I don't see any WWAN Adapter added in the first place when I configure??"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4010,The brightness is desirable only when you are planning to use it outdoors frequently.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4011,The t495s batt slightly bigger 57w vs 50w
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4011,on 495 got option to add wwan.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4011,Sent from Sony Z4 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4012,Get delayed 😐
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4013,What model you ordered?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4014,"E595, dragged to 26 June"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4015,Anyone facing white spot issue on the LCD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4016,Nope.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4016,I would send for warranty claim.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4016,This is different from dead pixel policy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4017,"Anyway, just received my E495."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4017,Impressed by the built quality.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4017,No flex on LCD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4017,Hinge is solid too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4017,Built in RAM is samsung.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4017,Added 8gb stick of Cruical ram Micron
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4017,and it works.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4018,Good to gear that
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4018,Mine just out from HeFei
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4019,I am looking for a Lenovo Thinkpad
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4019,"I mainly surf internet, microsoft office and some simple gaming maplestory and fifa online 3"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4019,Any recommendations ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4019,Thanks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4020,Buy thinkpad for photoshop ha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4021,You got any good recommendations other than that
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4022,I tok you expert in ps
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4023,I am impressed by T495s
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4023,but the E585 is still working fine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4024,Thinkpad T495s
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4025,Thanks a lot
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4026,You want to sprout nonsense everywhere in the forum ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4027,I think will be good to know if you have any specific requirements and your budget.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4027,Even the humble E495 can handle all the things you mentioned easily.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4028,Hi.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4028,Weight <2kg
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4028,"Low budget, around ~$1,300"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4028,price lower the better
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4028,"No need numpad, but the arrow keys must be big."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4028,Memory 8GB should be sufficient I guess ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4029,u can consider this after the ecoupon discount:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4030,"If you are targeting a budget laptop, then I feel that E495 will be a good fit."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4030,"The downside is the poor battery life, which I think can last anything from 3 to 4 hours if you are just surfing net and doing light work on it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4030,"If you are not too concerned about battery, E series will be good because it is well built, and there is sufficient cooling for the CPU/GPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4030,"And yes, it should be around 1.7KG."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4031,Thanks guys
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4031,Battery life not an issue as I am always on the charger
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4032,"Comparing this Thinkpad E495 with my Company issued Dell Latitude 5480 laptop, E495 wins in built quality."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4033,One more thing -
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4033,I prefer external battery over built-in...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4033,I have the impression that built-in battery doesn't last
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4033,long.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4033,True
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4034,Thinkpad has the utilities that stop charging your battery once it reach a certain percentage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4034,Built in battery have the same lifetime as external battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4034,Plus this is thinkpad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4034,Spare parts will be easy to get.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4035,Anyone encounter this prob?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4035,E495 cannot connect to 5g wifi?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4036,"hi experts, when do lenovo usually have sale?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4036,need to get one before 2nd week of Oct for my classes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4037,Been visiting thier site almost everyday before the purchase
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4037,There will be always promotion on different reason like GSS/Raya/IT Fair etc
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4037,It will be good
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4037,you just list down your budget and requirement so other

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4038,What do you guys think of these 2 ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4038,Any configurations to improve/change or some other models to recommend ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4038,"My requirements:

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4038,Thanks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4039,"Only few points:
-"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4039,For OS best opt for SSD + HDD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4039,OS on SSD while data on HDD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4039,"Windows 10 will crawl on 2.5"" HDD especially those with 5400rpm."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4039,=- RAM wise
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4039,Either opt for 2 X 4GB to tap on dual channel or get 1 X 8GB than add another one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4039,AMD Ryzen will benefit from dual channel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4039,For me I will choose the E series than the T series especially if you intend to game.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4040,"When I got my E485, this is one of my consideration."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4040,"While the internal battery is small, I've managed to get a Aukey 26800mah portable battery that is able to charge the laptop via the Type C port."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4040,The Type C charging point is also better as I don't get tied to some proprietary charging port.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4041,Budget less than 1.1k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4041,Laptop for medium sized data analytics with python.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4041,Gaming; only play hearthstone
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4041,"Good ram best is those can upgrade, Able to dock on docks to link up 2 external monitors."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4041,Light.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4043,Thanks a lot for the info
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4044,Hihi
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4044,Processor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4044,- AMD Ryzen 5 should be sufficient right ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4044,Need to change to Ryzen 7 ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4044,=- SSD + HDD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4044,How about I choose a dummy HDD and select a 500GB SSD ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4044,Thanks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4045,- Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 not much difference
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4045,so 5 will be enough
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4045,=- really up to your preference
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4045,but I will opt for SSD OS and HDD Data
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4045,Else you can opt for bigger SSD and a dummy HDD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4045,However bigger the SSD it will cost more.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4046,The RAID/AHCI driver what is currently being installed?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4046,MS one or AMD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4046,Maybe you want to try AMD Chipset driver from AMD website.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4046,Extract the RAID/AHCI driver and install see whether does it improve or not.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4046,For what I know Lenovo doesn't provide Chipset driver for AMD based laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4047,mine is E595 with 512GB NVME.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4047,The brand is WD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4048,Thanks for the update.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4048,Can help do a speed test for comparison please.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4049,"Made some changes, looks good ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4050,Quite similiar with my E595 configuration
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4050,Just recieved my lappy and feel snappy so far
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4051,Remember to add 1 buck to upgrade the 1 year carry in warranty to 3 years onsite warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4052,How to add the 1 buck upgrade to 3 years onsite??
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4053,Some faster some slower...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4054,I think the 3 years warranty cost changed from $1 to $72.50 now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4055,Thank you appreciate your help
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4056,I don't know if it is a psychological thing that you find it slower.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4056,"While the numbers on the benchmark look like a performance drop, that don't really mean much in real life scenarios, especially when it comes to boot up speed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4056,"Check any reviews out there and you will noticed that even from a SATA3 SSD to a full speed NVME drive, there may only be a few seconds difference when it comes to boot up and file loading speed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4056,Boot up speed is likely a second difference.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4057,yeah true.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4057,i also thought my laptop slowed down after using it for a few days..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4057,UNTIL i went back to my old laptop with slow HDD and then back to the new one
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4057,and suddenly it felt as fast as new again
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4058,The E485/E495 is an underrated gem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4058,"With proper tweaking, it's a very capable machine."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4059,I agree.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4059,"Only downside is the poor battery life, due to small battery."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4059,But one can overcome this problem with a good PD power bank that can output at least 45W.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4060,which ssd u bought?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4061,Anyone knows why Lenovo SG site don't offer 4K screen on their X nor T series?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4062,E495/E595 comes with samsung SSD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4063,"Not worth seriously, not only pricing but battery will drain."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4064,Bought outside.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4064,I bought samsung 1tb ssd at amazon for only 150 sgd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4065,Roughly how Long can the battery last ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4066,My usage is surf net + YouTube.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4066,Roughly around 5 hours.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4067,Anyone try to use its 45W charger to charge Surface Go?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4068,Which model?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4068,Can share more details?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4068,Really good buy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4068,Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4069,"hi guys,
Not sure this is a valid question - If I opt for additional SSD , Lenovo will install the OS on SSD right?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4069,The last thing I want is for them to install windows on the HDD duh when I added on SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4070,Actually I see no point in having a 4K screen on a laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4070,"First the screen is too small, so you will need to scale the fonts to about 250%, and in some cases that it does not scale, you will struggle to see."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4070,"Secondly, it drains battery fast which is not good if you bring your laptop around."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4070,"Thirdly if you game, there is no mobile graphic that can offer you a smooth game play at native resolution if you are into modern graphic intensive games."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4070,"My recommendation if you do want a 4K screen, just get a 4K monitor to supplement it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4070,I got a mobile 15.6 inch 4K monitor for about 250 bucks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4070,"It has the same problem I mentioned in my first point, but its optional and"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4070,"I usually only plug it in when I need 2 screens for work, or for watching movies."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4071,4 to 5 hours max.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4071,"If you want to extend the battery, you can always buy a 20000 MAh or higher PD power bank with a minimal of 45W output to give it more power."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4071,The power bank is optional only when you need it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4071,"In case the power bank dies after some time, you can just get another one to replace."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4072,Should be on the SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4073,"It's the PM981, the E485 I've ordered comes configured with it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4074,Wah... Much faster than my E595 WD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4075,Thanks ...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4076,"For students, will a Ideapad 520S better suit"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4076,their needs or u guys still think Thinkpad E495 is the way to go??
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4076,The ideapad lighter though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4077,Curious about this too
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4078,"I think so, my company issued X series with dual drives has the OS on the SSD."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4081,It's the usual Lenovo hardware lottery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4081,Dell does the same too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4081,They usually have a minimum of 2 suppliers for most hardware components.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4082,"Yes I did, thanks to reminders in this thread"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4083,"Hi there, wanted to check if anyone tried running a 4K video on this GPU?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4083,I noticed its lagging somewhat.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4083,"Its not a E485/585 issue, but I read it somewhere that mentioned that the driver is the culprit."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4084,My e595 lags and sometimes goes black screen for a second before playing 1080p video on YouTube..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4084,not sure why since my config is Ryzen 7 3700u..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4084,not sure if its because Im using single channel 16gb ram only.. will adding another 16gb stick help in this case?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4085,On which web browser?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4085,Also update to the latest AMD graphic drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4086,using chrome?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4086,its chrome problem..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4087,"Disable HW acceleration, some had done this and it works."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4088,My config is Ryzen 5 and 16GB Ram.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4088,Also facing the same issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4088,Using chrome browser.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4089,"For Youtube, I agree it is a problem with Chrome."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4089,"After all, I have disabled HW acceleration for good on it due to multiple issues with it not just on this laptop, but on my past few desktops as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4089,I just tried on Edge and it works fine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4089,However I do noticed some initial video lag when I start watching a movie on iTunes too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4089,"No issues on my desktop, but on the laptop, it seems to lag whenever I start the show."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4089,Its not a network issue as I download the shows I purchased.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4089,I think need to try and update the driver to see if the issue will go away to if it is an iTunes issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4090,"Hi, any one can recommend compatible RAM to replace?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4090,looking to replace with 16GB x02 piece
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4090,and anyone can advise if this E595 will run smoothly with PhotoShop usage?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4093,Thinkpad E595 review is out:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4094,Thanks!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4094,sounds like i shouldn't worried.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4095,It depends on your usage and expectation actually.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4095,"2 things I feel will be a problem if you are a hardcore photoshop user,
1"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4095,Screen is not that great - You will need a better external monitor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4095,2 CPU is that very powerful due to 15W TDP -
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4095,So you can't expect it to process as fast as say a 35/45/65W CPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4096,16 GB should be able to run Photoshop well enough.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4096,"You should use the money to buy a bigger SSD, CPU and best screen as Photoshop is more disk and CPU intensive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4097,"E595 is using low wattage CPU at 15W, so even if it can run."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4097,It won't run that as fast like desktop or laptop with H series CPU/APU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4097,Since it is intended for portability and long battery than high performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4097,"Unfortunately AMD Ryzen H laptop are not available locally,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4097,example
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4097,Asus FX505DT AMD Ryzen 5 3550H
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4097,", Nvidia Geforce 1650."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4097,would be a better option.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4097,Alternate would be Intel H series since most of them are sold locally.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4097,"This also applies to Intel so depend on your budget,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4097,H series laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4097,are much expensive since they usually means gaming laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4097,Example Dell G5 at $1.5k would handle Photoshop much faster than E595.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4097,since it is using Intel H series processor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4097,Downside of laptop using H like Dell G5 is the weight.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4098,"Hi all,
I got my E495 for 2 weeks and really enjoyed as it is better than my work Laptop which is an E440."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4098,Able to play casual games at low setting is great for me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4098,"I do face a small issue, I had shut down the computer but often it restarted randomly instead of shutting down."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4098,"What I mean is after I shut down, the screen turns black"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4098,and then it sort of restarted the computer and goes to the start screen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4098,Any assistance would be appreciated
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4099,"Few things:
- Have you perform full Windows update?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4099,- You can try this:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4099,"-

- Try use CMD,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4099,"At run type ""Shutdown -s -t 00"""
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4099,"All else fails, may have to do a clean format."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4099,Maybe either driver or OS issues.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4100,I still facing the same issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4100,Will try to upgrade to 1903 and see how.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4101,This is quite odd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4101,I face an odd issue as well where the laptop will randomly boot into repair mode at startup.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4102,I had a similar configuration on my S340.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4102,Only difference is I had
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4102,a 512gb SSD and no HDD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4102,Is there a difference between L340 and S340?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4102,Paid 590 for this after shopback
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4103,"An Update, this only happens when the laptop is plugged in."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4103,MY setup is the laptop with HDMI out to the monitor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4103,Once I plugged out the power cord and shut down the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4103,It will shut down without restarting.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4103,"I tried to reset the power option, Lenovo Vantage and also what techidiot suggest."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4103,No luck for now but will see after it will happen again after a feature update.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4104,There should be an option in the BIOS called Power On with AC Attach BIOS >
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4104,Config >
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4104,"Power, trying setting that to Disabled if not already and see if that that helps"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4105,"Hi all, hearing all the good things about AMD E series really gave me the confidence to get E495 with the configuration below with the aim of upgrading the ram and M.2 SSD later on."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4105,Only taking 512 NIVME as I'm not so experienced in self-installation of NVIME.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4105,"Most importantly, can anyone share their experience of DIY upgrading and advise the recommended brand and model of rams/ssd besides Crucial, who listed themselves as Lenovo compatible."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4105,Or is there any shop recommended to bring down and ask them to help me install the parts I want?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4105,Thanks for any input!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4106,Take note warranty you can change to 3 years.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4107,But its not on $1 or $0.01 offer anymore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4107,Now 3 years on-site warranty $72.50.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4107,It's still worth it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4107,Not sure of RMA and warranty process as this is my first Lenovo Thinkpad
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4108,Oh... than it's up to you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4108,Cheers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4109,"72.50 to be honest is not expensive, though I am unsure if the warranty is onsite or carry in."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4109,"If it is onsite, then you can consider from a peace of mind perspective where you don't have to bring the laptop down for servicing since someone is supposed to come to you for repairs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4110,On site warranty means they will service your ThinkPad at your office or home.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4110,Save the hassle to send and collect from service centre.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4110,"Most importantly, your private data will be safe."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4111,"Yeah, i also just bought via Lenovo and got the $72.50 3 years on-site warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4111,Just order the Lenovo X395 using the Ryzen 5 3500U. Hopefully will be ok
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4112,"Was deciding between E494 and Ideapad S540, but bought the Ideapad S540 instead due to the nicer design."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4112,Paid for extended warranty for a total of 2 years.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4113,ThinkPad is for easy open and good typing experience.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4113,Ideapad is more lifestyle and focus more on slick design.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4114,X395 or e495 better?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4114,Why is x395 more exp even tho
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4114,the processor is just ryzen 3
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4115,14 inch via 13.3 inch
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4115,What do you decide this between both?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4115,Weight : 1.25kg vs 1.75kg
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4115,X395 Ryzen Pro vs E495 non Pro CPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4115,X395 ram onboard while E495 ram can upgrade.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4115,E495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4115,no fingerprint and backlight keyboard.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4115,The rest all same
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4116,"As what obichacha have quoted, X and E series are different."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4116,"The APU/CPU is also different, X395 uses Ryzen 3 pro."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4116,X series is intended for ultralight weight and portability
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4116,so it is much lighter than E.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4116,Take
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4116,note X395 ram isn't upgradable and it only have SSD option.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4116,as compare with e495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4116,where you can opt for SSD and HDD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4116,Basic use
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4116,e495 will do fine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4117,"Thanks, I will try on that."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4117,"So far as long the laptop not fully charged at 100%, it will not on."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4117,I played with the Lenovo Vantage to stop charging at 95%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4117,So far no issue
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4118,Power cord at 65W
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4118,mean it charge faster then 45W?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4119,X2 faster than the 45W
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4120,Lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4120,😂
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4120,hopefully will ship out in time
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4121,"Just received my E595, can't help but notice an electrical buzzing sound."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4121,It's not loud
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4121,but it's audible in a quiet room.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4121,You guys think this is normal?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4122,"oh no, i feel like getting E595 also, sounds like HDD issue or fan issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4122,"otherwise, how is the performance so far?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4123,No complaints about performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4123,Will monitor the buzzing sound
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4124,I own an E595 and help my fren buy a budget HP Ryzen 3 laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4124,So far veey satisfy with the performance for the money paid.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4125,Actually the performance of Ryzen already proven..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4125,i tested multiple setup with Ryzen 3 & i think compare to Intel entry setup this really flies...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4125,only concern is on the reliability.. need to see how it is proven.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4125,AMD used to gave us reliability issue around 2-3 years... with processing speed improving & SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4125,these lappy nowadays can last 3- 5 years... & still very good
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4126,"Nowadays the recent laptops can’t even last more than 4 years, cause due to software upgrade much faster than our hardware."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4126,Unless you keep this for general use purposes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4126,"For AMD technology can last you more than 3 years, this is consider Super worthy for money."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4127,Lenovo kept postponing ... twice .. saying parts issue ... cancelled my order ...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4127,hope you have better luck.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4128,How you cancel your order?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4128,"My E490 also got delayed, tried using their live chat"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4128,but it doesn't even load the thing when I press it
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4128,", do I have to call them?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4128,Wonder if I can still cancel since I already received my bag and mouse first.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4129,G5 where got so cheap
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4129,Maybe G3 la
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4129,Hahaha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4129,coz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4129,I wan buy also
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4130,Mainlycoz of this window 10?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4130,Then shitty to me
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4131,What games r u playing???
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4132,Then go live chat and ask for more discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4132,Usual
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4132,they do for all customers
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4133,I got my refund thru livechat at the lenovo website.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4133,the customer rep emailed their logistics side to expedite but even he didnt get a reply from this own logistics!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4133,he helped me close the account.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4133,i saved myself the nightmare of delays and further delays and went to SLS and bought a Dell on the spot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4134,Buzzing sound may be a coil whine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4134,At least I don't notice it on the older E485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4135,I don't know how you can quantify AMD reliability at around 2 to 3 years.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4135,"Do note that say if you buy a laptop, while the laptop is powered by an AMD chip, the parts selected in a laptop is the responsibility of the manufacturers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4135,"So if you want cheap, then do expect some corners to be cut, i.e. poorer quality components used."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4135,"Moreover, there is no guarantee that even top end components will not fail."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4135,"I've used multiple laptops, and I am sure Intel powered laptops have a clean sheet in terms of failure rate."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4135,But I don't ding them as it is the laptop manufacturers' problem most of the time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4136,Yeah bought the same accessories as you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4136,Waiting for them to deliver to me on 13 August 2019
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4137,AMD laptop still cheaper in markets.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4137,"Talk about reliable wise, just use to it,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4137,cause they are newer in market now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4137,How they proven has not issue
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4137,", anyway just trust on ThinkPad with add up your warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4137,I don’t think that Intel CPU doesn’t needs warranty so far.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4137,"For me that is the options, either AMD or Intel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4137,IF you have more budget go for Intel will do.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4137,I will look forward about AMD performance 😂
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4138,Lol your ordered is faster than me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4139,Another reason going for Ryzen for me is to prevent intel monopoly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4139,Lol 😃
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4140,"Intel is fine, just the CPU runing hot when charging while runing a software."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4140,Mine was i7-8550U
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4140,the exhaust fan runing high speed all the time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,just wanted to share some notes on the E495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,"was deciding between either the E495 or E595, as the price difference was very slight."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,"In the end, choose the 14"" as it is lighter."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,ordered on 23/7 and finally got it on 2/8 late at night.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,impressed with the UPS delivery as they delivered at 9
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,=+ at night.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,upgraded the M2 SSD to Adata XPG SX8200 Pro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,very impressed by the performance!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,did not realize that PCIe gen3x4 NVMe is so much faster compared to traditional SATA SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,cost $120.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,"also upgraded the RAM to Crucial DDR4 2400, 2 sticks of 16GB,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,total 32GB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,cost $190.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,"bought both from SLS, good value for $ upgrades."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,"overall, very impressed with the build quality, the keyboard, the IPS screen, easy to upgrade both the RAM and M2 SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,"also came with the 2.5"" bracket, so I was able to reuse my old 2.5"" SSD from my old laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,"I would say for a $700+ laptop, this is the best value in the market now for the specs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,"especially the FHD IPS screen, the Intel Wireless-AC 9260 2x2 AC, Bluetooth 5.0."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,"consumer grade laptop price, but getting more business grade laptop quality."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,"great keyboard, comfortable to type on for long time, not sure if it is really spill proof like the old generations Thinkpads..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,"but for this price, no complaints."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,"Cons, heavy compared to my previous 13"", but the X395 was a little pricey and not as value for $ as this."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,"no backlit keyboard option on the E495, if they had this, it would have been perfect."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4141,I hope this helps folks out there deciding if they should consider buying this.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4142,"Nice, I decided to go for the E490"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4142,instead
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4142,"but damn your shipping is not bad, I ordered mine on 25/07, was expected to shipped on 2/8"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4142,"but now the expected shipping delayed to 6/8, the wait killing me"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4143,"Casual Games like World of Warships, Starcraft 2 and RTS games."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4143,Trying out older titles like Left 4 Dead 2.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4143,So far the power issue is solved.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4143,Not sure why it is so but will monitor if have any issues.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4144,just ordered the E595.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4144,Upgraded:

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4145,"When i started updating system updates, install Office 2019 and syncing my emails while charging, the laptop is intensely hot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4145,"But after that, its cool."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4145,Fast and Smooth
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4146,"Hahah, no worries"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4160,"NVMe PCIe Opal is better, actually ThinkPad used with Samsung PM981, this is realiable product."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4161,X395 the higher model.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4192,"the wwan option and mobile card already is worth more than $165 i check for other models, dont"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4193,i wonder if the multi touch option for screen is a good choice?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4194,"if onboard is 8, and add another 8gb .. will it be in dual channel"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4195,Hoot Ryzen 5 because of this issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4195,So on board 16GB + another 16GB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4196,Looking at the 8 + 8 option
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4197,Good for you!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4198,Is three year on site free of charge or really $72.50?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4199,Based on what i add.. it puts 72.50
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4200,On board 8 GB can it be taken out and replaced to 16GB coz i wanted to.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4200,upgrade it didnt get from lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4200,thanks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4201,This is soldered on I think.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4201,"1 soldered on, 1 replaceable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4202,Thank you bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4202,So no more 0.01$ three year on-site for today.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4203,"The restocking fee turned me off, will just settle with my E490."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4203,Enjoy to those who are hooting the T495!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4204,It should be soldered on.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4204,not removable iirc
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4205,"After adding the price,
it is still worth it i guess?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4205,cause of the bday coupon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4206,Oh then i can only add another ram in the empty slot ...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4206,i thought i can replaced it to make it 32 GB ...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4206,now i stuck with it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4207,"If you want 32 must go with 16gb option for the onboard..
than the other 16"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4207,i guess u can put in yourself?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4207,Not sure
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4207,"i rather just get 16 + 16 like the other guy if you need, save your trouble."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4208,16GB is enough for all uses.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4208,No need to worry.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4209,oh dear wonder whether i can cancelled the order?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4210,Why?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4210,So good deal today.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4211,You could try live chat
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4211,but they ask me to email to cancel orders.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4212,T495 : 8 or 16gb onboard is selected.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4212,Additional 16gb ram slot for you to add or keep it empty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4212,A. 8gb onboard +
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4212,16gb = 24
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4212,B. 16gb onboard +
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4212,16gb = 32
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4212,C. 16gb onboard like my specs now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4213,Thanks very much for the help
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4214,Agreed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4214,Tks for confirmation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,[Quote].
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,I was wondering whether 16GB will be supported of not.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,"Officially , accourding to Lenovo recommendation this laptop supports 4GBSoldered + 8GBOpen slot ="
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,12GB of total memory.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,But I checked on Crucial offical site what model I would need.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,The site showed me 16GB would be supported
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,so I ordered one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,I put the 16GB in open slot & turned the laptop on.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,WALLAH...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,IT WORKS !!!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,Now I'm getting 4GB +
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,16GB = 20GB of total memory.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,I was facing stuttering while playing Gears of war 4
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,but now the stuttering is gone.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,The RAM gives enough head room for multitasking also & help to run graphics intensive aplications so easily .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,But previously I was getting 30GB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,"/s read & write speed from OEM memory , Now it goes down to 20GB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,/s read & write speed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,Although I am not seeing any issue with this speed
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,but It is quite slow than OEM RAM.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,Anyway 16GB will work on single RAM slot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4215,[unquote]
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4216,Additional ram can buy from amazon or AliExpress

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4217,"Actually 16gb is good than enough, specially for this business laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4217,Again out of market gaming laptop just comes with 16gb of standard specs so far.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4218,Ya too good a deal to miss
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4218,I think i just add another 8 or 16 GB myself
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4219,Thanks for the infor
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4220,the only negative is the display 1080p.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4220,why not 2k display?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4221,very tempted to put in my order
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4222,"You can said, they offer with 400nits for this packaged."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4222,"If compare to Lenovo Malaysia just had 300nits and without backlit keyboard ,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4222,Lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4223,3 hours more to go!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4224,"Forgot to say, please use cashback to login Lenovo and get further discount."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4228,400 nits no multi-touch?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4228,So it's between more nits or touchscreen feature?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4229,Brightness is more important than touch in my opinion.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4230,"Yes they have option for multi touch but the Color accurate very bad, just 42% of SRGB only"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4237,Good deal for T495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4237,😍😍
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4238,I missed the deal !
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4239,yeah
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4239,i did.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4239,thats the problem?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4240,Whats so good about this laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4240,I see dell $1.2k with 1050ti siaz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4241,ThinkPad is known for its durability and if you get the 2-yr premium service package its value for money.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4241,"For Dell, unless you are referring to their Latitude range...."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4241,My opinion only....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4241,Dells Inspiron is comparable to Lenovos IdeaPad range.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4242,Dell keyboard can’t meet a ThinkPad level yet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4242,Dell keyboard touch feeling most likely same as MacBook Pro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4242,"For me ThinkPad keyboard is a bested, like no other."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4242,"Again Dell business laptop more on aluminium case while the ThinkPad on plastic, poly foam mixed with carbon design, much durable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4243,I dont know much about diff model as I used a few before only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4243,Now comparing to dell G3?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4244,"8th Generation Intel® Core™ i5-8300H Processor Quad-Core, 8MB Cache, up to 4.0GHz"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4244,w/ Turbo Boost.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4244,Windows 10 Home
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4244,64 bit English.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4244,2.5 SATA Hard Drive
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4244,"Dell is like the above and is a gaming laptop, the base config is $1,195.00."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4244,T495 is a business class laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4244,"For $1,200 plus actual cost $2.3"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4244,plus you get much more.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4244,"32GB ram, 1TB SSB, WWAN etc all under 1.6kg."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4245,Easy...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4245,"it's a ""thinkpad"" lenovo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4245,"keyboard, quality all of a certain standard."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4245,T series hardly easy to find under 1k for such specs...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4245,The 32gb ram and 1TB SSD option also worth it .. 1.2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4245,+
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4246,Don’t said about 32gb ram
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4246,😂
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4246,😂
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4246,😂
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4246,I miss the chance due to Budget on 1k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4246,Just now bought additional crucial 16gb DDR4 2666mhz from Taobao.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4246,🤭
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4247,Specs may trump E495/E595/T495 since it is using Intel H series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4247,"I myself is using Dell G3 Intel i7, few things to take note:"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4247,"- Surface is rather hot when gaming and fan is loud
-"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4247,Despite it is slim but it is heavy around 2.5kg and a massive power brick.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4247,E495/E595/T495 weights below 2KG
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4247,Build itself is not bad but mostly plastic so to compare with business
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4247,laptops is not a good comparison.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4247,For Dell premium consumer grade laptop would be Dell XPS
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4247,but XPS price you can go for T series instead.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4248,"Must come this space often, lenovo still will churn out AMD laptops more and more"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4249,How often are such promotions ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4250,Still a good deal.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4250,"Dell G3 cannot compare to T series, one is gaming consumer, one is business enterprise."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4250,"Other than a better gpu,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4250,"the other specs and build will lose out to T series, though you wouldn't really buy a T series for gaming other than some light ones."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4250,"want to compare T series, dell business Latitude would be a better comparison imo"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4251,Yesterday I chatted with the support.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4251,He said that he could not provide free three year on-site at no cost .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4251,"However , he could provide three year on site at 1 cent + laser mouse at 1 cent + top load case at 1 cent."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4251,So I placed my order without the three items and he manually added it in for me
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4251,order total increased by 3 cents
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4252,Lenovo generally have the usual promotions quite often..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4252,"During those events like IT shows etc, nightly discounts, anniversary etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4252,"This one was NDP, i guess until next NDP?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4252,Keep a lookout on this thread sometimes
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4253,Shiok!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4253,save even more!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4254,I hope we get dual heatpipe cooling.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4254,for the T495..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4255,I see.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4255,Thanks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4256,Anyway just single heat pipe only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4256,Cause that is business laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4256,Look at T490
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4256,"come with Dua heat pipes, but just single cooling fan only"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4257,Thanks for all feedback
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4258,Yes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4258,This 54% promo for T495 was unprecedented.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4259,Dell G series can do compare with Y series Legion gaming laptop only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4259,But the design too bulky
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4259,😆😆😆
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4260,"This is the highest offer I have seen for a Thinkpad, though I wish it was a T495s version"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4261,"Very bad, I didn’t check with T495s model."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4261,Now the most higher discount code was : COUPO
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4262,T495s do not have 54% discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4262,You could have to cough out $728.86 more!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4263,"Haha, but T495 good enough for me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4263,"As Long this model can have additional ram slot to add on, while the T495s don’t have."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4263,About the weight of T495s is lighter as X395.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4264,Dear all.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4264,I will soon have two windows 7 dinosaur laptops that I will not use.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4264,Can I confirm that generally there is zero resale value?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4265,Maybe if you can somehow upgrade it to win10
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4265,Otherwise.. don't think got much use.. maybe some legacy user will buy and use
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4266,Can you show the model/specs of dinosaur laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4266,Regarding the windows can update easily.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4267,Which models
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4268,any1 know if e595 can run in flex mode?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4268,i have 2x4gb
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4268,would like to change to 1x4gb + 1x8gb
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4268,cos i need more than 8gb but not more than 10 - 11gb
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4269,32gb Max DDR4 2400mhz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4269,"Either 4 + 8 or 4 + 16gb ram , if you have 2666mhz the board just recognise on 2400mhz only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4270,Both are Sony Vaio from many years ago
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4270,bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4270,Very old models.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4270,I don't think Sony make them anymore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4271,Have they updated you on the status?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4271,Sent from null using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4272,Just curious how T495 can have max of 32gb since onboard is fixed at 8gb
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4273,Base package can’t select for extra 16gb onboard.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4273,Step 2 upgrade your APU to 5300.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4273,Step 3 additional 16gb free slot can be add in future or at same time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4273,"Total 32gb ram, 16gb onboard + 16gb ram on addition slot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4274,Thank you Obichaha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4274,This is very detailed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4274,Now I also understand why I don't see it the option is not available for Ryzen 7 combination that I ordered
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4275,nope.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4275,u waiting too?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4276,i skipped the t495 as the screen 1080p nia.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4276,only setback else
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4276,ill pull the trigger
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4277,"Option for T490, T490s and X1 Carbon 7th gen 😍😍😍😍😍"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4278,Yes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4278,Hoping for good news
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4278,Sent from null using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4279,"I am thinking which option should I pick:
1."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4279,Memory - I have an existing HP 4+4 and Lenovo 8+4.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4279,"Memory usage on the Lenovo is around 30% while the HP exceeds 40-45%, and the HP laptop is laggy"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4279,I am unaware if there is any other reasons
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4279,2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4279,"SSD
PCIe-NVMe and NVMe?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4280,Nothing wrong with the screen size to be honest.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4280,"This is a 14 inch laptop, so I don't see the point of getting anything more than 1080p."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4280,The resolution is about as high as the onboard graphics can support anyway.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4281,Ryzen 7 CPU have 8GB soldered on RAM while Ryzen 5 can select 16GB RAM.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4282,You should add for 8x2 = 16gb dual channel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4282,Ssd
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4282,"256gb is a minimun, but that is fast."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4283,"Miss the deal, now best px is 1500"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4283,=+!Boohoo
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4284,Just do my customize same specs as your.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4284,"The minimum was 1.8k,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4284,how you get from 1.5++?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4285,How you manage 1500?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4285,got another discount code?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4285,same config now around 2k
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4286,same.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4286,probably got to wait till tomorrow already
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4287,Thank you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4287,But will 4+8 = 12gb be sufficient?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4287,"How does the RAM work actually, as in which RAM will the computer it utilize first, whichever RAM on the 1st slot?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4288,Yes 12gb good than enough.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4288,If you have extra Budget go for 16gb more than enough.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4288,Usually graphic card will taken from total of 30% memory.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4288,So your efficient memory just left about 70% only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4289,8 + 4 and not 8 + 8?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4289,Don't want dual channel or do this laptop don't use dual channel?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4290,"Laptop working for combined of total Ram, doesn’t mean do you want the Dual channel of the same memory, either 4 + 8 or 8+8 or 4+16gb, cause some of the laptop comes with 4GB onboard, after added with 16gb ram, you can have more multi tasking."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4291,Thanks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4291,I am considering E495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4291,My Lenovo G40 has 4 slots I suppose.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4291,"Slot 1 8GB,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4291,"Slot 2 Empty, Slot 3 4GB, Slot 4 Empty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4291,Speed 1600MHz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4292,"Yes you can consider for E495, if you can get cheaper now."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4302,"No just remain as Win 10,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4302,"cause never use linux before , I have many software is supported by windows only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4303,I see.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4303,"I am currently using macOS, prefer Linux/unix kind of system."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4303,Windows not really my thing
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4304,"So many years used with MAC OS , I felt that windows more suitable for me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4304,Cause I can do more thing than MacOS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4305,Mine ship on 24th 😍
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4306,I received my mouse and bag liaooo
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4307,Same by today
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4308,It really depends on your usage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4308,"For most folks, 8GB is more than sufficient, so 12GB is good enough."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4309,"Even though the rams are not the same size, it will still run in dual channel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4309,Its not like the old days where you need to get matched pair of rams in order to run them in dual channel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4310,Not aware of that
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4310,or else I would have picked the Ryzen 7 CPU with 8GB soldered on.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4310,Haizzz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4311,What did u picked?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4312,"My P1 Gen 2 comes with 64gb ram , open 3 revit model and one autocad 2018."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4312,The ram for 16gb more than enough.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4313,Whoa the specs are 🔥
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4313,🔥🔥
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4313,The ram comes in 2 x 32 GB sticks or did you upgrade yourself cos its v ex to go with customised option on site..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4313,Asking cos
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4313,I am thinking of buying 32gb ram sticks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4313,but cnt find
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4314,"Yup, I’m customised on site, 32gb single stick still can get."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4314,Samsung or SK Hynix only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4314,But the price for single stick included shipping around $300 each can consider upgrade your new SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4314,Show you recent 1TB SSD speed from Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4314,They used Samsung PM981a OEM.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4314,The speed is incredible 😍😍
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4315,Ryzen 5 and 32 GB loh
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4316,Anyone got shipping updates for T495s yet?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4316,I did not get any update so far.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4317,The laptop will only arrive on 29 August.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4318,My T495 just got shipped out of the Hebei factory.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4318,Waiting for UPS to update on the scheduled date in Singapore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4319,My also shipped out already
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4320,"Why we all order at same day , my ship out on 24th Aug for T495 🤔🤔"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4321,Depends on config and availability of parts?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4322,"Haha , I think so, cause mine has maximum customised , just except on 32gb Ram."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4323,Mine too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4323,My one also 23rd then sent out for delivery
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4324,There is one section when ordering where there's red text that said sent after 2 weeks .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4324,Maybe they are waiting for stocks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4325,"Just checked again, mine not shipped yet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4325,Anyone else ordered T495s instead of T495 here?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4326,Just got mine for t495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4326,lol 😝

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4329,Gonna read up some comparison then decide which to get.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4330,Wasted.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4330,Missed the National Day Promo for T495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4331,"Hi all,
For the T495,
I would like to ask, can the SSD be partition eg:"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4331,"512GB into 2 drives eg C: drives, D:drive?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4331,Thnks!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4332,"Sure Can , try to watch from YouTube 😍"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4333,"Hi obichacha,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4333,Thnks for the enlightenment!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4334,My Thinkpad is E495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4334,"So now I can't get M.2 2280 SSD, have to get 2242."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4334,But options are limited.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4334,It seem Toshiba is offering it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4335,The shipping is delayed?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4335,Now shipping on 5 Sept.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4336,When will shipping date be available usually?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4336,I ordered on 14 Aug after follow up on the bug on 9 Aug. Received the mouse and case today.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4336,"However, still no date on the 'expected to ship' field in the order status."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4337,You can try to contact Lenovo
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4338,Not much choices now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4338,Can get from Taobao 512gb by Lenovo
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4338,"I have buy from Taobao, if u want can help u buy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4339,This time it's about 1 month.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4339,Maybe no stock.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4340,What can do?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4340,"Wanna get cheap and good specs , just wait will do."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4340,"Mine estimate ship out on 30Aug, just got updated."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4341,didn't know that until today.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4341,on both Intel and AMD platform?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4342,My shipping postponed from 19 August to 11 September
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4343,My still on the way.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4343,No change in date.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4343,Specs wise different
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4343,that's why probably faster.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4344,Mine arrived in Singapore this morning but scheduled delivery is still end of 22 Aug Thur.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4345,Which model?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4345,Have u customised?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4345,Why so fast.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4346,T495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4346,Customised.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4346,Ryzen 7.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4347,Thanks bud for the information.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4347,Can u PM
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4347,the seller u bought from instead?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4347,I'm getting other stuff from TB as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4347,One if it is an ssd enclosure.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4348,"Haha never bought yet, you can do a search , they have plenty of seller."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4348,🤣
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4349,"Hello, can i ask if i want to extend my e595 to two monitors, do i REALLY need a docking station or is there an cheaper alternative?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4349,Thanks in advance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4350,Comes with HDMI port and PD type C for display port.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4350,You need to buy display port / hdmi cable to type c cable for 2nd monitor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4351,"Thank you, so in short, i need to buy one more cable"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4351,right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4351,sorry I am noob.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4351,I know the dock is plug in and
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4351,wala.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4351,"also, maybe dock is more neat?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4352,Go shopee look at Baseus or Ugreen type C docking if you want.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4352,But price is more or less $30>
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4353,thank you!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4353,will go check it out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4354,whoa.. i'm surprised!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4354,received my T495!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4354,First impressions.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4354,- light.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4354,- material more premium than E series even the keyboard.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4354,- speaker grill on the top versus below of E series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4354,- the usb-c port on the left is slightly awkward.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4354,=- SSD is WDC NOT samsung
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4354,- out of box is 1809 windows.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4354,"Should be I see wrongly, not 1803."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4354,Lots to update until you get to 1903.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4354,Don't forget to load Lenovo vantage after that to load the rest of the stuff.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4354,=- highest nit screen seems like the correct choice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4355,"lol, i want to pull trigger then now"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4355,like dun have second option of SSD for E495/595.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4355,sian
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4356,Hi may I know what’s WDC ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4356,Never heard before 🤔🤔
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4357,I think is western digital
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4358,"Western Digital, FYI"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4358,they brought over Sandisk so some Sandisk SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4358,products are identical with their WD counterpart.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4359,"WD not bad wor, think to get their Black."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4359,SN750 for my backup drive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4360,Sorry I have the question:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4360,How many gigabyte you bought they packed with WD ssd?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4360,Thanks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4361,Damn missed the ndp promo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4361,Wait for bf sales
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4362,When is “bf” sale?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4363,What is the ndp promo?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4363,I missed out on it too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4363,Sent from lalaland using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4364,Received my T495 yesterday evening.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4364,Factory installed OS Win 10 1809.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4364,Now installing and configuring the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4365,Black Friday sale on 29th Nov
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4366,"512gb, that's why shipped faster."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4367,54% off for AMD selected models
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4368,Not just AMD processor models.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4368,T495 and T495s with AMD processors and Thinkbook 13s with Intel processors.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4369,Actually I’m miss out to look at T495s lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4369,Nvm..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4370,"Except for weight, I guess T495 is better since T495s max RAM is only 16GB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4371,"Maybe i refer to this thread , they all go for T495 and do upgrade all Max specs on 32GB ram."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4371,Probably is one of the reason.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4372,I think for E595 isn’t that cheap?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4373,What is the price for T495 after discount?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4374,Less than 1.1k for mine
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4375,54% will cost less than 2k.even if you hoot the highest specs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4375,"Jin song, and hard to come by offer."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4376,The speed of the wdc SSD is slower than the samsung one..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4376,FYI
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4376,"i'm okay with it though, still speedy for me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4377,32gb is not possible for those who chose Ryzen 7.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4377,"Therefore if you max out the processor, iroNically you can't max out the ram."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4378,But still better than T495s Max 16gb only 😆
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4379,The option to choose 2nd hard drive for E495 has been removed ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4380,The thing is E495 without any ssd for selection.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4380,"If you has remove the HDD, is consider no come with any windows"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4380,", u need to install by yourself with get Sata 3 2.5” ssd install your own."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4381,Previously the option to choose 2nd hard drive was there.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4382,Don’t seem they have 2nd option.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4382,Maybe they no longer selling 2242 m.2 ssd
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4383,"Hi all,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4383,I know this idea might be far fetch
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4383,and there is no harm trying.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4383,I am one of those bros who missed out on the 54% off the T495 promo on 09 Aug.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4383,"I will be posting on Lenovo FB home page, to ask them can they consider bringing back the promo again for the upcoming IT show on 05th Sep."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4383,"Hopefully, with ppl supporting, Lenovo might consider bringing back the promo, of a similar discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4383,Thnks for reading.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4383,Wishing everyone a great weekend!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4384,Default is 128GB SSD with no HDD selected.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4384,Do check using their online chat.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4384,"This was what I was told in the online chat last week, but I did not confirm since just asking only"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4385,I alps.missed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4385,Will support if u post
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4386,"Probably they want to push the 2 day models, E495/E595 there is a SKU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4386,that can be delivered within 2 days.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4386,These SKU have SSD but not customization.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4386,"Or maybe they noticed, most opt for HDD than add in their own SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4386,Cheaper that way than going for Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4387,I just realise that E495/595 if you come into customise they
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4387,no Ssd for selected🤭
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4387,"Most likely they force you to get from ADD packaged, then can enjoy the shipping time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4387,Price more or less are the same.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4388,"My 1TB SSD is of the make ""SAMSUNG MZVLB1T0HBLR-000L7""."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4389,"Wow, how come u got your faster than us?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4389,Mine still awaiting till 30/8
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4389,then ship out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4390,2 lane or 4 lane PCIE?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4391,Samsung PM981.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4391,Sorry is PM981a same as mine from P1 Gen 2.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4391,Read write speed
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4392,Not sure bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4392,My config was Ryzen 7 + 16gb
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4392,+ 1tb ssd + IR screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4392,Not sure if this affects the lead time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4392,It was attempted delivery two days ago on Thursday 22 Aug
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4392,but I was not home.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4392,So I received on second attempt on friday 23 Aug.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4392,"As my three year on site was a manual addition by the CSO for 1 cent , I had to register the laptop - choose ""electronic"" at the bottom of registration screen instead of ""none"" or ""hardcopy"" - and enter a pin code and authorisation code sent via email for the three year on site."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4393,Bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4393,Not sure.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4393,I don't know how to check.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4393,Maybe I will check CrystalDisk later just finished vacuuming the floor and am very sweaty now
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4393,Good to know that there is a concept of lanes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4393,Tks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4394,Meaning less ppls will get the Ryzen 7 pro model..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4394,🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4394,You’re the smarter
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4395,"Upgrade Liao, get Irobot Roomba or Roboking , my house using roboking , that’s very helpful for me"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4396,"A few days ago, I have posted the request already in their FB to show interest."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4396,At least we try to show Lenovo there is interest to revive the promo again.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4396,"Although it will not be 54% discount, 20% or more discount is still better than nothing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4396,"I hope there will be supporters for it, so the chance might be there."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4396,Thnks for yr support in reading my post.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4397,"Hi Bro,
I would like to ask, after negotiation with the CS for the 1 cent, 3 yr on site warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4397,"Did you have to complete the payment process first, then provide the Lenovo CS"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4397,your transaction
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4397,no?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4397,"Can you pls share with me the steps of the procedure, so I know what to do when I intend to buy the T495?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4397,thnks!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4398,Hi Bro
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4398,"They will charge into your credit card , but in the pending status."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4398,Until they shipped mouse or bag and withdraw the laptop amount from your card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4398,After they ship out the laptop then recharge again.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4398,"Mean you buy now and pay next month or another month, due to delay the shipping date."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4399,Thanks bro
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4399,On Aircon
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4399,cool down cool down
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4400,"Hi obichacha,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4400,Thnks!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4401,Thanks guys.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4401,Hope they put back the SSD option again
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4402,Yes bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4402,You are right.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4402,"In detail these steps were:
- I told CSO I will buy Ryzen 7 only if it came with three year on-site as an incentive/trade-off for Ryzen 7 not being able to configure 32gb
-"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4402,He agreed and asked me to place an order without the three year on site.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4402,The order total was 1063.06 and card was charged for a unconfirmed amount of 1063.06.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4402,"- Thereafter, he could ""see"" my order and manually added mouse +laptop +three year warranty for ""free""."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4402,However I could see that it was actually not free since it was one cent each
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4402,"and now my order total is 1063.06+0.03=1063.09.
- upon shipment"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4402,", I my card was charged with 1063.09 instead of 1063.06."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4403,"Hi Bro,
thnks!"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4419,"Hi all,
I am thinking of getting the T495"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4419,but I am not sure which option to choose
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4419,Should i get
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4419,1 AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 3700U Processor or AMD Ryzen 5 Pro 3500U Processor ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4419,"2 14.0"" FHD 1920 x 1080, IPS, Anti-Glare, 300nits, Multi-touch or 14.0"" FHD 1920x1080, IPS, 400nits, Anti-Glare"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4419,I am mostly using for work and creation working using mostly Adobe illustrator and slightly use of Photoshop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4419,Hope you guys can help on this
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4420,Get 3700U or 3500U come with 16gb Ram.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4420,Actually no regret to add on from 400nits display.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4420,Higher brightness will help u see clearly in dark area.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4421,Yup... probably next week will get it on hand.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4421,"Actually I just got my X395 on hand ,
Thinking to let go my T495 🤣🤣🤣"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4422,"Lol,  why get so many?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4422,To sell?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4423,"X395 for my Wife actually, she don’t want and give me used."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4423,My T495 waiting too Long.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4423,What can do?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4423,No point to keep many right!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4424,First impression with Vega 8 - can play CS:GO medium settings at 60 FPS on 1080p monitor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4424,Much better than Intel integrated graphics.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4425,ThinkPad bring nice specs for us.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4425,I am love it so much
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4426,Actually 300 nits is already very bright.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4426,"Most of the time, you likely will only be using to close to 150 to 200 nits."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4426,"Even for outdoor, 300 nits with a matt screen will work."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4426,400 nits in the dark is too bright especially when sitting very close to the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4427,"Hahah, get the most highly brighter you have no regret."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4427,At least can adjust as you want.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4427,Yup exactly 300nits is good than enough.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4428,300 nits is not bright enough fo some.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4428,There are other laptops with 500 nits.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4429,"For me 250nits display brightness is something too dim, try to get higher as you can."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4429,😂
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4430,Thanks for all your ans
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4430,I roughly knows what to get.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4430,I wait for this week
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4430,PC shows see if there is additional discounts on Lenovo website before getting a purchase.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4431,"If you are using it for Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, it's better to get the non-touch screen with 400 nits brightness."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4431,The multi-touch panel with 300 nits brightness has only 45% color gamut while the non-touch panel with 400 nits brightness has 72% color gamut.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4432,Received my set this morning.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4432,The T495 is a great improvement from the E585 in terms of build quality.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4433,How come nobody use the small business sign in to get 20% discount...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4433,Can use shopback somemore
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4434,Cause nobody has company.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4434,🤔🤔
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4435,"Yup, whoever take 250nits to 300nits the Color too bright and dim.. don’t really get the corrected Color for the overall views."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4435,Just except on 400nits come with 72% of gamut.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4435,This is help a lot for viewing in photos editing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4436,"We bought when there is 54% discount plus using shopback, there's another 100 plus."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4437,"Get the highest nits, cause the color is the best for the options I think."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4437,I using the brightest so far I find it good for the price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4438,Can someone share where is the best place and method to buy ThinkPad ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4438,Through Lenovo website itself/online malls/physical electronics store
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4438,/IT shows?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4438,I'm thinking of extending their 1year base warranty to 3 years which seem to be the pricing sweet spot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4438,Slightly confused by the 3 different upgrades:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4438,"Carry-In, Onsite, Premier OnSite."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4438,which wty upgrade do you guys recommend?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4439,Online is the best place.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4439,"Physical store wise, you cannot configure the specs to your liking and."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4439,not able to use promo codes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4439,=
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4439,"- Carry in means anything wrong with the laptop, you have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 to Carry it to the service center."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4439,Which is in Paya lebar for what I know.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4439,=- Onsite means anything wrong they come down to fix
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4439,=- Premium Onsite this warranty is Suitable for business than home users.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4439,"What this means is expect ""Next day"" service without waiting for parts and etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4439,Onsite warranty will do fine for home users unless you are buying to use at.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4439,work than get Premium onsite.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4439,The type of Warranty also applies to other manufactures like Dell and HP.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4440,Thanks for the very informative reply on warranties!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4440,"btw, how do you guys ask for further discount from the CSO?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4440,Do they give discount on top of whatever eCoupon code alr on web sitite?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4440,e.g. 'TECHSHOW' at the moment
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4441,Have to wait for others to comment.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4445,"Everything can do, such as doing the design work or engineering or light architecture model from autodesk Revit or autocad or some contractor software as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4445,The best part is cpu fan rarely kick in.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4445,Make you u add on 16gb ram and 300nits display will do.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4445,Currently installed the HD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4445,clear screen protector looks like glossy as X1 Carbon HDR display.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4445,Also applied carbon sticker to avoid scratches
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4446,Dummy hdd they will remove the Sata cable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4446,Unless you leave it as 5400rpm hdd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4446,Nope they won’t void your warranty
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4446,cause
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4446,you didn’t touch the rest like CPU or motherboard parts else.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4447,so does anyone think the COMEX offers are good/worth?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4447,or is online order still better priced?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4447,"btw, when you guys mention ShopBack here, you all referring to the coupon code @ shopback.sg?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4447,how do you guys ask for more discount through CSO on top of coupon code?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4448,Take note COMEX and retail shops don't carry AMD laptops.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4448,like Thinkpad E495/E595.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4448,If you are looking at Intel based laptop with better pricing than.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4448,head down to COMEX.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4452,The customized ones indicate 'Ships in more than 4 weeks' while the 2-days delivery one pre-configured abit too basic for my needs
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4453,Sorry which is your model?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4454,Yup you need to play awaiting games more than 3-4 weeks after you place your ordered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4455,"Hi obichacha,"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4460,all depends on which cso...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4461,Anyone have issues with missing keystrokes on E495?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4461,Think this issue was there with E495 until a BIOS update fixed it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4461,Any idea if this happens on T495 and X395 as well?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4462,Everything should be solve after windows 1903 version with Lenovo vantage update will be going well
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4463,"Probably when I buy, I will try my luck and upfront request CSO for $0.10 for 3 yrs warranty."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4468,"When i try customize E495 or E595, it doesn't have the option to customize the 2nd hard drive because i want ssd + hard drive combo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4468,They only have option to choose what capacity hard drive you want only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4468,Ridiculous
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4468,fooking lame.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4471,Will it really charge faster?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4471,Looking at E595.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4472,"Charge faster, especially needed for E585"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4473,"For some reasons, this option is gone."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4473,"Try to buy outside, it should be cheaper too, and you'll have more options."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4474,Get 65w instead of 45w charger
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4475,was told they do not have stock

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4482,So what can i expect the laptop to come with?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4482,Is the Radeon vega 6 the default integrated graphics?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4483,The vega graphics is considered integrated gpu
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4483,"I think, like the intel 630 graphics on the i7 9750H  line"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4484,Ok got it!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4484,Thks for the info!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4485,"for t495, onboard or added ram better?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4486,"Max out the onboard since its not user up-gradable , the added ram can install yourself."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4487,"Max it 16gb onboard, in future can add another 16gb by yourself"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4488,"Don’t take TN panel, you will regret"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4489,thx guys!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4489,10 char
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4490,"Many generations have passed, Athlon Era like Athlon XP tend to overheat."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4490,"Ryzen is a completely new CPU, DIY space it is selling very well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4490,Need not worry about overheat but Intel will be a different story.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4491,"Depend on your budget, best onboard + added ram for dual channel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4491,That means 8 X 2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4491,or you can get onboard 8GB than buy from outside additional RAM.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4492,Just pulled the trigger on T495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4492,Around $1150 if shopback is successful.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4492,"The sales were really really tight, they won't budge on adding extra % or freebies."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4492,It's going to be my first Thinkpad
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4493,Double9 sales for today only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4494,"actually with the 39% off, think cheaper to get from lenovo, no?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4495,Additional crucial 16gb ddr 4 selling $85-90.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4495,But if come with onboard either 8 or 16gb make sure added to max.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4496,"Oh yes the current 9 9 sale, better take advantage of it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4497,Already ordered bro..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4497,haha..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4497,Anyway i like my screens dark..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4498,"Hahah, dark is ok, just a bit grey color."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4498,Cause TN panel just come with 45% gamut only
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4499,Suggest you to cancel the order and get the Full HD IPS panel instead.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4499,Or ask CSO whether can change the order or not.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4499,TN screen not only dark but
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4499,the LCD panel picture quality is worse.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4499,than IPS panel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4499,It's up to your preference anyway.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4500,"Haha I had my previous experience, i always adjust the color setting to suit from my eyes, end up sold the whole laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4500,Cause really cannot take it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4500,Looks sometime my eyes very uncomfortable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4500,Actually in this thread can found many previous user they asking about replace to IPS panel as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4501,Yeah i understand what u mean.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4501,My requirements for screens are very basic..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4501,So probably wont bother me that much.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4503,X395 is lighter and better battery life
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4503,also 300nits display.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4503,T495 battery life around 7 hours full charged and slightly heavy weight.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4503,Screen wise 250nits not as good as X395.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4506,"I used the T490 300 nits and E490 250nits display unit as a reference, I found the 250 nits too dim."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4506,"Since Lenovo today, have a decent discount, decided to take the 400 nits option."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4523,"Since this was a sale, our shipment could be even longer than lead time due to surge in volume."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4524,"Now they set the shipping period to 4 weeks, so long!"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4540,"For business/education, reseller/distributor also reluctant to quote AMD laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4540,That leave only online store as the only place to buy AMD laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4541,"Hi all, just nice wanted to buy a laptop for my work usage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4541,Is this the minimum setup I should consider for x395?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4541,Thanks in advance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4542,I think that 16GB RAM good for future since can't add on any more
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4542,Win
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4542,10 pro
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4542,"not necessary you need it, but"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4542,RAM you need it more than Windows upgrade.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4543,Thanks for the suggestion.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4543,Seems like I missed the 9/9 deal.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4543,Currently it's 1.5k with all the listed specs.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4546,"If AMD is improving in performance, why is there the reluctance?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4547,"Many factors:
- There is still perception that AMD CPU is slow and hot
-"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4547,AMD OEM products don't sell well
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4547,so most don't carry
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4547,=- most prefer Intel than amd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4547,"Walk into any retail shop, If you ask their opinion about amd laptop"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4547,they will quote the above.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4547,"For Ryzen to rise in OEM/Retail channel may take time, since."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4547,AMD reputation over a decade isn't that good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4547,I myself the only user who uses AMD since.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4549,Found here is TLC.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4549,"Can replace for Samsung 970 Evo Plus in future, I think doesn’t"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4549,bigger issue
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4550,"I am going to try out AMD for the first time, so hope the experience will be good.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4551,Make sure to get Ryzen Pro 3500U or 3700U to save your time

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4554,"pro and non-pro , very big difference ah ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4555,In the specs for E series didn’t mentioned on Pro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4555,But T & X has Pro
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4555,", I’m confused 😐"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4556,"Those OPAL is Samsung PM981A, I did share before"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4557,"Don't worry like obichacha shared, get either Ryzen 5/7 for best performance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4558,"oic , so this one should be fast"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4558,la.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4558,then no need for me to buy 970 pro
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4559,Performance wise between both is more or less the same.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4559,Only pro chips have security features and longer part availability.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4560,"just asking if this X395, can it plug in e-gpu ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4561,"All AMD models doesn’t had thunderbolt from Intel device, wait for next gen USB"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4572,"The accessories were shipped from hongkong though UPS, my colleague ordered couple of weeks back and were shipped through Tiong Nam which I think were locally stocked."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4572,Looks like a lot of people purchased during the sale.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4572,"Hopefully the laptop is delivered earlier than the estimate, probably next week"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4572,if it's really within 2 weeks shipped from the order date.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4577,Been looking for new reviews for the T495!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4578,Can check for X395 is the maximum ram I can put onboard
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4578,is 16GB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4578,I cant add on more RAM ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4579,"16gb onboard, must be configured before you check out."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4580,weird uh...seldom see x395 reviews
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4581,Thanks Obichacha can I add above 16GB by myself ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4582,Only left E495 and X395 review.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4583,"I got YouTube reviews , do you want?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4583,But for X395 only
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4584,"Can’t, X395 or X390, T490s and"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4584,T495s or X1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4584,"Carbon 7th gen all comes with onboard, meaning the Ram is soldered onboard."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4584,Actually the idea is come from macbook 🙊

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4586,😂
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4586,😂
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4586,Got here only
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4587,Hello!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4587,Me too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4587,You ordered during 9.9 sales?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4588,just ordered 16GB RAM and delivered within 2 hours.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4588,should be compatible based on their site:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4589,How much where do u order?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4590,$115 from Amazon Prime Singapore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4590,"The unit itself is from Convergent Systems who is the official distributor, so no worries about the warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4590,"I was looking around for the cheapest one, found on shopee"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4590,but it looked dodgy they priced them at $104 only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4590,Took a look around qoo10 and lazada from reputable stores like  video-pro and convergent systems and it was around $120-$130ish.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4590,I read something about the AMD Vega consuming some RAM and also better with dual channel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4590,"Didn't think of this when configuring the system during the sales, so ordered separately just now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4590,"At lenovo site the 16GB addon was additional $180, but with the 39% will be $110."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4590,so not much diff buying it separately  fortunately.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4591,"Bought mine from Taobao, included shipped around $90"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4592,Is there a noticable performance boost with dual channel?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4593,Actually can’t feel like changed ssd from lower speed to high end speed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4593,Ram help for multi-tasking and open/close more faster with runs more software at same time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4594,Just nice got IT fair promo

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4596,"looks like the Lenovo mouse and bag would be delivered on 14th Sep.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4597,ok lah fair enuff.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4597,soldered on board = thinner =
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4597,which is true
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4597,u won't wanna see ur note 10+ be as thick as a laptop

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4598,lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4598,Lelomo very big company
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4598,leh
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4599,Any idea about the heat?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4599,Is there any heat problem especially if it's gonna be left running like 24/7 constantly
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4599,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4600,"Of course there is hotter and warm on palmrest, even you left it inside the aircon room."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4600,Even tho intel models
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4601,Suggest go for desktop than laptop if you intend to run 24/7.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4602,yah desktop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4602,if u wanna run 24/7.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4602,i never off my pc before since i built it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4603,Have you clean those dirt on all fan blade?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4604,i got filters on my casing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4604,so i just need to change filter nia
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4605,Either put air filter or buy air blower
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4605,Which can be brought at Challenger.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4606,Nice 👍 feel like a server
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4607,Desktop will have higher power consumption  esp when you leave it powered on 24/7
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4608,Can choose power supply with lower watts or down clock
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4608,Posted from PCWX using POCOPHONE F1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4609,There is power efficient desktop that uses Intel T series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4609,But these desktop are rather pricey.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4609,AMD also have power efficient under Ryzen E series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4609,However that is exclusive to OEM and cease to exist anymore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4609,"Since with their new 7nm CPU, it is much power efficiency."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4610,"No, the lower/higher wattage power supply has been debunked."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4610,What you need is a power supply that is more efficient.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4610,Look at the efficiency curve with your usage if you want to save every last watt.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4610,Downclocking will lower power consumption but ultimately laptop will still draw less power.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4610,It depends on what you are doing with the laptop turned on 24/7 and your use case anyways.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4611,"Ah, I am unaware of that T series chip."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4611,"Either ways, I see no reasons why laptops cant be used as 24/7 rigs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4611,"If anyone is concerned about heat, a laptop that has good thermal design can efficiently remove the heat produced and will have no problem running 24/7."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4611,"As for battery degradation, get a lenovo/asus idk if asus does it as well, there are ppl who say it does."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4611,do your research if you intend to go with asus and turn on conservation mode to allow the laptop to draw power from the wall instead of the battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4612,Are you work in IT 🤔🤔
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4612,Why keep laptop run on 24/7?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4612,Anyway just remove that battery will do.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4613,"Some of the laptops, the battery can't be removed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4614,My issue with Asus is that the chio zenbook uses fan-less cooling and non-removeable batt.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4614,Motherboard overheated despite low usage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4614,Now its an expensive paperweight.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4615,"Lenovo can disable battery, make sure plug in power adapter for all time, following remove out the battery."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4616,Yes some laptop the battery cannot be removed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4616,"Brand like Dell, you can set the laptop to run from AC."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4616,"But even so, the battery will wear out overtime."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4617,"So sad I missed the deal, even though I got the E595 earlier."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4617,"I am not happy with the E595, might consider a change."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4618,Can you share that E595 can install the NVMe PCIe ssd instead of m.2 ssd
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4619,"Nope not me, another forumer asking if should use laptop or desktop for 24/7 ops"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4619,I replied saying laptop will work fine too
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4620,"While this is true, however a desktop is generally more efficient in getting things done since it runs much faster, and can then go back to idle mode."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4620,"Moreover, you don't have to get a very high end desktop with high power PSU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4620,Its possible to setup an Ryzen 2400G rig with a 150W power supply.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4621,Just received the mouse and topload laptop bag.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4622,turns out my company ordered the T495s and not the x395.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4622,just received it this morning
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4623,Received the accessories too or with the laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4624,yeap came with the LAN docket I ordered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4624,"65W power brick in order to have that ""fast charge"" ability"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4625,I am assuming you ordered way before the 9.9 sales?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4625,how long it took for you to receive the shipment email from the date of ordering?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4625,and how long did the shipping took to reach you?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4626,My T495 delayed to 03 Oct. typical Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4626,LOL
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4626,Guess this the norm for T495 sales order.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4627,according to my finance.... placed order on 9.9.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4627,12.09 got shipping order.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4627,supposed to received on 18
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4627,but we were surprised it came in this morning
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4628,probably they prioritize the same specs bulk/ biz orders.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4629,probably.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4629,anyway...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4629,IT guy not around to set the laptop up today for admin access.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4629,but the laptop IS REALLY NICE.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4629,the laptop hinge has been re-designed to allow single finger to lift the screen open
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4630,Pls help to take a photo of your T495 for sharing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4630,Thnks!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4631,Really?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4631,Why X395 can’t do that.. still need to hold on body then lift the screen up
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4632,I am surprised that the single hand opening is possible with T495s.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4632,I have seen a fair bit of T495s reviews
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4632,and i don't remember any of them talking about t495s single hand opening.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4632,I only remember Lew unboxed therapy talking about it with the X1 carbon 7th gen

Thnks for sharing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4634,Ugreen 65w usb c pd charger on Lazada can charge t495s?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4635,"If your t495s is still under warranty, try not to use 3rd party power brick"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4635,cuz it will Auto void the warranty

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4636,"Anker 100W Pd4 can charge also, just draw from 65W max current only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4636,there is same as iPhone 18W Pd an even 65W still chargeable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4637,"There is depending, cause thunderbolt 3 can supply 100W Pd for any laptop, if this one Lenovo claim can’t use , mean all those Intel model no longer has thunderbolt 3 port connection already"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4638,I will always suggest to check with Lenovo especially if your laptop is pretty new with valid warranty
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4638,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4639,BTW
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4639,I’m first time to heard about use with 3rd party power adapter can be void the warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4639,Even tho self replace SSD/Ram they can void your warranty as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4639,Anyway those PD power delivery is varies current supply’s.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4639,"Except those old sch type power brick can only use with the original one, due to 3rd party can’t given 100% accurately voltage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4640,"He probably meant if there is a power surge, it is not covered under warranty"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4641,Just received my laptop bag + mouse from UPS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4642,Anyway just use whatever you can.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4642,"I have no comments,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4642,cause since I did mine quite sometime already.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4642,"So far so good, I use with xiaomi & ugreen and Anker PD as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4643,"Anyway if you worry about that, please do with live chat and get the proper result."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4643,Lenovo will help you to clarify.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4644,this is what I meant.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4644,using an unauthorized 3rd party charger always have the risk to cause damages to the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4644,"and if the damage prevents the laptop from powering up or display weird issues, Lenovo has the right to charge for servicing or even decline to service the laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4644,anyway....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4644,"it is always the consumer's own risk to use 3rd party products which are not approved by the company, especially charger."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4645,"Off course your company laptop, company not allow mean don’t use any 3rd party, settle."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4650,Just except my ThinkPad P1 workstation could not use lower than 135W power supply.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4651,The Lenovo original 65w adaptor is already small enough.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4651,The cable also long enough.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4651,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4652,"wao kao, the delivery date became 17th October lol"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4652,i bought
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4652,my x280 & x1 carbon 6th gen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4652,both customised was delivered within 2 weeks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4652,is this x395 too cheap for them to process faster
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4653,Believe me nowadays X395 overwhelming than the T495 😅🤣🤣🤣
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4653,"Cause it’s lightweight laptop and affordable price, performance wise is damn good."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4653,"Just don’t complain about the chassis and quality of surface very plastics feel, can get scratches easily."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4653,Even tho that shipping box container can leave a mark on lcd front cover.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4653,😑
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4654,any lobang where to get evo plus 1tb on the cheaper side?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4654,local stocks are around $450++.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4654,and are you 'Benefon' by any chance?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4654,there's a lot of similarities lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4654,wow.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4654,"17th october, is it still within the stated shipping estimate on their product page?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4655,"Got, can get from China TB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4655,only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4655,Nope
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4655,that benefon is phototype 🙊😂
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4655,😂😬
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4656,How much did the 1TBs costs?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4657,"If you wish to use third party charger,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4657,No one is stopping you from doing so.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4657,But laptop usually have specific charger to be used with it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4657,"Wattage, current have to be within specs to power the laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4657,Else it will affect many components like mainboard and battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4657,Mainboard is the most costly to replaced.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4657,Lenovo themselves have their own power bank for Thinkpad but pricey.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4657,As well as there is docking station that uses Thunderbolt or USB to be powered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4657,I know some don't like to carry the power adapter.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4657,If can carry one universal charger for  everything that would be better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4657,"Sorry to say this, please don't treat laptop like smartphone."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4657,Smartphone you can play around with different charger.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4657,Laptop wise you have to be careful.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4658,$3XX included shipping loh
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4658,Pm me
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4658,we go another room
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4659,"the link u showed is 45W, is there a 65W model?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4659,"ps - ok, i found it"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4660,AliExpress got 65W model.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4660,But can't show the link here
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4660,😘
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4660,Even tho shopee also have
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4661,"yes, i googled and saw a few."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4661,thanks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4662,I think will wait for Black Friday and see if the prices go down.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4662,"Currently on Amazon Prime, the 1TB costs S$304 with free shipping."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4662,"There's one 65W GaN chargers, one of them is SlimQ on indiegogo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4662,Their plug is the US 2 pin unretractable though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4662,"But if you look at the form factor, it really is slim like a mobile phone charger."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4662,"The thing that worries me about these chargers from ugreen, baseus, slimq, xiaomi are their safety certifications."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4662,Are they really safe?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4662,and are they certified?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4662,Those 2 pin plugs somehow looks less safe than the 3 pin plugs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4663,"Ya almost that price, you can look for WD sn750 slightly cheaper to compare with 970 Evo Plus."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4663,"I had done few of them, for those come with 65W PD supply,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4663,"so far so good, cause Lenovo vantage can set on stop after complete charged."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4663,"There is no issue for me, if you worry better do not try."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4663,"For my case , if going for outdoor , I will bring my xiaomi 2pin 65W PD alone with me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4663,Just in case my laptop run out of battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4663,At home can use that original 65W type C adapter to save your life.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4663,Since it’s free come from the packaged.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4664,"hi guys, during customization, there's an option to choose the power cord."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4664,i chose the 65W thinking it will come with the 65W power adapter....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4664,did i make a mistake here?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4665,Yup come with 3 pin UK plug
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4666,i meant changing the option on the power cord will change the power adapter too?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4666,"ps - just checked delivery status and yes, it's included."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4666,apologies for confusion
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4666,lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4667,"Oops if you forgotten , when customised , didn’t selected from 45W to 65W Lenovo will save some money from your packaged"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4667,Those standard was 45W charger only
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4668,default is the 45W adapter.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4668,"when you upgrade to the 65W, you get the 65W adapter."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4668,"Both of them use 3 pin UK plug, and USB-C on the other end."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4668,"So yes, you get the 65W power adapter."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4669,Ya sia me too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4669,Delayed 2 weeks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4669,"It was by 1 Oct, now it's 14 Oct."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4670,I saw Infinito Atrix shop at Funan carries X395 - Ryzen 3 around $1.2k
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4670,E595 - Ryzen 5 around $1.2k
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4670,That is the only place I saw carrying these models.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4670,Did not see E495/T495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4671,My shipment date was 16 Sep push back to 17 Oct.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4671,Call them
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4671,they say part shortage heatsink and fan.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4671,Thought this is normal parts.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4672,this is the X395?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4672,My T495 thankfully still on 3rd Oct scheduled delivery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4672,Yeah it sounds kinda weird that they could have shortage of a common part.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4673,"Lenovo XX5 models, online channels only"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4674,sounds like bs to me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4675,i saw that as well....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4675,"but the specs quite on the low side, thus the low price for x395"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4676,"Don't get me wrong, the unit sold at that shop the spec is so so."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4676,But that is the only place you can have a feel of the unit itself.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4676,Even next door Lenovo showroom don't have a demo set.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4676,for customer to have a feel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4676,"If anyone want to buy, best would still be through online."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4677,"Ya went there a once, first time to touch and play with X1 Extreme and get and touch on keyboard."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4677,This is great demo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4678,i also went to both stores to see see look look
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4678,I was actually very very very disappointed with the Lenovo flagship store.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4679,and I think most retailers/distributor won't carry/sell.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4679,AMD OEM products in retail shops.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4679,"There is perception about poor performance, heat issues as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4679,as poor popularity thus low sales margin.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4679,"I did ask some shops Not those at Funan, they recommend Intel instead."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4680,sigh.....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4680,my asus netbook PC 1215b with AMD Brazos APU chip is still going strong and iirc

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4727,I advise you guys
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4727,either buy in shop or buy other brands.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4727,Their way of doing business is dubious.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4728,Its like theyre making each laptop individually by hand lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4729,"i think they seriously have a backlog of the popular model, maybe they won't dare to do big promo anymore..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4729,i got 2 e595 slated to deliver early next mth but was delivered last week after updates.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4730,u tried live chat?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4731,Wow!!!

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4733,So your card just got billed today?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4733,"I think that's a good sign, which means they are ready to ship it soon."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4733,I saw threads on another forum that got their X395 orders cancelled by lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4733,Hopefully it won't happen to Singapore buyers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4734,What can do?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4734,Mine is under half half situation now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4734,Either they cancel or send out soon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4734,Already keep more than 3 weeks from 29th Aug.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4750,With regards to the amount being charged..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4750,"Did u have any add-ons like the wireless mouse, carry case etc for $1.00?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4750,Were they charged together with ur thinkpad?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4750,Mine was just the thinkpad charge alone..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4750,Wondering if they will charge another time separately.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4751,The amount excludes the $1 mouse and $1 bag.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4751,So I supposed $2 was billed earlier.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4752,Ok thks for the info..

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4755,if u have seen a glossy black piano b4....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4755,i think it's that kind of finishing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4755,which will attracts 200% more fingerprints and smudges
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4755,lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4755,i prefer the current one like x1c and x280.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4755,or the silver color matt one
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4756,"Rubber paint like X1 Carbon/ Extreme or P1, the surface not as good as normal black color for X395, T480 or T460s."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4756,Due to a bit stick on dust.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4757,tml shud be reaching sg liao

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4759,E is entry so build quality is different than X series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4759,"X is portable since it is 13"" compare with E at 14""."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4759,Depend on your budget and preference whether light weight or.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4759,T series you can consider as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4760,T series would be more expensive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4760,Budget is around $1k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4760,I was thinking if it is cheaper to buy during Black Friday.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4761,"I will also recommend to head down to Funan Thinkpad store and physically try out the E series, X series, T series, W series"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4765,Ideapad - Consumer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4765,Thinkpad - Business
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4765,"Thinkpad will be better than Ideapad, keyboard, mouse and etc."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4766,"okay, thank you."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4766,"Actually after posting the pic, i went to look up and compare Thinkpad E495 vs Ideapad S145 and saw that E495 ius better than S145 in many aspects."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4786,I tried microsim like too big.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4787,Did you select or was the WWAN option selected?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4787,"The specs shows the slot behind is for microsd card too, which means probably its double sided slot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4788,"Oh, extra charge?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4788,I don't think i took that then.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4788,Guess this is a dummy sim card slot

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4791,Where is the option?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4834,lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4835,now chat with the fellas in lelomo site lah...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4835,better
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4836,I digress.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4836,Just upgraded my E585 wifi card to Intel AX200NGW
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4836,& it works pretty well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4836,The default Qualcomm
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4836,QCA9377 is a bit slow as it's 1x1 only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4836,"As some others have mentioned, Lenovo seems to crease their long time policy of whitelisting Wifi cards in their recent laptops Thinkpad line at least."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4836,Intel AX200NGW is a good option for guys using E485/E585 who are stuck with mediocre Qualcomm or Realtek wifi cards.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4836,The card is available on AliExpress:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4836,"For the E495/E595/T495/X395, there is little need to replace the default AC 9260, unless you have a 802.11AX router at home/office."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4837,"This morning,
Just received the invoice from Lenovo for my T495 this morning, ETA should be ard 04th."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4837,"I believe by 02nd Oct Tues, the laptop should be delivered already."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4838,"if im not wrong, x395 wifi card is soldered to the mobo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4838,so even have ax router also cannot change lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4839,Have you teardown and see inside of X395?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4839,X395 is a prefect design all parts device can replacement.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4839,"I had AX200 wifi 6 for my P1 Gen 2, but the speed almost same as X395"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4839,", I don’t think everyone needs it"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4840,nope i wouldn't do that lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4841,"btw, what's that empty slot beside the wifi card ah ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4842,Data WWAN L850-GL card
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4843,"if teardown, warranty void right?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4844,Dunno....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4844,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4845,No sticker sealed no issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4845,Except those sticker sealed on screws
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4846,yup.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4846,your recent buy no sealed sticker?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4847,"Don’t have, never had the warranty sealed sticker on screws hole before."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4848,Where is the rams?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4848,Under the batt?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4848,Or on board?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4850,still in Incheon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4850,"based on other posts, it will go to Shenzen first then to Singapore."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4850,How come the X395 orders only took 2 days ah to reach Singapore?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4850,X1 Extreme Gen 1 is back in stock somehow lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4850,only 1 spec.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4851,What specs u ordered ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4851,How come customised still ship out as fast.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4852,I don't think it's considered fast?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4852,Ordered during the 9.9 sales.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4852,website states 'ships within 2 weeks' right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4852,and it shipped 3 weeks exact from the date of the order.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4852,probably will take another couple of days to reach here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4852,which means 4 weeks total.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4852,the other guys custom spec X395 and
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4852,T495s shipped way faster.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4853,Depend on luck maybe ☹️
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4854,yeah
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4854,I guess so.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4854,maybe I pissed off the customer service.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4854,pic from another guy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4854,it shipped using UPS Worldwide Express Saver which should be way faster.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4854,whereas mine shipped using the UPS Worldwide
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4854,Expedited lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4854,"remember folks, be patient and don't piss off the customer service"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4855,"Hi all, I want to purchase E595 without HDD and only SSD"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4855,but it seems like the customize option is not offering this.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4855,"It doesnt even let me select SSD, when they have E595 pre-configured at 256gb SSD already available for sale."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4855,Anyone knows why this is the case?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4855,"I ask the livechat like 3 times, 2 times they didnt respond and 1 time they said 'checking'"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4855,and i waited until the chat timeout
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4856,There is a option for the E595 laptop with SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4856,but you cannot customize.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4857,Thats exactly what i said.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4857,"I want to customize the other options, hence my question."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4857,Cause it doesnt make sense to me that they have a pre-config one with SSD but dont allow SSD customize?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4857,Thanks anyway!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4858,Probably limited stock
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4858,so they list different options.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4858,Else alternate is get with a dummy hard disk than add SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4859,T495 now 28% off plus shopback 5%
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4860,"If get a dummy hardisk, how they able to preload windows os inside the laptop?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4861,he probably meant get the cheapest HDD and later upgrade them to SSD yourself.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4862,"Finally gotten my cashback succesfully, for those who yet to get cashback just monitor closely as there is no reminder when it get rejected."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4863,"Hi bro, When did u made your purchase?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4864,"no OS if dummy HDD, checked before"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4865,"if 3 days after purchase and cashback still not tracked, should submit missing cashback under ""click activity"""
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4866,"Sorry my bad, get the HDD than clone the image over to SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4867,I'm waiting for x395 promo...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4868,Got one I found it CS
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4869,Not sure if his is just tracked or paid out already.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4869,My NDP period purchase is still under tracking status.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4870,"Mid jun, it got rejected at first and I asked the cso to investigate and drag another month."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4871,"Invoice received on 28th Sep sat, I just received my T495 from UPS."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4871,"Btw, can advise how to check for the screen that I had received, is 400 nits as per what I ordered?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4871,Thnks!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4872,"once paid, status would be ""confirmed""."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4880,So the estimate for the shipment itself fluctuates until you get shipping confirmation from UPS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4880,"I was given an estimate of 27th Sept being shipped, and estimate delivered on 3th Oct initially, then it got pushed back to 30th Sept being shipped and 4th Oct for estimated delivery."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4880,The Laptop warranty also auto-registers when the laptop is shipped.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4880,There's the whole flow to being delivered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4880,"Depending on when you place your order, 'Ships within 2 Weeks' is not accurate."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4880,Mine took 4 weeks to reach.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4884,Maybe a sign that this series will EOL especially the price but uncertain.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4885,will wait for further cut!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4886,Stay tune.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4886,11.11 maybe
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4887,its not a rumor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4887,most likely renoir apu will take over for mobile.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4887,thats why i decided to skip this thinkpad gen as jumping from zen+ to zen2 architecture
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4887,will be very significant for ryzen mobile next year
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4888,I can't put a number on it right now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4888,I try another day
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4888,then I let you know.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4888,"I'm guessing 5 - 6 hours max, perhaps."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4888,"I'm using the 1080p display, should be 300nits as well."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4892,Release date remains unknown but this chip is to challenge Intel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4892,new mobile chips using the new iris graphic IGP.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4894,This is mine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4895,i read abt 3550u
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4895,althought that shld be because of the incoming MS Surface products.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4895,this is probably just a stopgap measure and i dont think Lenovo will issue a minor hardware refresh midway.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4895,the real deal will still be zen 2 mobile next year

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4941,"Even though the DOUBLE10 code has 40% off, it is capped at only $500."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4941,Whereas the 9.9 sale there was no cap.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4969,Supposed to be slightly better color.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4970,Anyone can comment on the battery life for x395?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4970,"Can it last more than 7 hours, with WiFi, running excel office, and play some music?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4971,"Normal used such as your input, more or less around 5-6 hours"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4972,Anyone know if it's ok to leave my laptop charging or should I plug out once fully charged.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4972,Does it make a difference to the longevity of the battery since the battery is non removable?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4973,"Depends on your display brightness, so far 5 -6 hours for me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4974,Can set from vantage battery threshold stop at 100%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4974,Usually I will keep it charged overnight.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4975,you can just leave it plugged.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4976,"Ok, thanks!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4977,the battery threshold at Lenovo Vantage can automatically cutoff charging to the battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4977,I set mine to charge when below 60% and stop at 80% leaving it plugged it and using it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4977,"Based on what I read, it's not good for batteries to be at 100% all the time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4977,And do not use it till really low %.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4977,Optimum for battery is 40-60% range if you want to extend battery life.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4977,"Again, you can do your own readings and choose what to follow."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4977,It's up to you whether you value your battery more or the experience you get from using your laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4978,oh ok.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4978,Thanks for the insight.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4982,"Yes, the minimum does not matter."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4982,Only thing that matters is the max threshold should be about 70% for double lifespan.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4982,Then again take it with a pinch of salt.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,4982,If 70% charge not enough to maintain your daily usage

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5060,Earliest will be Mid 2020.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5060,For now you can consider Thinkpad based on Ryzen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5060,But if you are gaming like playing COD Modern Warefare.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5060,than suggest go for gaming laptop instead.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5060,Online gaming best is to use native LAN port but not dongle.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5060,or WIFI for the X395.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5060,USB LAN Doggle uses USB interface isn't that fast like native.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5060,LAN port due to USB speed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5061,Wah mid 2020?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5061,Then I guess buy now
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5061,"I only play dota 2 with friends, don't play other games"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5061,"Yes, I think native LAN port is sibei important."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5061,I cannot stand lag even if wifi 5ghz.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5061,Any idea which ThinkPad lineup or series that have built in native port?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5061,Does that mean all X series don't have native LAN port?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5061,"As I'm not hardcore gamer, and weight quite important, I don't think worth it to upgrade to gaming laptop unless really no choice"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5084,FYI.. Have checked with Lenovo CSO.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5084,"If you buy from Malaysia, there will only be 1 year international basic warranty, even if you add on to the 3y premium support or 3y on-site support."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5084,Edit:have reconfirmed with another CSO.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5084,"Only for THINK series, the warranty will be extended to Singapore."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5084,So we no need to go back Malaysia for servicing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5085,if 2nd or 3rd yr have issues...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5085,gg
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5086,Have to go back to msia during weekdays.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5086,Righy now Malaysia Lenovo is offering 3y premium support for just RM1.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5086,I think is a good buy and pray it does not give you any problem after the first yr.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5101,"Cause the SG custom will tax for 7%, if this is fully sealed in box."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5101,For example like thinkpad have come with plastic sealed on the laptop itself should not be an issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5102,dun have leh
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5103,There's 2 options:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5103,Integrated Mobile Broadband

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5103,Fibocom L850-GL 4

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5104,Go stay in a reputable hotel in Malaysia and ask them to keep the parcel for you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5104,Still cheaper if go on weekdays.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5105,WWAN and Integrated Mobile Broadband - SIM Card slot
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5105,Any country SIM can be used.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5105,WWAN No Card with Antenna - No SIM Card Slot since WWAN Card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5105,is not installed but antenna is inside meaning
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5105,can add on later.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5105,WWAN Card is only useful for those who intend to use mobile data.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5105,"If the cost is worth it than go for it, else use a dongle or huawei mifi"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5106,Sad thing about T495s is that can only configure up to 24 GB ram?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5107,T495s and X395 maximum up to 16GB ram only
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5108,"So if u choose WWAN no card with antenna, cannot put sim card in the laptop to use?"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5110,Looks like coverage
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5111,Errr.. The SIM card slot is added when the WWAN card is installed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5111,Both are required to work as the WWAN card is the modem card in order for the SIM card to communicate and make connection.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5111,It does not work like HP SIM card slot if that is what you are asking.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5112,Thinkpad series is international warranty.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5115,fn key is on the extreme left of the keyboard and
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5115,the ctrl key is on the right of the fn key.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5115,This setup is different from the usual keyword configuration where ctrl is on the right and fn is on the left

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5184,It seems that the Lenovo stock driver isn't optimise for the AMD chip and need to download the AMD driver to install manually...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5185,Is there a checklist or guide of things to do when receive ThinkPad for new users?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5185,"For example, Update Bios, drivers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5185,Install Lenovo vintage?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5185,Windows update
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5185,Any bloatware to remove or settings to turn off always on USB?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5185,Anything else?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5186,Dunno.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5186,Maybe some experts can do that?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5186,I did install the latest AMD kit chipset drivers etc from Lenovo
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5186,but it seems to be buggy which kills off performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5186,I hardly see my core 0 and 1 to move above 1.5Ghz during load with min cpu state at 90-100%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5186,I have no idea
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5186,it was stuck and that resulted only 3000 pts for PCMark 10.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5186,The laptop felt so slow like an 5 yrs old laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5186,"After several tries and errors, I decided to download the latest AMD chipset drivers from AMD this time instead of Lenovo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5186,"Using AMD uProf, I can see that all my cores are active and can hit 3.5Ghz or close to 3.7Ghz and occassionally hitting 25-28W and stable around 20-22W during load."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5186,My PCMark 10 result jumps to 3700 pts.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5186,It does not really matter which power profile
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5186,I use Lenovo Intelligent or AMD Ryzen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5186,Balanced.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5186,The latest AMD chipset drivers from Lenovo for T495s is buggy...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5186,don't use it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5187,Just finish setting up my x395 ytd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5187,Spent quite some time to configure nicely.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5187,"I just used Lenovo vantage to update everything, including bios, Radeon graphic, windows updates, etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5187,I encountered the radeon setting and version not compatible.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5187,So need to go into registry to make some changes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5188,Anyone has issues with your T495s reading microSD card?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5188,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5189,I did put in the card then boot up but didn't detect the card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5189,Remove and reinsert then able to detect.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5189,Maybe the first time I didn't insert properly?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5190,Same cos windows will auto update the driver and end up
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5190,it is not tally.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5190,I installed the latest adrenaline raedon driver from AMD which is newer n better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5190,Did a benchmark run?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5190,See if it matches or close to those benchmark results...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5190,I did that and realise the Lenovo AMD driver isn't working well and my core 0 and 1 got stuck at 1.5ghz even at load.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5190,Manage to resolve it by installing the latest AMD chipset drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5191,hmm the story is dont update from vantage or windows update?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5191,direct download from AMD website?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5191,what's the correct sequence to update?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5191,AMD->vantage->windows update?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5192,Will windows or vantage update overwrite it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5193,Overwrite which one?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5193,The AMD driver from AMD website is the newer version
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5193,so windows n vantage will not overwrite it unless it has a higher version.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5194,I will try again.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5194,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5195,"hi, this is my graphic driver version for my x395:"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5195,26.20.11028.6003
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5195,Is this the latest one?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5195,"Tried using bluestacks, unfortunately the game is too laggy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5195,Not sure whether it's becos of the graphic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5195,"Found some more drivers over here, not sure is this compatible with my laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5196,Ya this is the latest AMD graphics drivers for Ryzen Radeon Vega.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5196,U might want to download and install the AMD chipset driver too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5196,https://www.amd.com/en/support/chipsets/socket-fp5-mobile/amd-ryzen-and-athlon-mobile-chipset
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5197,Thanks alot!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5198,"Wanted to give the Lenovo AMD kit a chance, I went to read up the Lenovo AMD kit and see what are the driver version..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5198,Uninstall the latest AMD driver and install back the Lenovo drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5198,After I verify the driver version to ensure it was installed properly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5198,Got to uninstall the graphics card and install Lenovo ones
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5198,cos
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5198,if not Windows will install back its own Vegra version.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5198,"Run the pcmark10 again, and this time the results is within expectation ard 3650"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5198,+.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5198,The fastest I got with using AMD driver from AMD website
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5198,and I got around 3740
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5198,+.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5198,Latest AMD still faster.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5198,"I suspect when I reinstall the windows, the drivers are not loaded properly probably so of the drivers are installed automatically by windows with the wrong version that resulted in only 3000+ pcmark10 score."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5199,hmm
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5199,"so if install latest AMD, windows will uninstall and install its version?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5199,"For users who receive new laptop, first step is"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5199,1 download lenovo vantage and install lenovo drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5199,2 windows update.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5199,3 install latest amd drivers?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5199,Thanks for sharing this...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5199,my laptop arriving soon
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5199,edit: this pcmark 10 need to pay to use?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5199,can't find free version...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5200,first step is.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5200,enjoy your new laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5200,why need to do so many things
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5200,lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5200,just let it run automatically lah
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5201,Not sure cos maybe I have a few version of drivers...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5201,My set comes with Vantage installed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5201,"Anyway, just go and check if you are running the latest Lenovo drivers such as AMD Kit"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5201,will do.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5201,Look at the readme from the Lenovo website to see the version and compared to your installed driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5201,"For the AMD drivers from the AMD site, u can ignore unless u wanna try the difference."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5201,Pcmark10 needs to install steam to download and launch.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5201,There is a free demo version which is good enough.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5202,"haha, need to setup and configure for best experience mah"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5202,hmm
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5202,"okay, the problem with installing the latest AMD drivers from AMD is that windows will uninstall and install its own version?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5202,"i see, then i will just follow ur advice and install lenovo drivers then win update"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5204,it is much better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5205,"Is this possible if I, first do a bootable thumb drive?"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5210,"So if you upgrade SSD on your own, u usually choose the traditonal HDD and then do u separately buy a SATA ssd or NVME m.2?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5210,Assuming T495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5211,"But if you upgrade yourself it will void warranty, right?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5212,"Lenovo allow u upgrade like ram, wifi card or Ssd, but make sure do not touch the rest."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5212,"If they won’t allow you upgrade mean the screw have warranty sealed sticker,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5212,"If anythng wanna claim , the original ssd try to keep with original software."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5227,Does it actually come without camera?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5227,anyone bought this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5227,also the touch pad is different from the configurable one....

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5235,Cheap to compare from IdeaPad?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5236,they are now including a tablet for $0.10 wor
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5237,"Price close to L340 lenovo.sg that comes with better cpu 3500u, 15.6"" but no ips screen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5238,How about Lenovo ThinkBook 15?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5238,Gen is about 1.6K.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5238,How does Think Book compare with Thinkpad?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5239,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/lenovo-thinkbook-13s-vs-lenovo-thinkpd-x390/
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5239,Lenovo’s iconic ThinkPad has been its go-to laptop line for business users for years.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5239,But the company decided the ThinkPad might be too much for small business people who might want something that’s not quite so business-like.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5239,"Therefore, it created the ThinkBook line, which melds consumer and business features for someone who’s looking for a mix of both."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5239,If you are really not sure which one to get....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5239,Then I strongly suggest you to head down to a physical LENOVO authorized dealer which offers a wide range of Lenovo laptop for you to try them out physically.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5239,"To me, typing experience is one of my top priorities."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5239,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5240,"i dun think the keyboard , typing experience will be the same as thinkpad."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5241,"ThinkPad more on carbon , plastic and poly material, design for drop and durable chassis."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5241,"Downside is bulky and dirty with fingerprints, also thin bezel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5241,"IdeaPad metal body, better feel , bezel less, anti fingerprints and easy to maintain."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5241,The good thing is less bored.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5242,I bought E595 yesterday..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5242,"the customer rep said if i install a RAM myself, it will void warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5242,Not sure if he really knows whether RAM slot is sealed or not.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5242,"Anyone bought this already configurable model, can confirm whether RAM slot is sealed?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5243,CSO bullsh***ing
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5243,you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5243,Warranty only void if you damage parts due to actions like using a crowbar to remove the RAM.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5244,oh is it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5244,because of CSO i ordered 8 GB just to be safe in case the slot is sealed.. could easily buy 16 GB on amazon for that same price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5245,"Why not
?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5246,Try to buy 16 x 2 very cheap from Amazon now
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5247,For me personally the typing experience is important since I need to do a lot of typing...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5247,"after I tried both the Thinkpad and thinkbook, I went with Thinkpad"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5247,Personally I feel that the typing experience on thinkbook is similar to ideapad

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5248,"For my own experience, X1 Carbon 5th, 6th Gen, Yoga S730 and C940 is the best, not too hard or too soft like a Thinkbook 13s."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5248,X1 Extreme/P1 Gen 2 slightly harder.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5248,T495 and X395 very close to X1 Carbon level.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5248,Anyway Yoga or Ideapad keyboard not that bad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5248,So far the worst keyboard was the Thinkbook 13s.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5249,X1 carbon Gen 7 was out of budget lolx

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5256,I have a similar case as well for a few years back for a Lenovo Laptop.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5256,"One year later, the SSD got a problem."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5256,I called the Customer Support Technician to come to the office.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5256,The Technician saw that SSD is third party.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5256,He/
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5256,She said can void the warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5256,So we explain the story to the Technician with the receipt and the offer taken in picture Saved by the account dept.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5256,He/
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5256,She said it company policies
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5256,but we taken it well after some explainations.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5256,They reserve the right to void the warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5256,I think they do not want to promise anyone that any RAM can slot in.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5256,Better to be safe than sorry.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5256,I got the E495 in July
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5256,but I yet to open it yet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5257,That's pretty unlucky...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5257,SSD for issue after just one year

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5260,Thought about it
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5260,but the problem I'm having now is
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5260,i don't know the correct configuration voltage
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5260,etc yet because my laptop is still not delivered to me...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5260,Any suggestion?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5260,Can i just get something that says DDR4 2400 mhz SoDIMM and expect it to work on E595...?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5261,"Yes the invoice was kept, it only reflected SSD upgrade with no brand indicated."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5261,So the tech guy cannot determine the upgrade is legitimate.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5261,So yeap.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5261,The aftermath was the tech guy ask me to go directly to the SSD maker and make a complaint and reinstall the OS on my own.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5262,At the end of the day....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5262,The tech from Lenovo still refuses to honour the warranty

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5268,Think it's more of a case that the part that failed does not correlate to the original one.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5277,Guys if you purchased the yoga series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5277,Please try to fill-in here
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5278,Can anyone help pls?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5279,Hi 👋  bumdssa.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5279,1.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5279,if i were to select dummy hard disk drive for my first hard drive and select a 256gb SSD for my second hard drive... there will be no OS?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5279,or will OS be installed in the SSD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5279,Yes will change to SSD for main drive with windows 10.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5279,2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5279,"i see that there is a per-configured model with AMD Radeon Vega8 Graphics whereas for the build your own, it says Integrated Graphics."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5279,they are essential the same thing?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5279,"Vega8 on 3500U , Vega10 with 3700U only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5279,3.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5279,"for the per-configured model, it says camera not available."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5279,means no webcam?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5279,"cos for build your own, seems like it is a default."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5279,"Not available for pre-model have to check with SA, usually try to customised by your own to be save place."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5280,Thank you sir!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5280,Was confused when I read some post that if select dummy drive for 1st hard drive and SSD as second hard drive then there will be no OS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5280,Haha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5280,Both slots are 2.5inch sata slots right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5280,Say if I select only SSD and would want to install another SSD on my own...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5280,Am I able to do that?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5281,Ssd was nvme 2242 or 2280.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5281,HDD was 2.5”
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5281,Either one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5282,Can I pop in my old HDD and ram without voiding the warranty?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5282,Asking for Lenovo l340 model.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5283,Hard disk can be swap between models.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5283,However OS have to be reinstalled especially L340
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5283,is Intel
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5283,so OS won't.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5283,Start on AMD laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5283,Do backup your data before the swap than reinstall the OS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5284,I got old 2.5 sata from another laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5284,I want the data on it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5284,I will buy a new laptop set with 128 gig ssd
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5284,pre installed
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5284,I want to insert this old 2.5 sata into the the new computer
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5284,Will I void the warranty on the new computer?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5284,"If I insert ram from my old laptop into the new one, will it void the warranty too ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5285,Generally if you upgrade/migrate parts from another laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5285,Warranty won't be void.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5285,"However:
- RAM must be of same spec and supported by the laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5285,"=- HDD wise you can migrate over but take the data you have
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                to either retrieve it first."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5286,I have some technical questions.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5286,I noticed some people prefer to do a clean install of Windows 10 to remove bloatware and vendor-installed programs when they get their brand new laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5286,I am thinking through about the process.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5286,"After you clean install, how do you handle the licensing portion or the activation portion?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5287,If yours is a Skylake CPU
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5287,"ie 6th gen or newer, Windows should automatically activate  on its own."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5287,"If you want to play it safe, get the existing product key using tools such as Showkeyplus or Produkey before installing Windows."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5288,Thanks Ark.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5288,I download Showkeyplus and was able to obtain by installed key.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5288,"For non-Intel like Lenovo Ryzen CPU in this case, will they automatically activate also?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5289,anyway to add eGPU to X395 ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5290,eGPU?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5290,What is that???
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5290,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5291,Nope.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5291,Mobile Ryzen chip doesn't support thunderbolt nor usb 4
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5292,External GPU
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5293,I did a clean installation in my t495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5293,For my case windows will just detect the key automatically
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5294,Yes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5294,"As long as a CPU doesn't support Win7, it should automatically activate the license when fresh installing Win10"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5295,How to add?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5295,😱
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5295,😱
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5295,😱
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5296,my intel x1's dock got thunderbolt port.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5296,then able to use.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5297,I thought Lenovo has their own external GPU???
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5297,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5298,Only works via thunderbolt
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5299,"Cheaper model comes with thunderbolt 3 was the Yoga Series S730, S740 or S940 and C940 else"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5300,egpu can be used via wifi card port
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5301,Don’t forget if the laptop itself without thunderbolt port
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5301,there’s no function at all.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5302,my friend also say most need thunderbolt...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5302,otherwise we will need to DIY using PCI-E?!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5303,PCIe card for desktop only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5303,But laptop don’t have any option to upgrade or add on media card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5304,Not entirely impossible
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5304,but I haven't seen anyone try.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5304,Our laptops typically have a mini PCIe slot for WWAN card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5304,"Some ppl will use it to install a PCIe NVME 2242 SSD, but I haven't seen anyone daring enough to try to extend this port for eGPU purposes."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5304,"To do so, you'll probably have to modify the laptop chassis significantly to allow for the additional cabling"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5305,Can find here from YouTube
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5306,"eGPU from Razer Core X , just plug in for any thunderbolt 3 port will work."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5307,"Hi, @bumdssa"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5307,"Warranty wise, you may remove in future if anything go wrong, otherwise your data will be expose to someone."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5307,Once you had remove your SSD 2.5 sata they won't void your warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5307,"If selected to dummy HDD, I saw some user might need to buy Sata cable just few bucks from AliExpress or Lazada"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5308,Where got the 15 inch e series to try?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5308,"Molested the 14 inch series and really like it, but want to see the 15 inch one also since price about same same now"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5309,"Funan Infinito Atrix, FYI try there only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5309,Get from online would be better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5310,"for those that deliver to malaysia address, are you able to specific the data and timing of the delivery?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5311,"Delivery cannot selected, anyway same as Singapore, base on estimate date."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5312,"thanks bro, sorry didnt realise that my inbox was full."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5313,Which model?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5314,anyone ran bluestacks or other android emulator on x395 before?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5314,I tried mine
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5314,it's way too lag to run any games.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5315,Does anyone have issue with scaling size?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5315,I realised the default is 150% scaling factor for my thinkpad
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5315,t495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5315,"However, when I open some app, the app is too large to see"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5315,"When I scale it down to 149%, I can see the app/window but my mouse cursor and"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5315,everything else become smaller
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5315,is there a good fix to this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5316,1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5316,Memory --> Is 8GB 4+4 sufficient ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5316,Or do I need 12GB 4+8 ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5316,2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5316,First Hard Drive --
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5316,>
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5316,"I have selected 500GB
3."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5316,Second Hard Drive --> Which one will be better ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5316,"Also, the OS will be installed on which hard drive if I choose both 1st and 2nd hard drive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5316,Thank you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5317,1. 8 + 8 more sufficient.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5317,2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5317,"First HDD very slow, good to remain this."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5317,Anyway can upgrade after you get the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5317,3
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5317,SSD can left this empty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5317,"IF you have extra nvme 256gb , can use as main drive to booting up windows to save your awaiting time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5317,I mean do upgrade in future.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,Seeking some help here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,"Previously, I mentioned in this thread that I experience BSOD from time to time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,"It has gotten more frequent, so I contacted Lenovo, and they asked me to do testings, which all passed, and troubleshoot, which did not resolve the issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,The final step they told me is to reset my windows.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,"As I was backing up whatever I need, I experienced BSOD 5 times in an hour."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,"The resetting of windows failed too, so I had to go down to the service centre to borrow a copy of the windows to reinstall."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,"Feeling that there is something wrong, I sent in my laptop and gotten it back yesterday, with the SSD replaced."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,Zzz.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,Dunno how the tests I was supposed to run didnt picked that up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,"Anyway, thats not I am seeking help here for."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,My Seagate external hard-disk cannot be seen from Windows Explorer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,Even the Seagate Toolkit cannot open the drive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,"But under device manager, the external hard-disk is there"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,and it is supposed to be working properly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,"I tried updating drivers, but it says it already has the latest drivers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,"I tried plugging that external hard-disk to my MacBook to see if the hard disk Ian really dead, but it can be detected and I managed to extract everything out into my MacBook."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5318,Anyone knows whats wrong with the windows on the T585?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5319,"Wonder check with you, do you formatted and do fresh windows installation?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5320,"In my side, I chose the reset option as I dont have a physical copy of the windows."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5320,Failed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5320,"After the service centre replaced my SSD, not sure what they did."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5320,I would assume its a fresh install.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5321,"As per your specs , this is come with both drives?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5321,Hdd for main and secondary was the ssd?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5321,Actually service Center can be exchange from Ssd for main drive and HDD for backup drive D.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5321,Anyway hopefully it’s working fine
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5322,Only 1 drive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5322,SSD for main.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5322,No secondary drive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5322,I use external hard-drive for backup.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5323,"usually after u place order, it takes 2-3 weeks to ship out?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5323,"When they ship out, that's when they charge to the credit card"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5323,right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5324,Lenovo charge u after receive the UPS tracking number.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5325,ok can.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5325,I managed to get CSO to waive off the 3 years warranty $72.50.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5325,I heard some bros here did the same
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5325,but they didn't waive it off.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5325,Hopefully mine waived off.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5325,The 5% shopback is also a significant saving.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5326,which model did you buy?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5326,you asked for waiver after ordering?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5327,Wanted to get T495 but no discount
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5327,so i decided to get E495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5327,i ask before ordering.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5328,"Using E485, anyone encountered random beep on their speakers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5328,"No sequence , beep at the max volume of the speakers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5328,"Updated audio, video and lan drivers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5328,TIA.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5329,any one know is there any Ryzen laptop with thunderbolt port?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5330,Thunderbolt is Intel with Apple project.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5330,I don’t think AMD wanna pay license to Intel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5331,Intel is licensing TB3 royalty free for inclusion into USB4.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5331,We'll see laptops with AMD chips and TB3-enabled USB4 ports coming in 2020/21.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5331,Source:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5332,TB3 is good to help those needed egpu for gaming.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5332,But make sure the laptop can able to upgrade from minimum Ram 8gb to 32gb Ram at least.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5332,Otherwise hang on half way or can’t shut down after exit from eGPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5333,Fyi.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5333,My T495 Ethernet port seems looser than most other Ethernet ports on other devices.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5333,"Doesn't seem to affect the contact with Ethernet cable but still, I am not too happy about it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5334,Okay thanks for sharing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5335,can't wait to see the new amd models!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5336,Anyone have any recommendations for a GaN charger?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5336,"Something cheap and reliable, preferably with SG plug"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5337,"Hi, can anybody direct me to the latest AMD driver software version and suitable AMD catalyst centre for x395?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5337,"My Radeon Software Version is: 19.10.28.08, driver version is:"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5337,26.20.11028.8001
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5337,Thanks in advance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5338,Usually graphic driver for laptop best to use manufacturer than AMD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5338,"On Lenovo support site, the driver you are using is the latest for X395."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5338,by Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5338,Unless you are having issues than update to drivers from AMD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5339,Thank you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5339,How about AMD catalyst?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5339,Strangely the laptop does not come with pre-installed catalyst.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5339,My desktop does thou.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5339,Is x395 compatible with this program?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5339,"My laptop is lagging when running Android emulator, so I'm find ways to enhance the performance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5340,Probably the driver is automatic updated by Windows 10 that is why the catalyst control centre isn't installed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5340,You can try: - Download the driver from Lenovo website.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5340,- Disconnect the laptop from Internet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5340,*
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5340,This is to prevent Windows 10 for installing missing drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5340,- Download and run AMD Uninstall Ultity from AMD website. -
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5340,Install the Driver from Lenovo
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5340,=- install the additional radeon Application profile
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5340,Hope this helps.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5341,Thanks a lot!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5342,"looking to get the E495 for purely work excel etc, currently using a mac."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5342,"Currently there's not much additional discount apart from the regular on-going ""sale""."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5342,"Is it an okay price, ThinkPad E495 - 20NE001FSG @ SGD$767?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5342,"Will there be any upcoming promotions / and if so, will it differ much?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5342,Cheers
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5343,"I was waiting since Oct. 11.11, 12.12, black friday, christmas."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5343,No promo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5343,Lowest is 21% ish.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5343,So i suggest you probably wait for at most CNY promo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5343,"Then if cannot get good deals, you just purchase it after CNY."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5344,how much was the price after the 21%?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5345,Well it depends on what you add right?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5346,I am trying to get a Thinkpad T495s and need the extended warranty to make sure it will last the entire 3 year uni.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5346,Can share how to get the CSO to waive off the 3 years warranty?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5347,Just chat and ask them.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5347,"If fail, try again another time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5348,Now waiting for cny deal.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5351,"For those who can wait, should wait for zen 2!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5351,Otherwise current amd offering quite competitive with intel gen 8
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5352,"regarding the rams, do i need to go into bios to enable xmp or similar to set the ram speed?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5353,They cant waive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5353,At most discount to $1.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5353,Must see if the CSO is eager for incentive or not.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5354,yup $1 for 3 years warranty almost like waive off.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5355,Trying to factory reset a T495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5355,but I can't find any Lenovo recovery program.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5355,"Is there such a program installed in the first place, or I simply use the Reset function in Windows 10?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5355,"If it the latter method, will it install the Vantage after reset or require re-download?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5356,"Unless you are savvy enough, you can try clean install."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5356,Preferably load the drivers from Lenovo after the install.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5357,Thanks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5357,Probably I will just do a reset with Windows 10 and download the Vantage and Radeon applications separately from Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5358,"i followed this link -
- to create a USB recovery disk for my T480"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,Just want to share my lenovo svc support experience for those interested.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,"My E585 was overheating under load and sometimes BSOD, so i used online chat to contact support."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,"I was 1st in queue and discussed with the rep, showing her screenshot of 70C temp alongside only 20% cpu usage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,She said engineer will be sent and I received sms confirmation about an hour later.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,Appointment date was next day.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,Engineer called before arriving.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,He was very friendly and gave frank advice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,"He said AMD will run hotter than intel, so may want to consider laptop fan pad if I'll be using laptop for 8+ hours a day."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,"After warranty, I can also consider replacing the thermal grease on my own."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,"He checked then replaced the heatsink fan assembly easy, 4 screws and a plug, and said to call him directly if problem returns."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,The entire flawless support process took less than 24 hours.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,I'm so glad I got
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,their on-site 3-yr support.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,Background of my overheating problem:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,"My 1 yr old e585 was reaching 85C while just performing backup or installing large software, sometimes resulting in BSOD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,"disks temp were just 44C, 54C"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,A
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,previous large windows update BSOD midway and corrupted my windows.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,This never happened before.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,Took me a while to come to conclusion
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,it was heat related.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,I ran lenovo's windows diagnostics software but fan test passed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,Fortunately I found the problem after I monitored using HWMonitor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,the engineer mentioned lenovo has a temperature software for download too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,"After the replacement, I ran backup and max temp immediately reduced to 75C."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5359,"The old fan looked very clean and perfect, so it should be that the thermal grease lost effectiveness over time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5360,can share what is the lenovo temperature sw ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5361,thanks for sharing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5361,will monitor the heat for these ryzen chip.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5362,Tried looking couldn't find it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5362,"He may be referring to Lenovo Diagnostics Windows, under Tools tab"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5362,there is a Fan Device showing current cpu temp and fan speed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5362,Btw also want to mention I like their diag software.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5362,"Very comprehensive can check mobo, pcie, lid sensor, wifi, etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5363,no prob.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5363,he also mentioned overheating can damage mobo
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5363,so need to be wary indeed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5363,"ryzen does outperform intel chips though, so some consolation there"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5363,i guess.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5364,"I have used several gen of AMD laptop, temp have not reach that high before."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5364,"AMD Turion, Phenom II and A series, highest I recall was about 70."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5364,Average was about 50 or so.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5364,"Maybe you have to do maintenance like:
- Update BIOS If you haven't
-"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5364,Fresh install OS/Reset OS
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5364,Especially if your OS was updated from 1809 to 1903.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5364,Best to do a fresh install.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5364,=- try installing the graphic driver from Lenovo than AMD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5364,Lenovo version maybe older but
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5364,the chip will run at
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5364,it's optimal.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5364,setting like clock speed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5364,=- Update amd Chipset driver
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5365,Thanks for the link.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5365,I wasnt able to select most of my USB disk as recovery during the process.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5365,Not sure the reason despite all my USB drives satisfy the requirements.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5365,Windows 10 is able to detect all of them.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5365,Manage to create the recovery when I tried the last one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5366,You can try use Command prompt diskpart to partition the.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5366,USB disk suitable to create recovery media.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5367,"Yes my first instinct was check the software, so updated via vantage and windows updates."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5367,But didnt solve anything.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5367,I'm also using lenovo's graphics driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5368,what's the size of your drives?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5368,"I vaguely remember i was only successful after i pop in a 16GB/32GB stick, not sure which one i popped in."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5368,Was concurrently doing another recovery drive for my HP Envy
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5369,I'm using 32GB drive but it fails.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5369,Resort to using a MicroSD card inserted into the USB card reader and the creation cam proceed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5370,Does your thumb drive have other files?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5370,Usually I use a freshly formatted flash drive
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5370,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5371,I think it's more likely to be poor thermal paste application from the factory or sub-optimal heatsink contact.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5371,"That said, my E585 ranges from 42C to 88C during normal usage at room temp of about 29C."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5371,It's possible that the newer BIOS have changes to the CPU throttling behaviour
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5371,", cos I don't remember seeing temperatures of more than 82C a few BIOS versions back."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5371,I have ran Intel i7 8650u on Thinkpad x280 beyond 90C under full load
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5371,there is a limit to how well a slim chassis can cool.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5371,The notebook design & thermal/power limits set by the OEM in the bios make the biggest difference.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5371,"It's not true that AMD mobile CPUs run hotter than equivalent Intel CPUs, at least for CPUs fabbed under 12nm/14nm process & set to run at similar power limits eg: 25W."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5371,Just use CPU Coretemp.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5372,"Hi all,
I am using a T495."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5372,"My laptop has been lagging very badly  eg open chrome, open jpg file it spins for quite a while, even scrolling down a web page it lags."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5372,I even have problem shutting down.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5372,Could it be due to the windows upgrade to V1909 2?thnks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5373,Do a clean install if you know how to.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5374,It was formatted several times right before I start the process of creating the recovery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5374,"Yesterday, I bought another thumbdrive, same brand USB 3 and capacity, and it works out of the box."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5374,Just curious about the reason it fails to work on the older thumbdrive despite Windows 10 detects and read/write flawlessly with it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5375,glad to hear that it's working for you now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5375,Mind sharing which brand/model thumbdrive giving you the issue?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5376,Now bad time to buy customized laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5376,Likely to take over 1 month rather than 2 weeks as shown on website from payment to shipping.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5377,Sandisk Extreme USB3 32GB has the issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5377,But I dont really think it is faulty since Windows 10 is able to detect
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5377,and I can continue to read/write files to it during my testing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5377,Probably it is due to disk partition as someone has pointed out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5377,Bought 2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5377,Sandisk Ultra 32GB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5377,with no issue out of the box.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5378,Read someone purchase got delayed previously.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5378,"Bought mine before the CNY and fortunately, I received it 2 weeks later."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5378,"If not for the CNY holidays, I aight receive it earlier."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5379,I had the issue with Extreme pro when creating recovery media/tools.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5379,Thus I usually use Ultra to do it than.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5379,Extreme pro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5380,ordered mine almost 2 weeks ago..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5380,no updates yet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5381,Currently lenovo factory closed until 9 Feb by order of PRC.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5381,If China government announce another week closure..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5381,The Live Chat CSO is pissed off by now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5382,their live chat wasn't online yesterday.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5382,any idea where they ship from?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5382,Shenzhen?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5383,My order back in June 2019 was picked up in Shanghai.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5383,They have many factory in China.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5384,"Dear Customer,
Due to the recent coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese Government has imposed regulations restricting the movement of personnel across many regions in China."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5384,This has impacted our factory operations and delivery schedule.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5384,Our factories will be partially operational during the middle of February before returning to normal operations by end of February.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5384,"Therefore, your orders may be delayed for an additional 2-3 weeks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5384,We are in constant communication with our factories on delivery schedule.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5384,"If you would like to know more about ready-to-ship options that are available in our warehouse, please contact our sales and online chat team at 800-601-1481 option #1."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5384,"Should you have further questions, please feel free to reach out to us."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5384,We are sorry for any inconvenience this delay may have caused.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5385,Hi selling my rarely use mint condition x395 max specs
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5386,Lenovo factory will start full production only from 24 Feb.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5387,Whether they can start successfully or not...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5387,That is another question.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5387,What I heard is that China factories need to submit a request to resume work to the local Province authority.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5387,The province authority will need to check if the factory is able to reduce n prevent local transmission of coronavirus to the lowest possibility.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5387,Check whether have mask.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5387,"Check this, check that."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5387,If don't have...

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5388,I am using the E485 for about a year now
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5388,and so far the temps are within expectation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5388,"Due to the size of the heatsink, it is normal for the temps to hit north of 80 degs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5388,"I've even changed the thermal compound to Thermal Grizzly, and at load, it will still hit the low 80 degs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5388,"While the E585 has a bigger chassis, the cooler and heatsink unfortunately is still small and the bottleneck."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5388,"I can't confirm what is the temp threshold before it throttles the CPU frequency, but I believe it should be something like 82 to 85 degs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5388,Glad they resolved your issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5389,"There are a few stops in China, and I recall Shenzhen being one of the stops."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5393,is there any Ryzen offers now?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5394,When you ordered?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5394,Was there any estimated to ship before shipping or
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5394,just all of sudden shipped?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5395,All laptop on offers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5396,Can I check if T495 WiFi card can upgrade to Intel AX?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5397,This is just.....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5397,I have raised cancellation request.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5397,"Due to the various bad feedback on the lenovo forums about order cancellation, I have done one step further by cancelling the credit card I used for the laptop order to prevent it from being charged."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5398,"E595 works with Intel AX, so T495 will probably work, but don't take my word for it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5398,Can't find the whitelist for T495.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5400,Waiting for offer
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5401,I am not sure if cancelling your card will help.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5401,"Normally once you placed an order, the seller will send a request to your card company to ""lock in"" the amount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5401,The idea is really to prevent people from cancelling their card when they want to collect payment.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5401,"You can determine if this is the case by checking your card limit vs the actual amount you spent the difference is likely the ""locked in"" amount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5401,"While the card is cancelled, if Lenovo decides to take payment, the amount will still be charged to you."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5402,The amount has already been refunded back to my account 1 week after the order.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5402,I used a debit card.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5408,also it works well with any type C laptops.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5408,and cheaper than the thinkpad ultradock which costs 474

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5409,"Order shipped out 14 Jan, arrived 18 Jan."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5409,Also managed to get further discount due to shipping delay
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5410,Huh?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5410,CNY is 25 to 27 Jan leh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5410,"I ordered on 24th Jan, nearly one month already still haven't start manufacturing."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5413,Only 1199 at challenger and has TB3.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5413,Only 8gb ram and 512gb though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5413,But laptop resale value in Singapore is crap anyway

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5421,The new Thinkpad ETA is Q2 2020.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5422,yeah
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5422,the fact that the XPS 13 only has 2 USB-C ports and almost nothing else is the part that got me thinking...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5422,But I'm wondering how much better the Ryzen 4k series will be Vs ice lake.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5422,My Dell will only ship out in mid March so not too long a wait.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5429,Not in a rush actually
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5429,In fact I too am interested to see the performance level.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5437,They rather you pay them to upgrade for you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5438,"Looks like there's a further drop of ~S$50 on the current AMD line-up, likely in preparation for the upcoming model refresh."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5438,At least the base X395 has dropped from S$989 yesterday to S$936 today.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5440,They probably clearing stocks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5440,I ordered my custom
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5440,e495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5440,last week
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5440,and it came yesterday.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5440,Faster than expected
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5441,I think wait for renoir
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5442,"Since Renoir is new, it will result in higher prices."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5442,Current Ryzen chips are decently fast and couple with a good price is not a bad deal.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5443,Do you still have this issue and how did you resolve it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5443,having same problems
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5444,"Guys the e495, secondary drive choose ssd PCI or nvme?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5444,Also if choose the ssd
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5444,the OS
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5444,I assume they will install on the ssd and not on the hdd correct?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5444,lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5444,Also worth upgrading 3200 to 3500?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5444,Any real world benefit?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5444,Not gaming
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5445,Just to check.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5445,Besides lenovo sg online anywhere else can i go down to buy?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5445,"If only able to purchase from online, how long is the waiting time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5445,Anyone bought from online lenovo store b4?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5446,last year I bought an IdeaPad for my in-laws and it took almost two weeks IIRC.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5446,Now due to COVID might be longer unless you buy ready to ship models?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5447,there is a flagship shop at Funan.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5447,"But if you want to customize your laptop, then it is better to order it directly from lenovo singapore website."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5448,Choose NVME.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5448,They will install OS on the SSD if it is present.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5448,"Also, I would recommend going for the Ryzen 5 3500U."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5448,The extra cores are well worth the upgrade considering that there is no way you can upgrade later.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5448,But really depends on what you will use the computer for.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5449,"I feel the parts are available, just whether the factories have started work in China."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5449,"I believe so, though not at 100% capacity."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5449,"So I agree there may be a delay, but should not be that bad."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5449,Otherwise there is no reason for them to start a big sale on 3:3 which they can barely fulfill.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5450,I see otherwise.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5450,They will launch the sale due to no computer show in March 2020.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5450,Whether they can fulfill is up to China side.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5450,"If can not fulfill, blame it on China."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5450,At least I told my boss I did my part while 20-30% of the sales may be dropped by customers
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5450,", I still have that 70% for my bonus."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5462,I plan to not upgrade ram $170 for 16gb is too steep when I can get 2x8Gb from simlim for $115 and upgrade it myself and keep the spare 4gb somewhere

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5464,"Working indoors, so screen should not be an issues."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5464,No heavy macros or whatsoever
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5465,"Lenovo so called ""NVME"" SSD are actually M2 SATA I think."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5465,"I got very slow read write speed, not that of NVME."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5465,Changed to real ADATA NVME and got triple speed of the lenovo hynix SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5465,Lenovo SSD - 500MB read 200MB write
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5465,ADATA SSD - 1800MB read 900MB write.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5465,Hynix is made in korea
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5465,so...... can't be poor NAND memory right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5466,Maybe MX230?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5467,Closest will likely be MX130.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5467,But do note that integrated graphics like the Vega 8 here is going to be slower since it shares resources with the CPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5467,The 15W TDP is going to be a dampener to performance as well when both the CPU and GPU are under load.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5468,Are you comparing with similar size SSD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5468,"The last time I took out the NVME SSD from my E485, it was from Toshiba and it doesn't come with any DDR cache onboard."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5468,"Without onboard RAM on the SSD, it will adversely impact performance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5468,"It was running faster than the SATA3 specs, so will have to be an NVME drive at least for my case."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5468,Actually don't have to speculate if its NVME or not.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5468,"Some apps will tell you what SSD is being used when you run them, i.e. Speccy, and"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5468,even the more conventional HWMonitor should give you an idea/ model number.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5469,"My take is to up the RAM size to a single 8GB, and you can get another 8GB from Sim Lim."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5469,"While you can run 4GB + 16GB in dual channel, I am not sure if it is ideal since 1 channel has 4x more ram than the other."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5469,"In addition, you should upgrade the 45W charger to a 65W version."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5469,I recall the upgrade was 2 bucks or less.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5469,"While 45W is sufficient in most cases, it is good to have some extra legroom for faster charging, and it should be less taxing on the power brick when the laptop is under load."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5470,"Well, lets say I regretted upgrading from the default 128gb to 256gb from Lenovo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5470,Yes it is in comparsion with same size 256GB SSD from Adata SX8200 Pro which I changed to this year
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5470,I got the laptop last year in June.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5471,I think it is more cost effective to get the default 4gb and upgrade to a kit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5471,Amazon and Newegg sell cheaper.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5471,I maxed out to 32gb at only S$119 in Jan 2020 from newegg global.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5472,If thats the case the
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5472,I think just getting the base model then doing the ram upgrades and ssd upgrades diy is more cost efficient
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5473,Near MX130.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5474,This is true.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5474,"When I got my E485, the funny thing was upgrading to 8GB from the default 4GB did not cost anything."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5474,So I went for the 8GB and bought another 8GB stick from Amazon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5475,I think it will be good if you do some comparison first.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5475,"RAM wise, I believe it will be more cost efficient."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5475,"For SSD wise, I am not 100% sure because you need to have an SSD in the first place, and the upgrade cost to get a 256 or 512GB is not that significant."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5476,my own t495s went with 512gb ssd and 16gm ram.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5476,only thing I regretted was not adding the WWAN
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5476,anyone knows what is the maximum capacity for the sd card slot?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5477,WWAN card cost only $30 at aliexpress.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5477,But have to check if the antenna is installed or not.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5477,Max SSD supported might be 2TB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5477,I'm using 2TB on my E495 with no problem
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5478,I hope you are not planning to use the SD card slot as an alternative storage for your laptop though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5478,I rather you install a 2TB SATA SSD than to spend a fortune getting an SD card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5478,It is not cost effective and significantly slower than a proper SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5478,"As to your question, I doubt there is a limit currently."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5478,"The biggest micro SD storage size is 1TB currently, but that will cost as much as a 2TB SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5479,sigh...... not only that....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5479,i need the Lenovo Thinkpad Sim card + SD card hybrid slot as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5479,2TB...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5479,cool!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5479,i am thinking to increase both ssd & microSD in the near future when price drop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5479,the SD card....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5479,I just using as a backup
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5480,My advise is not to spend a fortune on a SD card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5480,It is not worth it at all.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5480,"Just a 512GB cost you as much as a 512GB NVME drive, and it is painfully slow and not a reliable storage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5480,"If you need that much storage, invest in a NAS or use a Cloud account."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5481,waiting for the new AMD chips..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5481,can't wait to see what they can do.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5482,think you buy USB3 thumb drives or SSD better for backups
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5483,Thumb drives are not much better than SD cards in my opinion.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5483,"While they can be faster than SD cards, but they just as much as a high capacity SD card."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5484,Likewise.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5484,In fact I am more excited about the desktop APU since it will make a good low power computer with good graphics.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5485,"Thanks for responding, bro."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5485,I came across this comment by a reviewer:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5485,"If it had not been for the problem with the high-pitched fan noise, the T495s would have received our unconditional recommendation."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5485,Cheers!

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5486,This can be a simple call to Lenovo Singapore
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5486,Still.... we Have to look at the total number of people who posted their comments about T495s.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5486,If it was only like a handful out of a few thousands...

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5487,"It will be higher pitch due to the slim body of the laptop, thus, smaller/ slimmer laptop fan."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5499,"If you need it by Monday, then online stores will not be an option for you because they generally take at least 2 business days to get the product to your place."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5500,I feel the difference between the 2 boils down mostly to the size & weight.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5500,"You have more customization option when it comes to the screen and camera on the T series, but that's about it from my observation."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5501,"my nb aso all usb-c , what you guys use as 'thumbdrive' ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5502,Probably can use those USB-A to usb-c adapter

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5503,I'm using Samsung T5 for bigger files and multiple Sandisk SDCZ43
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5504,Not all adapters are created equal though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5504,I bought a few different USB-A / USB C adapters/cables and some are only able to sustain USB 2.1 speeds.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5504,"While some indicate clearly they are USB 2 only, it's not always the case."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5505,is this usb-c ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5505,how is the speed?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5505,I use the scandisk and speed over my adaptor is horrendous
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5506,"The Sandisk is type A USB 3.0, 90+"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5506,MB/s write and 130
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5506,+
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5506,MB/s read.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5506,Never tried it with the good adapter which I left in office.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5506,"T5 is type C USB 3.1, I get 380 ~ 420 MB/s"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5506,read/
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5506,write large ISO with it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5506,"With the adapter, the T5 gets about 90% vs direct."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5506,"The adapters I use are USB-C one end T5, USB-A the other end  for laptop/ USB dock."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5506,edit
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5506,": I think this is the good one I'm using, based on my online orders history"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5507,I get like 1-2mb
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5507,/s sustained  for my usb-a over adaptor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5507,so high chance is my adaptor CMI?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5508,"Yeah, sounds like CMI adapter."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5508,You gotta check the adapter states explicitly it is USB 3.0 or 3.1 speed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5508,"If you see USB 2.0 or ""fast USB"", or 480Mbps, then it is not going to give you more than ~20MBps from my experiences."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5509,"then it should be the adaptor , 20/7 mb/s"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5509,maybe should get the usb-c scandisk type..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5510,huan will work ma?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5512,and it is a USB 2.0 part
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5512,so you won't get full speed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5513,BIOS update

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5516,"First time I updated my BIOs for my E485 as well, a few days back."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5516,"And yes, the first time it booted, the fans were almost running at full speed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5516,"However from second boot onwards, the fans are just as silent as before."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5517,"Actually if there is nothing wrong with the laptop/ desktop, best not to meddle with firmware."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5517,"I've been experiencing some issues with the laptop, and therefore, decided to take the plunge."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5517,So far this firmware seems ok and I have not experience the issues.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5518,"Usually after BIOS update, recommend to load Factory defaults."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5518,*
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5518,"Note, if there any configuration done to the BIOS."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5518,You will have to take note to change them back.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5519,think this one is to fix the usb c thing..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5519,also done it..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5519,so far seems okay
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5520,"Just bought x395, manage to get discount till $1106.64 ystd."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5520,The shipping really
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5520,that long?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5520,Anyone can advise?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5520,From point of purchase to delivery how long?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5521,Normal - less than 2 weeks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5521,Now - 1 to 3 months.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5522,"It will take longer than usual because of the supply chain disruption, and limited flights for shipping."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5522,Fastest I think is around 3 to 4 weeks based on an order made during the tech show week.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5523,Wooohooo!!!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5523,Welcome
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5523,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5524,The latest BIOS for my E485 seems to have fixed an issue where the system will randomly boot into repair mode at startup.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5524,At least I have not seen it happen after I updated.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5525,Any ryzen gaming laptop coming ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5525,With 1660ti or 2060?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5526,"In SG have model like Asus TUF FX505DT, Ryzen 5 3550H"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5526,Geforce
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5526,1660TI.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5526,Challenger should have but
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5526,the specs I share may not be same.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5526,It's a rare model since AMD laptop are not popular in retail space.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5527,Can take some pics of your x395?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5527,How long have u own it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5528,Yes I agree.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5528,"While AMD is getting more popular, finding a laptop with AMD chip in the big electronics companies like Challenger, Best Denki, Harvey Norman, Courts, etc, is still quite challenging."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5528,"The most you find runs a Ryzen APU, and not exactly a high end model."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5528,Singaporeans will still mainly go for a brand they feel that is more reputable I guess.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5531,I am looking to get a thinkpad
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5531,e495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5531,but the shipping states 4-8 weeks.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5531,Anyone with experience to share on the shipping?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5532,Im also looking at it.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5532,"E595 with the similar config ram and ssd will be 840, about 100$ more"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5533,I ordered on 23 Jan. Back then shipping estimated was within 2 weeks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5533,"On 15 Feb, I emailed customer service."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5533,"They say will have delay, unable to provide firm shipping date."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5533,"No updates until 1st March, finally got update."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5533,Estimated shipping date : 15 April 2020.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5533,Up to you how to interpret it.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5536,So bad!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5536,Did they offer further discount for the long wait?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5537,Looks cool.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5537,Let us know on the lead time!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5538,"Unlikely, haha these things have to demand one."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5538,They didnt even have the courtesy to apologize and inform on the delay
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5539,"Frankly speaking, I will still go for the ThinkPad E595."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5539,The i5 10210U is nothing new and just an overclocked i5 8xxx or 9xxx.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5539,"Graphic wise, it is still rubbish relative the to Vega 8 GPU on the 3500U."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5539,"Unless the Intel processor comes with a dedicated graphics like a minimal of Radeon 530 or Nvidia MX130, it is not attractive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5539,Warranty wise
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5539,", I think its a year for the Acer."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5539,At least you have the option of 3 years onsite warranty with the ThinkPad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5539,Only deal breaker now is the long wait time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5539,I cancelled my order recently because of this reason as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5540,Quite unlikely they will offer further discount since the laptop is already very discounted for the specs and they have already charged your credit card for the amount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5541,Looking to get a windows laptop for microsoft office - excel/word etc.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5541,Currently using Apple.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5541,Would like to get thoughts between ThinkPad X395/T495s vs. Yoga series C740?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5542,ThinkPad for me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5542,My current ThinkPad T410 still superb after 8 years.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5543,"X series light and long battery, T series business, yoga series light."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5543,X or T should be suitable for you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5544,"If I upgrade my own ssd, ram and m2, will it void the warranty?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5545,"Unlikely, unless you damaged any components as a result of tampering with the laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5545,"I did noticed that in some reviews, Lenovo seems to have slapped a warranty sticker over the NVME SSD screw, so if that is the case, then you cannot upgrade the NVME SSD without voiding warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5546,Couldnt wait for it to land.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5546,Ended up getting a 2nd hand dell xps15 9550.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5546,Came with 1tb ssd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5546,Got it for a good price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5547,Any body knows of any coupon for lenovo?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5548,Do Lenovo send an email confirmation upon a successful online purchase?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5549,"Looks good, where you order from?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5549,I looking to replace an office desktop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5550,"Yes, if you are looking to make a claim for it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5551,bought online from lenovo
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5552,bought online from lenovo online store
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5553,Do take note of the delivery timeline there.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5553,"I feel the deals are more attractive there, but may take sometime to get delivered."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5553,Last I checked was 3 to 5 weeks.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5558,Sent from Google PIXEL 3 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5559,Just ordered my x395 on Friday Night.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5559,a few questions.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5559,1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5559,Can I reformat the whole OS then install all the drivers/software from the site?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5559,or are
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5559,some only available preinstalled.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5559,Reason why I am doing this is coz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5559,I have a 100% clean build of win 10 Pro 0 bloatware or m$
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5559,"""free"" games, software, etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5559,"Will want to clean wipe then install only the drivers, and Lenovo utilities."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5559,2 is the micro-SD card reader also a nano Sim reader?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5559,can I use a data sim card?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5560,There arent many pre-installed software in the default.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5560,The notable one is the Vantage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5560,I reformat and and reinstall the OS and the drivers from Lenovo when I received my T495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5560,"Before that, you have to create the bootable thumb drive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5560,Instructions are found on Lenovo site.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5560,The microSD reader and SIM reader are different.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5560,The SIM reader is only functional if you have selected this option during the order and the modem will be installed in the machine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5560,"Otherwise, it will just be a SIM card slot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5560,Not sure if the same goes to your X395.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5561,"No problem, my suggested steps: - Prepare the OS installation USB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5561,- Prepare and download the drivers from Lenovo. -
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5561,"During OS install, do not connect to internet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5561,This is to prevent OS from installing the driver on
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5561,it's own.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5561,"=- After OS install, than load all the driver before connecting
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                to internet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5561,=- Utilities like Lenovo Vantage and etc.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5561,can load after everything is done.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5562,yeah..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5562,I will definitely reinstall vantage after I reformat.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5562,I already have a clean build of windows 10 ver 1903.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5562,advantages of working in IT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5562,haha...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5562,we clean install all PCs when we get them.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5562,sim card slot?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5562,I didn't have that option.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5562,only WWAN which I did not select.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5562,I saw some posts here that they have internet access with simcard.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5562,hence im confused
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5562,haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5562,Yup... that is my plan.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5562,I know drivers can be found on the support page of your laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5562,Just enter serial number.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5563,What abt using Windows 10 recovery function where u can format windows 10
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5563,so without reinstalling the entire OS?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5564,"That one is different, is basically wipe any data as well as program and driver to original state."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5564,Useful if you want to sell the PC without leaving any data behind as well as any issue reset will be useful.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5564,Reinstall typically is for better performance for new PC since most use factory image which comes with bloatware.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5564,As well as when there is new Windows build than typically reinstall the OS will be recommended.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5565,Now is ver 1909 not 1903.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5566,I know.. use windows update to get 1909 lol..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5567,Recommend you to build a new Windows USB Installer with build 1909.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5567,"Save time from updating to 1909 as well as when Windows update,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5567,it will update from 1909/concurrent period.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5567,1903 and
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5567,previous build might take longer to update along with it's.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5567,own patches at the time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5568,idk if the microsoft site's 1909 is clean..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5568,"the 1903 is what my office uses hence its ""certified clean"""
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5569,No problems.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5569,I did a clean install after swapping out the SSD on my E485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5569,Works fine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5570,Microsoft direct ISO builder are as clean as it can get.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5570,Unless your office using specialized ISO version with stripped features.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5571,"Hi not sure if this is off topic.. would like to know from people here, in terms of durability/ ""steady laptop"", can help to differentiate the thinkpad t495 vs the hp elitebook 745 g6?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5572,Thinkpad will be better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5572,"HP Elitebook cost more, quality wise"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5572,especially keyboard Thinkpad still is better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5573,"if u ask this in a hp thread, they say hp is better."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5573,"if u ask this here, then they will say lenovo is better."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5573,"anyway, lenovo ThinkPad are notoriously known for its durability."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5574,Saw x395 review damn good.... ticked on all the checkboxes ....can even use for gaming
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5575,I didn't actually see an amd elitebook thread
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5575,so i threw the question here
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5575,.. was hoping on a more balanced feedback.. apparently the elitebook doesn't have any review for it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5575,Hence have to ask.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5575,I am biased towards lenovo too..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5575,but the t495 build seems similar to 745 G6 and has two sodimms compared to t495's 1 sodimm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5576,My laptop has been shipped.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5576,Expected arrival end of this week.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5577,Is the shipping time accurate?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5577,shows that its shipping out on 11 May!!!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5577,and expected to arrive on 15 May...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5577,VR has alr been shipped tho
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5577,so...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5577,I guess I can play VR during the lockdown $1 for the VR if you're asking
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5578,Any comments to get the base e595 with dummy hdd and upgrade ram and ssd?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5578,Will it cause warranty issues later on?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5579,"Objectively, I avoid HP laptops for retail consumers due to the poor experiences."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5579,However the Elitebook targeted for corporate users seems to be significantly better in terms of reliability and quality.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5579,I was using one in my company that last well over 3 years without any problems.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5579,"The current ThinkPad I am using is more on the budget end my personal laptop, so will not be a good comparison for me to make."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5580,hi thanks for sharing..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5580,"upon looking at it the amd 745 G6 isn't offered in SG, and it is alot pricier than the thinkpad counterpart."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5580,"for this month, it is just hard to decide, waiting for the zen2 mobiles for a better worth it buy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5581,Whats a good price to pay for 2nd-hand T470s?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5582,I've been researching quite a bit
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5582,and I've come to a conclusion...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5582,T490s vs T495s.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5582,If both are around the same price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5582,Which would be better?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5582,I understand that the intel T490s has better battery life.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5582,Anyone have real life experience with this 2 comparison in terns of battery life differences?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5583,Intel
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5583,if same price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5583,Battery battery and has Thunderbolt 3 for added expansion capability such as eGPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5583,"Only thing you lose is modular WiFi card since it's soldered on, unlike the AMD version which is a removable card."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5584,intel has better battery life?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5585,"same here.. ordered a ""ready to ship"" laptop.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5585,it said within 2 weeks..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5585,now it shows May 15..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5585,feel like scammed..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5586,"I think when you say same price, what are the specs that you are looking at?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5586,Generally any Intel laptop will cost more than one that runs AMD chips.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5586,And it is also generally true that the current AMD APU is not as power efficient as compared to an Intel equivalent.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5586,However the AMD integrated GPU is significantly faster.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5586,So it depends on your usage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5587,i think nowadays they ship faster.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5587,i ordered 2 weeks ago then yesterday informed me that they have shipped and scheduled to arrive this saturday.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5588,what freebies are you guy able to ask to waive off?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5589,"So my AR/VR kit, bags have arrived."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5589,but not the laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5589,-_-
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5589,now ETA is
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5589,June smlj sia...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5589,"from May, to Apr now June.. help la"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5589,who can I call/contact to F?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5589,I alr emailed them
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5590,"I think its a shortage of parts, not just limited to Lenovo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5590,I recently purchased an Acer laptop 25th Mar with Intel i5 8250U also got delayed till early May.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5590,"They eventually sent an email that due to overwhelming demand, my order is in backlog, and my order got cancelled."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5591,I went to check the online site again today.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5591,"the only ""shortage"" at the customization page is the Ethernet dongle and 65W charger."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5591,Both of which are actually external devices..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5591,the cpu I chose doesn't show a shortage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5591,neither does the ssd
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5591,the 256gb one has a waiting time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5591,but I chose 512.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5591,"also, did you cancel the order or did they cancel it for you?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5592,"Waiting for third generation Ryzen 4000 series to be inside the ThinkPad, will hoot the highest spec!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5592,Hopefully Lenovo will offer these.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5593,Anyone uses this laptop?Hows the performance and any issue encountered?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5594,Same for me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5594,Bought the t495s estimated delivery date in June.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5594,Ask them to cancel
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5594,but they ask me if I wanna proceed with a gst waive
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5595,Looking at around the same spec.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5595,T490s Intel i5 vs T495s Ryzen 5.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5595,Just that intel model Im thinking of buying a slightly second hand at around the same price as a new t495s
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5596,"True, but they cannot ship you a laptop without a charger."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5597,"I actually don't think you need the highest specs, especially when you are looking at the 15W chips."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5597,Most should find the R7 4700U with HT/ SMT sufficient and have a good balance between a good CPU and GPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5597,Most 15W chips are simply too power starved to maintain a good boost when both the CPU and GPU are under load.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5597,"They can likely boost up to 25W, but depends on the cooling solution."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5598,did u email or call them?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5598,My ETA keeps changing
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5598,so idk what to do anymore...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5598,true..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5598,but how can chargers be OOS?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5598,isn't it paired with the laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5598,EDIT: Just called them.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5598,Apparently there's a CPU shortage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5598,the rest of the parts are available.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5598,"Also, I told them to mark my account as corporate as I do make purchases on behalf of my company at times"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5598,EDIT 2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5598,: emails still 0 replies after 3 sends...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5598,And my bank charged me today.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5598,Does this mean my laptop has been shipped?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5599,Looking good..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5599,hope thinkpad don't disappoint.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5600,"Anyone received the E595 without backlit keyboard  LED icon on spacebar , my order mentioned the product came with backlit 6-row ultranav, was shown on website during order, today it does not show it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5600,False advertising?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5601,My Lenovo laptop is on its way here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5601,"Upon receiving, i plan to reinstalll fresh windows to remove some bloatwares."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5601,Do I need the windows key or it will automatically activate once I log into windows with internet connection?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5601,"Driver wise, I should go into Lenovo website to automatically update most of the drivers but directly go to AMD website to get chipset drivers and radeon software right?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5602,The key is registered to your laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5602,"If you want to play it safe, you can log in first before reinstalling to check if it is activated."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5602,"As for chipset driver, yes you can get it from AMD's site."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5603,I thought the E series don't come with backlit keyboard?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5604,the win10 license is hardcoded to the bios
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5605,that is correct for E series AMD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5605,"E series intel has backlit kb, but if anybody is asking whether can use the same backlit kb and install on the AMD model, answer is no."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5606,thanks all.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5606,i need to remove all the bloatware that's why i intend to reinstall windows.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5607,I suggest getting from your own laptop's serial number page as its customised..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5607,But ya.. I will do a first time login before wiping too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5607,yes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5607,but you can upgrade OS too..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5607,I Plan to do the same too
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5608,anyone can advise?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5608,not shipped but billed alr..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5608,-_-
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5608,"called them 4 times, emailed 4 times with 0 replies.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5608,supposed to get callback from sales dept
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5608,but no reply.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5608,idk what to do anymore..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5609,Tell bank to cancel transaction.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5610,will I still get the laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5610,"also, what if bank asks for transcation cancellation slip?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5610,I've got that before
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5611,"They should whack this on the thinkpad extreme series, right now their T-series do not offer 4k screen on Singapore site."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5612,The bank will only hold the payment while they investigate.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5612,"They will not cancel the payment because clearly the order is not cancelled, and they are not authorized to do that."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5612,Unless otherwise it is a fraudulent transaction.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5613,"They will surely ask you for proof why you need to cancel the transaction, and will also investigate with the seller."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5613,They can't just cancel the payment without validation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5613,"Unfortunately, this is common practice."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5613,"I've recently placed an order on Harvey Norman, and they did the same."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5613,"They charged my card, then drop me and email to notify me that the item's delivery is in backlog and will need up to 30 days to deliver."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5613,"I checked the order status online, and the dates got moved for more than a month."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5613,They took 2 weeks to respond to my query and cancelled the order without confirming with me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5613,"So now I am waiting for the refund, that takes up to 30 days due to the COVID19 situation."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5614,wtf is going on man..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5614,is it so hard to reply email?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5614,I sent Lenovo and cannot get anything.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5614,btw
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5614,", ship date changed to 22nd Apr"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5614,but I don't know who to trust anymore..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5614,"also, other than drivers etc.. is Lenovo vantage the only useful software that I need to download after wiping clean?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5614,Can I not download the rest of the software?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5615,Generally most coy/office are not operating as well as overwhelm
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5615,thus either delay in response or no response at all.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5615,"Depend on model, example E595 other than Vantage, software like hotkeys integration"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5615,This is for KB shortcuts as well as intelligent thermal solution.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5616,yeah..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5616,but no excuse to not read emails..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5616,even im doing IT support
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5616,and I need to read emails tho
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5616,I cannot physically support
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5616,lol..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5616,I bought X395
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5617,The extreme series will use the HS or H series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5617,U is unlikely.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5617,since U only 15w.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5617,extreme like its name will likely use 35w or 45w chips.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5617,Provided they even come out with AMD versions for the extreme.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5618,"hi, does anyone find the text display in x395 blurry, especially on some applications."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5618,is there any way to resolve this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5618,Thanks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5619,Try update the driver from Lenovo?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5619,Their latest driver is 3rd April so quite recent.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5620,"For X395, I could suggest: - Hotkey feature for keyboard shortcuts."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5620,- Power management driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5620,Other than that will be just drivers for most of the devices like.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5620,"graphic, WIFI and etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5621,Lenovo fn keys are weird..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5621,I just set the default..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5621,fn+key for features.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5621,alt+f
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5621,keys for normal..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5621,supposed to press both or something
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5621,idk..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5621,power management driver is included in the page right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5621,Im referring to software lol.. other than vantage
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5622,The shopback are good for online purchase too
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5623,The performance of the gpu for 4800U is quite close to a mx250 from nvidia.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5623,tasty indeed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5624,"I think its certainly catching up, but should not be anywhere that close to the MX250 in games."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5624,This is especially so when looking at the 15W version due to power and thermal constraints when both CPU and GPU are under load.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5624,"If it is a R7 4800U paired with an MX250 as a comparison, the CPU can take the full 15W, and GPU an additional 25W, though it will be more challenging to keep both components cool."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5625,"then again, I wouldn't mind less power consumption in an ultra portable.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5625,I have a desktop to game
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5626,I don't disagree.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5626,In fact I am eyeing a laptop with R7 4700U.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5626,It should be more than sufficient for my usage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5627,Its
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5627,bumper that none can add up to 32gb ram....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5628,Which models can't bump RAM up to 32GB?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5629,I think the CS are scared of replying since I am sure they would have gotten a lot of angry customers chasing them for status.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5629,"After all, they are the messengers and not able to really influence the factory to send it out soon."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5629,"Another 2 more days man, hope they really ship it out."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5629,"As for drivers, I got most from Lenovo except for the AMD drivers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5629,"If any updates, Vantage will take care of it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5630,why cant get amd drivers from Lenovo itself?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5630,"also, finally got my tracking number"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5631,If order from lenovo website need pay for custom gst?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5632,X395 max is 16gb
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5633,How long from order before you get tracking number?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5634,6 core 4500u uses same amount of power as 4 core 3500u but 40% faster
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5635,20 days
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5635,u pay online when u buy
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5636,Wah..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5636,That long..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5636,I just ordered over the weekend...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5636,So at least 3 weeks wait for it...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5637,Its factored into the price you pay when you checkout on Lenovo Singapore's website.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5638,"You can, but the AMD drivers on Lenovo's site may not be as up to date."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5639,can share the link?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5639,im using integrated cards for GPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5639,so I thought just download the chipset drivers
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5639,and it will be fine
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5640,impressive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5640,can't wait for 4800u or 4900u !
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5640,near 60 fps versus 35
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5640,+
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5640,fps  for 3500u in the game.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5641,Same vega gpu.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5641,only 5% improvement
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5642,5%?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5642,"based on the video numbers, doesn't seem like it?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5643,The improvements are definitely greater than 5% despite the drop in 2 CUs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5644,"Anyway, just wanted to give people buying Lenovo laptops a headsup."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5644,"It seems that even with the extended warranty, the battery warranty is still limited to a year."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5644,"So if your battery starts acting up like on my E485, then you are on your own."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5645,is there any way to remove the battery and use the laptop on adapter?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5646,"Don't think so, some laptop can adjust the setting either through Lenovo Power management or BIOS."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5646,There should be a setting to change to always plug in or so.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5647,"The battery is built in, so its not convenient to take them out easily."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5647,I also feel its pointless to take the battery out for a laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5647,"If you dont use them often, it will degrade too."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5647,"Moreover, you can set the max charge to say 80% and to recharge only when it falls to 70% or less."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5647,"This way, the battery wont charge all the time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5648,Still waiting for its tech refresh
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5648,Sent from Rem Best Grill using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5649,when zephyrus g14 will b available?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5649,price will b <2k?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5650,Ideally yes since I am expecting Renoir gaming laptops to be in the USD 1000 segment.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5650,"After all, all Renoir laptops are in the low to mid range gaming laptops."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5650,The top end RTX are unfortunately exclusive to Intel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5650,Hopefully AMD can release their higher end RX series graphics in Renoir based laptops soon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5651,"Laptop finally arrived
."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5651,"Bought on 3rd Apr,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5651,Just reached 30 mins ago..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5651,gonnna charge the batteries first then full wipe.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5651,after that can enjoy
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5652,Congrats!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5652,At least it arrived in 3 weeks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5653,Wooohoooo!!!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5653,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5654,Drives wiped.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5654,Fresh OS installed and patched.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5654,will install the rest of what I need tomorrow
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5655,hopefully comes soon because china lenovo already selling 4500u
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5656,Lenovo Yoga.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5656,"May start to sell in china,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5656,4999 rmb about
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5656,1k SGD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5656,AMD version only got 1 heatpipe
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5656,though
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5656,Hope thinkpad got good heat management.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5656,Acer 4700u performance
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5657,How do you do that?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5657,Wipe and fresh install?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5658,You can buy additional battery warranty for up to 3-5 years depending on ur basic warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5659,Make sure you boot into your laptop beforehand.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5659,Go download the Microsoft program for Upgrade or Make USB boot drive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5659,Then use that boot drive to install fresh Windows 10.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5659,It'll auto match your Home or Pro Type
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5659,....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5659,else there's a universal CD key for you to key in the product key page.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5659,"MAKE SURE to be offline when you do it, then it'll upgrade your OS from HOME to PRO."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5659,"After that, just log back online."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5659,That's only if you have the PRO version of Windows 10.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5660,i thing good about thinkpad
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5660,is they tend to have stock for old laptops.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5661,"Just checked with the Lenovo Singapore CS, and they confirmed that there will be updates with Renoir next month on their products."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5662,started selling in UK
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5662,max config is around 1300 for 15 inch
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5662,ram unsure if dual channel
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5662,though
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5663,May?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5663,good news.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5663,can't wait to see what thinkpad can offer
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5664,Is the discussion in this thread the Lenovo Xiaoxin series?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5665,Hope they will have high end amd high-end thinkpad with high resolution screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5665,They tend to sell lower stuff and poor screen in SG.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5665,"E.g., Extreme gen 2, if you buy i7 you cannot customised and most screens only FHD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5665,Come on give us a Ryzen 9 4000 thinkpad with a 4k screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5666,Which one is likely to be more durable？.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5666,T495 or X395
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5666,Both advertised to be very durable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5667,I don't feel that a 4K screen is required on a laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5667,Especially when Windows 10 is quite poor in scaling.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5667,I prefer a decent IPS screen with faster refresh rate and good brightness.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5668,"Between the 2, you should be considering the screen size and weight."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5668,Build wise is usually good for the T and X series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5669,"It could be dual channel, but I noticed 2 things about Lenovo of late, 1. 1 stick of ram to upgrade, the other is soldered."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5669,2.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5669,"They tend to gimp the ram speed on the lower end, i.e. Ryzen 3xxx supports up to 2666mhz of ram, but is limited to 2400 on the E series."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5669,Not too sure about the T series though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5669,"If the options are not good, I will look elsewhere this time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5669,Still somewhat disappointed with the 1 year battery warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5669,Need to read up from other manufacturers to see if the same is applicable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5670,144Hz refresh rate.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5671,What model is this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5671,Lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5672,yay.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5672,better hold off one month...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5672,also next years cpu will finally have upgraded gpu.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5673,"Well, can't chase after technology all the time man."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5673,I feel the current Renoir is good enough largely due to the benefits of the shrink from 12nm basically a refined 14nm to a 7nm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5673,"Ryzen 5 is a architecture improvement on both the CPU and GPU, so should see better benefits."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5674,450 nits is very bright though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5674,I feel 300 nits is good enough for me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5674,A good and high refresh rate IPS screen will be good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5675,"See Lenovo or asus one fit my budget bo, leaning towards to asus due to the design"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5675,Sent from Rem Is Best Waifu using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5676,"yea, a good color IPS good brightness at full HD for 15 or 14 inch is definately great."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5677,My decision will depend on the cooling solution.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5677,"As it stands, Lenovo tend to use a single fat or dual thin heatpipe to draw heat away from the processor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5677,This is the case for the E series at least.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5677,"I feel the cooling solution is average, if not on the poor side as it gets hot quite quickly."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5677,The likes of Acer Swift 3 is the same if I am not mistaken.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5678,Their screen is always look quality in terms of sGRB and Adobe RGB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5678,"Moe and more people are emphasing on good, bright screen, and it's one of the thing we look at daily besides the keyboard."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5679,only high end model has got 100% sRGB and 100% Adobe RGB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5680,300 is just nice for indoor with lights... outdoor with sun a bit too dim
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5680,Lenovo will last longer than asus.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5680,esp the thinkpads
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5681,My company is using all Asus and slow down after a while.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5681,End lasy year
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5681,"I hoot 5 thinklad for them during sales, and they chua tio thinking it's expensive, in fact it cost the same as Asus with higher specs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5682,I stop supporting Asus laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5682,Mainly due to after sales support isn't that good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5682,For business recommend get brands like Dell or Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5683,yeah..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5683,most companies I see these days use dell or Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5683,occasionally HP..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5684,"Most companies go for the one that quotes them the lowest, or best deal."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5684,Asus is unlikely to break into the corporate laptop market that easily.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5684,"The big 3 if I am not mistaken are Lenovo, HP and Dell."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5685,The screen looks better only because 4K laptop monitors are deemed as high end range.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5685,"In fact, generally any laptop monitor above 1080p, i.e. 1440p, etc, will be expected to come with better color reproduction and brighter backlight."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5686,I read this comment.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5686,"Make quite alot of sense that being so thin, won't it matters to the durability whether in term of airflow in the internal or from breakage when it drops."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5686,The ethernet port is useful imo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5686,The only thing disappointing is can only get the 3 cell battery
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5686,Other comments suggest that X395 is using the new carbon material that is lighter.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5686,I'm also wondering is the X395 more cramp than the T495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5686,"I've read some reviews on the blue screen on the T495 though,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5686,not sure if it is fixed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5687,X395 is magnesium.. and I really love the lightweight
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5688,For budget.. this is really good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5688,can't wait to see
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5688,thinkpad T series with 4800u.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5688,hope they don't gimp the cooling.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5689,"At first i counted the T495s out cause it's labelled $15xx onward, but base on my config, only $100-$150 more exp than the X395/T495"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5689,Look like it's in my top list now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5689,The battery life is better than the X395.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5689,"The screen is 14"" 400nits."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5689,X395's highest 400nits has an eprivacy filter which i don't want
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5690,"There are lesser laptops with good sRGB and adobe RGB settings, as they cost a bit more."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5690,The lenovo ideapad with 4500 only has a 64% sGRB adn 48% Adobe RGB while the Macbook air had 97% sRGB and 78% Adobe RGB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5690,Lenovo could have added another hundred to make a better screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5691,what is the x395 sGRA and RGB percentage?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5692,"the only downside is its screen nia, otherwise will be perfect"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5693,wait for higher end model  more $  of course.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5694,Wait for Yoga Slim 7... that one got 100% sRGB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5695,See the updated E and the T series first
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5695,Sent from Rem Is Best Waifu using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5696,uk has really good deal on the new ryzen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5697,The base model not very enticing... need to do some additional customization.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5697,Max out the spec cost around 1500 SGD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5698,can't wait for the T series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5699,To be honest the max out spec @ 1500sgd isn't really too bad of a deal if you need it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5700,The IdeaPad 5 series is a step up from the usual ThinkPad E series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5700,I am using an IdeaPad 5 with Intel processor
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5700,and I would say the build quality is quite good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5700,"But I feel if its 1.5K for the max out specs, it is on the pricey side, but still a decent deal considering you are rocking an 8c/16t processor in there."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5701,This is likely to cost more than the IdeaPad 5.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5701,"And hopefully, the cooler will be enough to allow the CPU to stretch itself to its full potential."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5702,"You should be able to customize the screen to a better and brighter one, though you will not be getting cutting edge screens at the low to mid end range of laptops."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5703,Another downside is that it cannot output 4k@60hz...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5703,Only 4k@30hz.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5703,To me this is a deal-breaker in 2020
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5704,"yea, if can be cheaper will be a solid buy"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5705,Hope they got massive discount like last time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5705,confirm hot cakes!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5706,I feel it is a PC manufacturers' problem in this case.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5706,"Just like on the desktop where most mobo makers stick to HDMI 1.4, and DP 1.2, instead of going with the updated HDMI 2.0 and DP 1.4 standards."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5706,"There are handful of mobos with HDMI 2.0, but not common for the AMD chipsets."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5707,The price will certainly be better for laptops with AMD processors.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5707,"Just that while this is new, and the only good 6 and 8 cores U series processor, PC manufacturer will take the opportunity to charge a premium, i.e. not providing much discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5707,Unless you don't mind waiting till later in the year to take the plunge.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5708,"not enough volume to support ba..
who will use onboard graphics these days."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5708,those who only use onboard don't even know the diff between hdmi 1.4 and hdmi 2.0.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5709,very good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5709,4800 looking more delicious by the day.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5709,hope no gimp!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5710,I think hor if go for U proc.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5710,better get the slowest of all  which is still faster than most intel gen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5710,because I feel usually U the fan also
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5710,beh zai one
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5711,"looks like I bought my x395 too early..
."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5711,but ok la.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5711,1.3k a bit too hard to pass up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5711,"3500u, 512ssd, 16gb ram"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5712,a lot of ppl say wait for renoir but........
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5713,x395 is lightweight
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5713,so I don't think you will regret.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5713,Successor to this model
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5713,I don't think will be announce so soon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5714,yes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5714,I bought mainly for the light weight...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5715,Successor to the X395 isn't the X13 AMD meh?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5716,"3300u, 3500u or 3700u"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5717,waiting for high end
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5717,AMD Thinkpad
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5717,but don't think it will happen anytime soon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5718,Lenovo will never sell gaming laptops
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5719,The Legion line is aimed at gamers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5719,"There's also the L340, which was a low cost gaming laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5720,"AMD mobile for so long, no manufacturer have push for high end."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5720,Generally AMD laptop are found in low cost or mid range laptops.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5720,but no high end.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5721,GTA is so playable evewn with renoir U
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5722,whoa very impressive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5722,if they can pair the 4800U with decent cooling.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5722,this is gonna be a great AIO desktop or laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5723,a taste of what's to come?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5724,"I think with U , sure kena throttle......"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5724,for intel at least la
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5725,i think i just get the 4500U is sufficient liao
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5726,I also think so..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5726,I'm also thinking of something like
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5726,AsRock Deskmini A300 version  with Renoir A400 ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5727,"Not for gaming but higher specs ThinkPad, like putting Ryzen 9, and good solid screen for content creation."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5727,Don't really want to buy P2 even now that intel had lowered their CPU prices by a lot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5728,seems like there is no more ecoupon that can be used now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5729,im using 2400G quite satisfied with performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5729,can play guild wars 2 on low at 50fps 4k resolution
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5730,wait for it to update to renoir should be better
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5730,i Feel
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5731,save this as bookmark.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5731,once can order it will appear
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5732,yup better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5732,"Good thing about laptop and desktop apu is that it has vce for gpu acceleration when encoding video, something not found in low end nvidia like mx250"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5733,"Just want to check,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5733,does the monitor that comes with the laptop support HDR?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5733,or how can I check it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5734,4500u compared.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5734,15w and 25w
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5734,5 deg C/1 to 2 fps difference
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5735,think for 4500U leaving it at 15w better
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5736,That's why I can't wait for the desktop version actually.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5736,Most laptops unfortunately comes with poor cooling solution.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5737,Its not limited to Lenovo though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5737,The same goes to all the PC manufacturers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5737,"The top of the range is only limited to Intel processors, so you get a sense there is something fishy here."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5738,"I read about it sometime back, but it is very rare."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5738,"Most are limited to 400 nits, so HDR 400, which is negligible visually."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5738,I believe even the laptop OLED monitors are also limited to 400 nits based on specs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5739,It is interesting that its only 2 FPS difference.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5739,"In the video, the CPU seems to be sustained at a much higher clockspeed on the 25W test."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5739,So the bottleneck is probably the GPU in this case.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5740,OEM agreements I guess.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5740,"you scratch my back, I scratch yours?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5740,I would build my own laptop tbh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5740,but sg does not have that service.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5740,Mine is 300 nits.. but its not just about the brightness.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5740,"Its about the color gamut, or clarity right?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5740,instead of 8-bit its like 10-bit..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5740,but idk if my monitor has.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5740,how to check?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5741,Most build yourself laptops unfortunately are not as customizable as a PC.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5741,"Take Eurocom for example, they specializes in this sort of customization on a laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5741,"However if you realized, the level of customization is still very limited."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5741,"For HDR, I don't think there is a way to check if it is HDR compliant."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5741,"You are correct to say that HDR is not just about brightness, but also the color reproduction of the screen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5741,VESA standard suggests a minimal brightness level of 400 nits.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5742,Colour gamut can test using a colorimeter.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5742,"For Lenovo laptops, most are 45% NTSC or 72% NTSC"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5742,100% sRGB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5742,think the 4k displays all exceed 72% NTSC.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5742,Bit depth can check in display properties...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5742,But think most are still 8 bit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5742,10 bit simply means less colour banding when displaying gradients.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5743,Hope to see Lenovo Singapore bringing in AMD Renoir based laptops soon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5744,100% sRGB means 100% colour accuracy?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5744,"I guess aftershock is ""build yourself"".."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5744,but its gaming only..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5744,they sg doesn't have a DIY for laptops like PCs..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5745,T495 400 nits panel has got good sRGB of 98.6% and an adobe RGB of 63.5%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5745,Adobe RGB is not import if you are not doing offset printing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5745,I do hope that have 500 nits with 100% sGRB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5746,I bought X395.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5746,how do I check that?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5747,Aftershock's customization is not much of a customization.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5747,They have regressed over the years when it comes to customization.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5747,"As I understand, DIY laptops should be very rare, and should be very limited in terms of customization, unlike PCs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5747,"This is because different specs/ features tend to have a different motherboard design, which in turn affects cooling solution and chassis design."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5747,"If ever you find one that allows you to customize freely, it will likely cost a lot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5748,yea man!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5748,can't wait to see those thinkpads!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5748,hope they don't disappoint!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5749,I've been checking everyday since the start of May.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5750,seems like no high end
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5750,AMD cpu variant for thinkpad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5750,was hoping maybe the p series or xtreme series got the new amd cpu
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5751,I believe its Intel at work in the background.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5751,"If so, what a dirty way of hindering competition."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,Might not be solely the reason.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,Lenovo might have signed different exclusive deals with Intel based on different product lines.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,Example
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,T series 14 inches and 15 inches may have different contracts.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,14 inches exclusive deal ended and so Lenovo brought in AMD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,"Another reason might be, Lenovo signed a deal to buy certain number of 15W, 25W and 45W CPU every year in order to secure CPU numbers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,They might not be able to use up all 45W CPU from Intel and no point to buy more from AMD 45W variant if they cannot move on low volume products.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,Intel has a lack of CPU supply if any of you follow the news.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,"Big players like Dell, HP, Apple and Lenovo would likely sign deals that supply them certain numbers of CPU for not just 1 year, but typically 2-3 years."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,AMD scores product design wins mainly are the higher volume 15W Ryzen 3300U/3500U/3700U.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,"If I am Lenovo or one of the big players, I can afford to sell 10% of the sales from AMD Ryzen to 1 build up expertise in AMD system, 2 test market response, 3 meet market demand and 4 pressure Intel to give better renewal deals."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,"Remember, many people dont know AMD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,Reliability is a factor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,You need a certain discount to attract buyers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,A similar priced Intel whether on desktop or laptop can command a higher premium than AMD as seen in T series thinkpad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,I have no doubt 45W Ryzen will come to ThinkPad T15 and P15 series in 1-2 years when corporate clients look for replacement units after having 2-3 years using Ryzen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,Management approving wider use of Ryzen systems will be happy to take on 45W systems that command higher reliability.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5752,"If you are running a business and need critical support, would you use Singtel services or Grid Mobile?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,AMD Mobile products have not been popular since early days of Turion.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,till AMD FX Excavator CPU not the famous AMD FX-60 socket 939 which decimate Intel back in the early days.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,CPU have been weak and behind Intel counterpart so the selling point.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,isn't there.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,AMD perception have been tainted as slow and hot for so long
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,thus many will not risk it to buy one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,However the pricing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,is one factor some will get it as most model falls below $1k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,Market availability is also another question as AMD is exclusive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,to US and China mainly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,Only recent AMD Ryzen laptop than.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,more and more such laptop became to surface.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,However most model are either entry/mid but
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,no high end.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,have surface.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,"Models like Dell G5 SE AMD Ryzen, Lenovo Legion 5"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,so far no.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,news whether SG have them or not.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,I only know Dell SG do not bring in AMD based desktop/laptop as sales margin are generally poor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,Asus as well as Lenovo are actively bringing in AMD Ryzen laptop followed by Acer and HP.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,I have owned AMD based laptops from Turion till the last one the AMD A10 series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,Generally they are average performing laptop which cost less than $1k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,I stop buying AMD laptops before Ryzen laptops were available here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5753,I myself also hope to get a decent AMD 8 Core mobile laptop just waiting for the right model.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5754,what about Renoir 4k
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5754,haha???
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5755,Hi new to the forum here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5755,I will be starting school in July and was thinking of getting a E495/E595.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5755,I am looking at Ryzen 3500 but hesitant to buy now as the Ryzen 4000 seems to be launching soon
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5755,and Im waiting for a dip in price for the 3500 series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5755,Any suggestions on how much it would drop in price?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5755,"Given the supply chain disruption now due to covid, do you guys suggest I wait it out for the 4000 or just go ahead with the purchase now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5756,Agreed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5756,"I recall having an AMD laptop quite a number of years back, but its been so long that I can't recall when as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5756,The reason for getting it was due a decent integrated graphics and low price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5756,But I also recalled that it runs really hot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5756,Those were tough years for AMD because Intel is always ahead of them when it comes to having an advance fab.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5756,I feel detaching themselves from Globabl Foundry
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5756,actually helped AMD in the longer run.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5757,No harm waiting since it is expected to be available for order this month.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5758,"As mentioned, I recommend waiting."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5758,I just checked the price of current E495 and noticed it has gone up substantially.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5758,"I think even with base specs with a Ryzen 5 3500U, it will cost you over 1K."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5758,"Also, they removed some important upgrades like the IPS monitor option is gone."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5759,"Ok, will heed your advice and wait out for the a few more weeks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5759,I also realized that about the customization option of E495!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5759,They downgraded the FHD IPS panel to a HD TN panel with no customization option now!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5760,"Either way you have wait, order will need at least 2 weeks or 4 weeks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5760,I don't think price will drop a lot due to pandemic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5761,Is there any promo code for Lenovo?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5761,I only found a 3% off online.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5762,The integrated Radeon Graphic was one of the key selling despite.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5762,the weak CPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5762,Another issue with later generation AMD laptop in particular A10/FX based
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5762,laptops was drivers especially those with dual graphics.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5762,I had the Asus X550DP
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5762,the dual graphics mean IGP + discrete graphic
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5762,but keep crashing most of the time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5762,No driver was released to fix such issue thus I dump the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5763,means the new versions are coming
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5764,That is correct.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5764,"If I am not wrong, there are 2 versions of this graphic switching tech from AMD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5764,One of the Lenovo laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5764,I owned back then
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5764,had an Intel processor with an AMD graphic card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5764,"For that laptop, I recall I had to manually switch graphics, unlike Optimus that switches automatically most of the time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5764,The second gen was an auto switching one but it was very bad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5764,I think they have no $$$ as they were getting hit left right center by both Intel and Nvidia.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5765,I was thinking the same.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5765,"To be honest, the wait is very painful."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5765,Lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5766,actually what is the price difference btw a entry monitor to a good one?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5766,100 top up enough?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5766,So far I've yet to see renoirs with better screens
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5767,close to mx350 performance
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5768,you mean for the thinkpad options?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5768,i'm guessing around that price also.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5768,100-200
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5769,"I think it should be < $1,500 if it ever comes"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5769,"but I think maybe looking at other brands too HP, Dell or Acer."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5770,Price difference for a better monitor is not significant.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5770,"However due to product segmentation, they may not offer you a better monitor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5771,let's if dell will pick this up or not
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5772,if you ask me at that pricing...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5772,thinkpads are still better than the other brands u mentioned.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5772,Somehow the overall build is just better than the rest..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5772,others may look nicer but
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5772,the build and quality.. thinkpads still top notch imo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5773,Is it worth buying a second hand thinkpad without warranty?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5773,Saw a E495 3500U and 16GB RAM going at $650.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5773,Anyone got experience in buying 2nd hand thinkpads?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5773,Is it easy to self-repair?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5774,This integrated GPU is probably the most powerful at this point.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5774,"I suspect it is due to the 7nm shrink that probably allow the GPU to run at a higher clockspeed, sustain at a higher clockspeed, and to a large extend, the inclusion of faster memory."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5774,I am looking foward to see how the iGPU
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5774,in actual gaming benchmark agains the MX350.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5774,"I believe it will be faster than a MX250, but likely still trailing the MX350."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5774,Still for a 15W chip to perform closely to a 15W
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5774,+ 25W
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5774,Intel solution is  a big deal.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5774,Nvidia certainly is aware scrambling to put up a new low power GPU in face of competitors' iGPU catching up with their aged GPU in the low power range.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5775,"E495 is relative new model release last year, you can call to get"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5775,quote for warranty extension.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5775,Not sure what do you mean self-repair?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5775,Change
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5775,"RAM/SSD/HDD user still can do it, motherboard and LCD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5775,best to let service center do it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5776,here u go.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5776,largely mx350 still comes out top.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5776,but its not far behind.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5776,4800U plus good cooling will be quite a portable light gaming beast!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5777,if going for ultras
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5777,i'm quite concern with throttling...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5778,This issue is unavoidable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5778,Question is how bad will it throttle.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5778,"If you read recent review of the Acer Swift 3 with the Ryzen 7 4700U, the cooling system is very bad."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5778,"Even in my current E485, the heatsink is very small and you can clearly see it struggling to handle the heat."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5779,so is it possible to don't throttle?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5779,for example my lenovo S730 yoga multitask zoom also kena
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5780,if they can pair the 4800u or 4800u with good cooling and dual channel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5780,beasty
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5781,hope we won't have the pro options only..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5782,"The throttling is really to help manage the heat, so I don't think it is ideal to stop it from throttling."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5782,All modern CPUs have a temperature in which it will shutdown to prevent permanent damage due to overheating.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5782,The throttling is meant to keep it from reaching that temp.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5782,"For my case, what I do to improve cooling are,
1."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5782,"Replace the thermal compound - I am using Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut
2."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5782,Try and see if I can add some heatsink/ increase cooling surface area if space  in the laptop permits.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5782,3.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5782,Seal up gap between the heatsink and the exhaust if required - This will ensure hot air gets channeled out of the chassis directly and minimize hot air flowing back into the chassis
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5782,All these will help to a limited extend to allow a slightly longer boost.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5782,Throttling unfortunately is still inevitable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5783,Yeah I saw this.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5783,What puts me off is the date.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5783,So I guess there may be delays in Renoir laptops.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5784,I think usually ultrabooks very susah
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5785,covid covid
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5786,For laptop u dun need to be on high clock speed all the time
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5786,Sent from Rem Is Best Waifu using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5787,you try zoom on...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5787,it kept my total cpu @
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5787,0.2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5788,It is true because the slimness means compromises made with cooling.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5788,"However they can still make an effort to provide a decent cooling solution, i.e. dual heatsink fan cooler."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5788,Dual heatsink helps because it provides more surface area despite the thin heatsink.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5788,"Low/ mid range thin laptops usually sport a single fan, a measly thin heatsink, and a single fat or 2 thin heatpipes."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5788,"As a result, any load on the CPU will quickly bring the temps up drastically."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5789,agreed..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5789,dual heatsink fan cooler..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5789,dunno why they like to provide lousy cooling solutions
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5790,so can i assume dell xps 13 is the better ultrabook??
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5791,I think it is confirmed for a June release.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5791,Hope they won't move the dates again.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5791,"While I agree that COVID will impact release dates, but I feel it is a poorly coordinated effort by AMD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5791,They should first confirm if there are sufficient products to sell before officially announcing it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5791,It is like vaporware now since only reviewers seems to have them.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5791,On the contrary Intel managed to get the new processors into machines that are available to purchase.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5791,Unless of course there are conspiracy theories that Intel is behind the delays.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5792,"Yes, but it also comes with an eye watering price tag."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5793,Tomshardware took the Acer Swift 3 apart.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5793,There you can see the poor cooling solution which is standard issue for most low power processors.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5793,Unfortunately what they did not show is how thin the heatsink is.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5793,"There is actually space for better cooling in this chassis, but of course they choose the cheap option."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5794,damn.. was hoping a mid may release.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5795,so if got 2 fans means half the battle won liao hor
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5796,I think can wait and see.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5796,The link seems to refer only to ThinkPad and not to IdeaPad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5796,So perhaps you can still find an IdeaPad with an Renoir in it this month since it is already available for selected countries.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5797,That means sustained performance should be better with more surface area for cooling.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5798,I have the latest Dell XPS 9300
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5798,and it is hot AF even with the dual heatsink or whatever.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5798,A bit regret paying so much for this.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5798,The saving grace is that Dell support is awesome.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5798,I accidentally scratched my screen somehow and broke my microsd slot long story--for some reason
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5798,", my microSD card kept getting stuck inside and dell is replacing them for free under accidental damage..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5799,I actually considered XPS13 before settling down for the thinkpad X395.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5799,Apparently XPS' standards have dropped and quality too..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5799,and the price is not worth it according to a few people I spoke to.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5800,so probably need to search for vendor that has dual fans +
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5800,good screen for the renoir 4k then?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5801,"tbh, I don't see the point of 4K on a laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5801,drains too much battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5801,2k also considered too much alr on such a small screen..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5802,4k on renoir?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5802,i'll still take a great full HD screen for now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5802,at 14 or 15 inch.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5802,4k still is overkill.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5802,unless the battery can max out on the laptop which i don't think they will.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5802,hopefully one day integrated graphics will be so good that great screens with fast refresh rate will be the norm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5802,We will likely see more benefits for the avg consumer over 4k
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5803,ok la even phone also have 4k display
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5804,"honesty, hows the screen panel on the tp x395?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5804,i remember most thinkpads like those in my office have absolute garbage screen panels.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5805,Your office using IPS or TN panel?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5805,Upgrade to FHD and it will be IPS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5805,If using HD only it is TN and TN is garbage
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5806,yea but got difference ma?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5806,maybe if use for VR than the extra pixels will help..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5807,True even on IGP it is still demanding.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5807,"1080p will do fine for most laptop, if need 4K just use external monitor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5807,"Anyway for 4K smaller the screen size, amount of detail isn't very obvious."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5807,"Recommend size for 4K contents is 50"" and above."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5808,Thinkpad IPS is garbage too and TN should not be an option at all.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5808,"They need to do better, screen is something you look at daily."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5809,Why do you need a 4K laptop screen though?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5809,"Even at 1440p, you will need to scale the image up by 200% to see properly, and that is if Windows can scale it correctly."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5809,4K in my opinion is not useful on a laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5810,You can get up to an OLED screen on ThinkPads if you think the IPS is bad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5810,"At the top end range, they will use good IPS screen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5810,"At the mid and low end, don't expect them to give you super good screens."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5810,"Higher backlight, yes, but color reproduction is still going to be just average."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5811,I guess it is a side effect of being extremely thin.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5811,But thanks for the heads up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5812,4K is still uncommon on mobile phone.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5812,So far only Sony have been pushing out mobile phones with 4K screen to try and differentiate themselves.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5812,"However, I don't find it a meaningful upgrade."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5812,People would like 4K screen for watching movies or playing games in higher definition.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5812,"In both use cases, I won't want to use a 6 to 7 inch mobile phone if given a choice."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5812,Also the mobile OS handles the image scaling very well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5812,This is not the case with Windows.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5812,"It works in most cases, but when it does not work with say and older application, you are left with super small image/ fonts which you cannot read due to the size."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5813,"I don't need OLED I just want a good IPS, is that not fair enough?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5813,I am always buying AMD thinkpad yearly since ryzen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5813,If they put amd in 1 carbon or p2 wokstation I will by it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5814,Which doesn't make sense to me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5814,"If you feel the monitor is not great, you have the option not to buy from Lenovo isn't it?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5814,Instead you buy them yearly for a product that does not suit one of your main requirement.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5814,"Having a decent screen is one of the key requirements for me as well, though I suppose my expectation is not as high as yours."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5814,"As long as it is not a crappy TN or HD resolution screen, I think it is good enough for me considering that I am not paying top dollars for it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5814,"The E485 has got a pretty alright screen to me, though I am disappointed with the super dim screen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5814,"I can still accept it because I paid below 700 bucks for it, knowing very well that 700 bucks can only get me laptops with super low end specs in the Intel camp."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5814,"Anyway, I think it is likely you won't see AMD chips in high end models anytime soon."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5814,Intel made sure of that.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5815,so actually which ultrabook is good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5815,or we should not go them..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5815,just get those that are a tad bigger?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5816,Tbh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5816,Ultrabook usually will skimp somewhere just to make it thin and light.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5816,And usually it is the cooling department
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5816,cause it is the biggest.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5816,It is also design to throttle when it hit high temps.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5816,Usually people buy ultrabook
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5816,"is really for portability, the rest is just a bonus."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5816,To me my first notebook is from compaq.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5816,And those days a 14inch lappy is minimally 2.4kg.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5816,"Now even the E595 that i just bought, a 15inch is even lighter than the older ones."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5816,And i dont find 1.7kg heavy to even carry around anymore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5817,"Saving few hundred grams to sacrifice the number of ports,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5817,money n
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5817,reduced specs is definitely a no no for most.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5817,Sent from Rem Best Grill using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5818,It depends on what you are looking out for.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5818,"If it is portability, Ultrabook is an option."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5818,"If not Ultrabook, then you need to ask yourself what is an acceptable weight for you."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5818,"For performance, Ultrabook is certainly out of the question."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5818,"In my case, I have a laptop for work and in case I need to bring it out."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5818,"For heavy load, I leave it to my desktop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5818,"I am fine with a heavier laptop, i.e. over 2kg."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5818,"As long as I can use it comfortably and the battery life is decent, I am good."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5819,Actually I don't think this is true.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5819,"If there is no market for ultra portables, then most companies will not go through the trouble of creating and designing more Ultrabooks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5819,Think how well Apple is selling their Macbook Air and Macbooks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5819,and you get a sense.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5819,I do agree with you
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5819,I am no fan of being dependent on dongles for connectivity.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,4k screen wise.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,Don't get Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,Their 4k screens have a major issue with image retention.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,"After the circuit breaker, try this: go to a best denki etc store and on a Lenovo 4k laptop, open Microsoft Paint."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,Use the paint bucket to fill the background grey.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,"You will notice the desktop wallpaper ""burnt in"" as the background."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,"So far I saw this issue on Lenovo S940, C940 and S740 display sets."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,I had the S740
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,previously also and had dead pixel issues.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,"I think for Lenovo, stick with the Full HD 100% sRGB/72% NTSC screens."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,4k oled also
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,a no-no
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,because grey uniformity is like *
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,*
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,*
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,*
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5820,"...
Seems like phones these days have much higher quality screens than laptops"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5821,Btw ThinkPads used to have garbage screens.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5821,Now the situation is better alr.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5821,Just make sure you get the IPS with 72% NTSC/100% sRGB should be safe.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5821,Think now all the T and X series should be ok.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5822,I'm currentyly using an ultrabook.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5822,actually bought this because need to bring around.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5822,since now WFH seems like not so useful.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5822,didn't like it being hot
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5822,that's all when zooming.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5823,Basically like me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5823,I do simple basic tasks on my new ultrabook
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5823,but I still have a desktop for heavy duty things.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5823,There is actually a very huge demand for ultrabooks especially in the businesses.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5823,"For those who need a laptop to work, they usually provide ultrabooks for easy portability to those who need to bring it around."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5823,"my old ""ultrabook"" was 1.7kg.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5823,my new one is 1.28...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5823,the term stays the same.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5823,but its really getting lighter
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5824,That is true.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5824,"Back when Intel created this ""Ultrabook"", most slim laptops below 2kg can fall in the category."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5824,"Fast forward to recent couple of years, all the PC manufacturer is pulling an Apple, and going crazy making it light and slim."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5824,"I don't mind light and slim, but the quest for ever lighter and slimmer laptop needs to stop because it is becoming counter productive when it comes to performance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5824,"If this continues, I will just have to ditch having a laptop and use an iPad instead."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5824,I don't know if the PC makers know that an Intel processor is not an ARM chip sipping power.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5824,"Even the ULV series, power consumption can burst up to 25W, and the ultra slim laptop is going to be like a hot plate."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5825,The market wants Ultrabook as thin as possible for typing word documents.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5825,"If productivity is more important, look for T or X series with TDP set to 25w."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5826,For me I really like light and slim....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5826,"Back in 2012 when I first entered uni, I bought a 14 inch laptop which weighed a whopping 2.3kg and had poor batt life"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5826,so I ended up having to bring the power brick everywhere also and becoming a slave to an AC power source.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5826,"If it were today, I'll buy a 1.2kg laptop plus a USB-C power bank and everything will be under 2kg."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5826,"As for power, I think the current quad core processors are speedy enough for many tasks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5826,"Also don't forget, while we have thin and light laptops, there are still more powerful laptops available with 25w+ processors."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,Thats the problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,Going thinner and thinner and lighter
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,every gen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,It is something going to be not worth it anymore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,The performance really take a hit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,Is not how powerful it is.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,"Even if one put a 25w processor, it will throttle."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,And when it throttles the performance take a dip.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,Then comes to whats the point here for ultrabook?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,It is meant for light task and portability only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,"Anything more, with prolong heat of the processor is just gonna shorten the lifespan of it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,"Yes it may be light, with a lot of usb ports sacrificed, one has to spend more money again on dongles and extension ports."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,Another issue would be expansion of other memory modules.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,Most ultrabooks comes with embedded ram modules.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,"Ram is fine, all is good."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,When ram is faulty good luck.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,That leaves you to have only 1 Ram slot left.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,Sometimes i think like someone mentioned here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,Ultrabook is all good in terms of weight.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,But really susah when looking at the compromises.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,"To me, i stick with traditional laptops."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,Cause honestly i dont mind the extra 300-400g.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,"But i get overall better thermal performance, i get more useful ports, i get a better performing laptop that performs well enough for my photo and video apps."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5827,"If i truly want something that performs really well, a desktop is where i will go for."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5828,Just get P series for photo video app.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5829,where are the intel 10s reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5830,Depends on individual needs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5830,"1 group dun mind carrying heavy with full features ports, etc while another group prefers as light as possible."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5830,I belong to 2nd group.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5830,"I like to travel light for biz,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5830,a 13 inches laptop with weight of 1 kg and best with thunderbolt is more than enough.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5830,"I need my laptop for doc, ppt, xls, emails, youtube and other basic, maybe some games installed, like starcraft."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5830,My current 4 yrs
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5830,plus hp envy serves me well
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5830,but it is getting old and battery is gone.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5830,I am looking around for a light weight laptop and waiting to see what ryzen 4000s laptops around.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5831,ultrabooks are not what you want if u want performance for a laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5831,there are high perf laptops that give 45W processors with decent cooling.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5831,Albeit heavier than an ultrabook..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5831,different laptops have different purposes...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5831,"but as mentioned, an ultrabook suits me portable needs well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5832,Well I wouldn't say its a 'problem' but rather we have more choices these days.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5832,"Like you can still opt for a heavier, more powerful laptop if need be."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5832,In my case I am happy with my ultrabook for portable use.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5832,For heavy loads I use my desktop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5832,My only complaint is my office's Dell Latitude is very very laggy but
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5832,maybe because of my company bloatware on it lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5833,"If there's P1 with ryzen, that would be a buy for me"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5834,This is the problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5834,"Regardless of model/ series, the laptop is getting slimmer and lighter with each passing year."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5834,Even the DTR are slimmer and lighter based on my observation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5834,"As a result, many are barely able to keep the components cool, losing ports, or losing upgradeability"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5834,"i.e. the current T series comes with 1 soldered RAM, and only 1 to upgrade."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5835,I agree Ultrabooks are not for performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5835,"But noting that the components are getting more power hungry, yet the chassis for all laptops are getting slimmer, at some point performance is going to be badly capped."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5835,Chip makers have come up with creative ways to manage the heat by giving it boost capabilities if there is thermal legroom.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5835,But these are just bursty clockspeed bumps and generally don't sustain in any laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5835,A quick look at all the Intel/AMD chips of recent years and you can see the trend.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5835,Renoir seems to have bucked the trend somewhat even though they have a boost speed because the shrink to 7nm certainly helps thermally and able to sustain at a fairly high clockspeed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5836,Bloatware can't really be helped for an organization if it is for security reasons.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5836,I used to have a corporate laptop that takes a solid 10 mins to boot up because of the number of security apps that it needs to load.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5836,"That laptop uses an SSD by the way, and not some mechanical hard drive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5836,So you can imagine the number of bloatwares.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5837,Lol my wife t490 corp lappy really wols despite the ssd being used.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5837,The vpn the antivirus they used requires a lot of resources.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5838,There may a few security/ anti-virus being installed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5839,This is not a problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5839,Just because one person likes to eat Chinese food and not western food does not make him/her a problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5839,You can get a gaming laptop with 45w CPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5839,"I definitely prefer bringing out a 1.2kg ultrabook, a USB c cable and an adapter weighting less than 200g for my work."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5839,"If you need a sustained CPU power, you need a 45w processor"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5840,Is it not enough memory?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5841,I don't believe it is a memory issue anymore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5841,"While it only has 12GB of RAM, my old personal laptop only have 8GB and boots significantly faster."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5841,The problem is the security softwares are very resource heavy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5841,I suspect it is actually scanning before it loads.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5841,Otherwise I don't see why it takes that long to boot into a usable state.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5842,I think you are not getting what I said.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5842,I said it is not just an Ultrabook problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5842,"Look around you, all the laptops are losing weight and size."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5842,"Sure 45W laptops are bigger in size, but still compare it with 2 years ago, they definitely lost weight."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5842,This slimming exercise is not just limited to Ultrabook.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5842,"If you read any 45W laptop reviews, most of them can't sustain the supposed high clockspeed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5842,"I am not expecting it to run at full boost speed, but even at the base speed they struggle."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5842,"Power they certainly have enough, but cooling, no."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5842,"PC makers try to go around the problem but slapping more heatpipes, but that does not solve the problem of the small heatsink that are the bottleneck."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5843,"so probably if one is OK with standard NB non ultras and NOT desktop replacement , it might be better to get these  since they are now like say slightly more than 1.5kg"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5843,as compared to prev prev prev gen...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5844,"Hi guys, any laptop is worth to buy right now ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5844,Looking for a laptop that is light
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5844,and I dont have the habit of Gaming.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5844,Is Asus Zenbook 2020 a good choice at $1800?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5845,I owned 1st gen UX 21 before.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5845,Love it and easily carried around.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5845,Good pricing and portability.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5845,"No problem with it but as norm, battery failed after few yrs and good excuse to upgrade."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5845,"Currently, I am also looking at Zenbook 13 or 14 but holding back for 4000s."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5846,This series no longer worth it
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5846,You guys promoted this too much on hwz.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5846,Market spoilers
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5847,I would avoid the ZenBook for one simple reason -- it cannot charge through USB-C.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5847,I would try the Acer Swift 5 instead for the price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5847,"Or if you can wait, wait for the Renoir series or the upcoming refreshed HP Envy 13 which now has a Thunderbolt port and has much smaller footprint than before."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5848,whats going on?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5849,"Look, it is an Intel thing"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5849,When was the last time you see a laptop not throttle?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5849,You need to run on the Low power CPU like 5-10w in order for it not to throttle significantly due to huge heat created.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5849,"Intel 45w TDP and AMD 45w TDP are very different, with Ryzen much cooler."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5849,You can check the desktop parts you will know.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5849,"Well, wait for Ryzen 4000 45w APU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5849,Asus G14 is promising.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5850,That's because I have configured the highest priced screen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5850,"but I want a better screen still, and other brands don't have thinkpad keyboard."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5851,Anyone getting Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5 with Ryzen 7 4700U?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5851,There's a flash deal that just started on Lazada for 1 day only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5852,ME! been eyeing!@@@
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5853,I don't think there is official Lenovo warranty though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5853,But it's a good price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5853,Can someone buy and test whether 4k@60hz over DP works?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5853,Lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5854,this one right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5855,Yeah !
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5855,Indeed it's very tempting 🤣
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5856,Yup!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5856,Indeed tempting offer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5857,it is worth because base model 4500u and 1 year warranty is 1.4k
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5858,Base model is out in Singapore?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5859,Its a good deal to me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5859,I suspect it will cost more if you configure it over at Lenovo's site.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5859,I bought my Lenovo IdeaPad 5 from this seller just few weeks back as well after doing the same config on Lenovo's site.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5860,nope.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5860,compare with australia
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5861,"In addtion, the below points makes it even more enticing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5861,"1,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5861,"Ready stock, Ship out by today, express delivery 1~2 dayslatest by 14 May.
2, Lenovo Brand Fair 4-31 May 2020，5 series and above Free MS Office 2019 permanent license"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5861,I do want to caution that the RAM in this case is likely soldered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5861,"So there may be no option to upgrade, in case you are thinking of getting more RAM."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5862,"I think because there is no sale now, Lenovo jacked up the prices of all their products significantly."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5862,"Recently went to check the E495, and the base spec is already over 1.1K SGD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5863,I get the point about the ThinkPad keyboard.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5863,"At least in terms of priority, I will certainly take a better screen if I can find it elsewhere, and settle for a lesser keyboard."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5863,"I type quite a lot as well, but I can adapt."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5863,"Because I use the screen all the time when using a laptop, I think it will be my priority."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5864,Pulled the trigger and gotten it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5864,Actually i'm more gian about the express delivery than the microsoft office
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5864,Will post more update once it arrives
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5865,Very tempting to get the Lenovo as well
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5865,but quite surprised they still using the barrel plug
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5865,saw that it can charge over the USB C as well
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5865,but anyone know how many watts it'll take?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5865,I have 65W and Apple 87W charger.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5866,But is it safe to purchase from themInfinito
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5866,ATRiX ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5866,Did a google on the brand and came across several complaints about Atrix Dynamics.. do they belong to the same company such that they simply changed name ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5867,"Just pulled the trigger, can't wait to receive and test it out."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5868,"If i'm taking my previous laptop Asus Zephyrus GU502 USB-C PD Specs, You will be able to use Apple 87W USB C Charger, however max wattage pull would only be 65W."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5869,don't pofma me..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5869,is this lenovo occifer stock?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5869,this lcd isit good?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5870,Hi dear~confirm 100% sRGB and 3Years
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5870,Lenovo onsite warranty
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5871,If 100% sRGB it's quite a good buy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5871,"Only two points worth noting:
- output possibly restricted to 4K@30HZ going by"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5871,psref
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5871,- restricted to usb 3.0 gen 1.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5871,I have a gen 2 SSD which might be bottlenecked by this.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5871,But ok for the price
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5871,"it's a really good deal, company name notwithstanding."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5871,I might wait for the T14 AMD instead.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5871,That one will have 2 usb c gen2 ports with displayport 1.4 and hdmi 2.0...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5872,"Ask the staff inside lo, if the specs are true will be quite worth"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5872,Sent from Rem Is Best Waifu using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5873,I think it's Lenovo official stock.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5873,"I checked the model number to the psref, it's a Singapore model."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5873,For some reason the psref was removed but Google cache still has a copy of it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5873,Unfortunately it's impossible to check whether really 100% srgb
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5874,The AU website listed HDMI 1.4 and color gamut
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5874,45%i assume this is NTSC for this model.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5874,Is the lazada using a different panel?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5875,If you look at the psref website there is a version with 100% sRGB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5875,short of using a colorimeter on the actual unit
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5875,it's impossible to verify since both are full HD IPS
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5875,300 nits lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5875,Hdmi 1.4 will mean only 4k@30hz really a pity because all Ryzen igpus support hdmi 2.0.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5875,But I'm more curious whether the limitation also applies over displayport.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5876,I saw them listed as an authorised reseller on Lenovo's FB:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5876,So... seems ok?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5877,Very interesting indeed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5877,After looking at all the amd skus for both 15w and high powered 35-45w sku.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5877,Intel need to really buck up liao lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5877,Even the upcoming r5 is a hexa core.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5877,Really wonder how the i5 i7 quad cores gonna sell lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5878,"Looking at the Intel counterpart, it has the option for 100% sRGB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5878,so it might be true?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5878,"14"" FHD 1920"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5878,"x 1080 IPS, 300 nits, sRGB 100% Metal SKUs only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5878,14
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5878,""" FHD 1920 x 1080 IPS, 300 nits, 45%"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5878,NTSC.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5878,"14"" FHD 1920 x 1080 TN, 250 nits,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5878,45% NTSC.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5878,"14"" HD 1366 x 768 TN, 220 nits, 45% NTSC"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5879,I just checked with someone who has the 15 inch model.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5879,The USB-C port supports 4k@60hz@10-bit
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5879,so I assume it should be a normal DP 1.4 pass through which is good news!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5879,Hopefully the 14 inch is the same.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5879,I just ordered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5879,Apparently there's an additional 50 off if you follow the shop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5879,"Tbh I think atrix doesn't have the best of reputation, but let's see how it goes."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5879,I'll test to see whether 100% sRGB claim is true.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5879,Probably will sell once the T14 AMD comes out
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5879,but I guess it should retain its value well?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5880,Yes but metal SKU only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5880,The AMD SKU they are selling is the aluminium + plastic SKU
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5880,but then the screen selection across different SKUs may be different.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5881,U able to use the $50 off ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5881,the shop told me not applicable to the purchase
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5882,"Didn't know about the additional 50 off,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5882,"oh well, still a good deal, please update us whether its really 100% sRGB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5882,I also ordered one but got no device to test the screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5883,For my case I wasn't able to apply that $50 by following the shop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5883,Let's wait for the laptop to be shipped out
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5884,"Can leh, it applied for me automatically on checkout."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5884,Hope this laptop retains its resale value for 1 mth or so before T14 AMD is released or the Envy x360 AMD...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5884,Haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5885,well.. no choice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5886,Got a lousy screen but good for general work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5887,"Guys better read more reviews first, I have read 2 reviews already, they said sRGB is only 40 plus only just like the Acer Ryzen 4000"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5888,HDMI version 1.4 can support 4K@60.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5888,2 x USB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5888,3.1 Gen 1 1 x always-on
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5888,1 x USB 3.1 Type-C Gen 1 DP + power delivery
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5888,1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5888,"x HDMI 1.4b
1"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5888,x SD card reader.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5888,1 x combo audio/mic jack
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5889,"The 40 plus is based on NTSC, so sRGB should be around 50-60s."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5889,"Then again, the T series from yesteryear and the E series that everyone is raving about here also comes with this lousy screen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5889,Based on the.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5889,"for this model, there is an SKU with 100% sRGB, so there is a slim chance that they are right."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5889,But I don't think resale value will be affected much based on this fact ba...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5889,"Everytime those stupid Carousellers try to lowball because it's an ""i5"" and not i7..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5889,don't think they care about display as long as WOW OCTA CORE 16GB RAM
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5890,4k@60Hz only at 4:2:0 which is chroma subsampling.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5890,Which means the colour resolution will be halved.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5890,"Why are we still on HDMI 1.4, you ask?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5890,"Because prior to Ice Lake, the iGPUs on Intel processors support only up to HDMI 1.4 or DisplayPort 1.2."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5890,But the thing is Ryzen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5890,iGPUs
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5890,support HDMI 2.0 all along
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5890,"you can compare the spec of T490 vs T495 for example, but Lenovo for some reason is choosing to cut costs here."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5891,do help to review the laptop once you've received.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5892,yes so many reviews I read point to subpar screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5893,wha...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5893,local..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5893,than why lenovo sg don't have yet
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5894,want to clear unsold 3500u chips
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5895,Where do you guys find the review ah?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5895,"But their naming of their laptops quite funny, Ideapad slim 5"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5895,", some show 15.6"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5895,""" some show 14""."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5895,Some total remove the word slim from the branding
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5895,But price : performance ratio cannot hiam
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5896,give promotion.. under 800 sure all sapu!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5897,by the way romania seems to have the S540-13ARE
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5897,but I cannot find this laptop anywhere else on the internet
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5897,lol:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5897,Specs seem pretty good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5897,QHD + 100% sRGB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5897,and in 13 inch form factor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5897,Dual USB-C Gen 2 and has IR sensor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5897,Btw just realised the IdeaPad 5 which Atrix is selling has no fingerprint sensor
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5898,The monitor that came with my IdeaPad 5 14IIL is from BOE.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5898,Can't measure the color accuracy since I don't have the necessary tools.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5898,Update:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5898,The specs mentioned 100% sRGB for this BOE monitor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5899,DId they confirm?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5899,The reason why I am asking is because they said the same about the IdeaPad 5 that I purchased from them 2 weeks ago.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5899,"But when the product came, there's fingerprint sensor on the power switch that works."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5899,I even wrote that in my review.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5899,Do ask them to reconfirm because it is not written on the specs found on the box.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5899,So they may not be 100% sure.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5900,I think it does have the fingerprint sensor as standard.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5901,"IdeaPad 5 have 2 sizes, which is normally mentioned in the name."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5901,Not too sure what the slim means when the seller mentioned the weight being around 1.5KG.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5901,"The model that I have running an Intel processor is also IdeaPad 5, and also 1.5KG."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5902,Did you check the minimal purchase amount?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5902,I recall it was 50 off 1600.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5902,"If so, then that is the reason why it did not apply."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5902,"If you collected the Atrix couple during the weekend sale, you should have 20 bucks off."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5903,"Because in the US they have this model called Ideapad Slim 7, so i assume there will be similar model with ""5"" in it"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5903,But it looks more premium as compared to ideapad 5 AMD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5904,I went to Google the SKU configuration 81YM005DSB it got removed from Lenovo's website from Google still has a cache:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5904,Shows here no fingerprint reader.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5904,"Btw, yours is which IdeaPad 5 model?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5904,What is the model of the BOE display?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5905,"The $50 is applicable, I have to unfollow and follow again on the Lazada app from my phone for the coupon to pop up on the screen to claim."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5905,Then when check out it will auto apply the coupon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5906,"Actually now you talk about it, i realize mine got deducted the $50 right before i paid."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5906,"My mistake, saw wrongly"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5907,The model number says IdeaPad 5 14IIL05.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5907,Model number I think is 81YH007BSB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5907,"As for the model of the display, I only checked the device manager hardware ID, which returned the value, BOE08D7."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5907,"I tried looking up for this, but found no information on it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5908,You can't compare the 5 and the 7 series since they are different class.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5908,"Generally, the IdeaPad should start with 3 as the lower end model and 7 being the top end model."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5908,They added another S145 which I think is lower end than the 3 series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5909,"If you can, can you download HWINFO which should show the full model name of the display?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5909,Btw noted yours have a beefier 57wh battery as well the one atrix is selling is 45wh only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5909,How is the battery life on the Intel model?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5910,In Singapore its called the Yoga Slim 7.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5910,I was waiting for it to be launched actually.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5910,The Intel version was on the Lenovo store for a few weeks but mysteriously disappeared.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5910,I heard the Intel version got recalled for some issue or something.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5910,You cant find any review anywhere.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5910,Lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5910,The Slim 7 is not very light too...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5910,Around 1.5kg.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5910,I really miss the older IdeaPad 720s and s730 which were very portable and lightweight.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5910,Assuming the Ideapad 5 really has
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5910,"a 100% sRGB screen the only difference would be build materials, usb 3.1 Gen2/tb3 and hdmi2.0."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5910,Honestly I more curious waiting to see how much the T14 AMD will cost.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5910,"If the t495 is any indication, should be around 2k for a high end config with 16gb and 1tb ssd."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5910,Still cheaper than dell XPS or macbook
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5911,"Well if it doesnt have the 100% sRGB screen like the seller mentioned, I think can return the product since they gave wrong information."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5912,"Ahhh i see, but"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5912,so far hows the build quality at least for your Ideapad 5 ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5912,"For the base which uses ABS, does it feel flimsy / warp easily with just alittle force."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5912,"First time getting Lenovo laptop, so not too sure about its build quality for their lower end models."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5912,Much appreciated !
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5912,"Hahahah actually everyone is fine with this model, but the million dollar question is still about the 100% sRGB screen !"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5912,The performance definitely on par / wins the dell XPS 13.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5913,Build quality is decent.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5913,In fact it is a step up from my ThinkPad E485 which is really the entry level ThinkPad model.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5913,"The base is plastic, but feels sturdy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5913,The keyboard feels very nice to type on.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5913,No complain on the build.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5913,"My main complain is on the Samsung SSD PM991 being used on this laptop because it is the smaller 2242 form factor used, it runs really really hot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5913,"In games and for about 10 mins, it hit 74 degs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5913,"When running an anti virus scan, it heats up to 81 degs and throttled to keep the SSD running at 75 to 76 degs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5913,"In comparison, the WD Black that I was using in my E485 that I upgraded ran mostly at 60ish degs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5913,"The SSD on the IdeaPad has got a warranty sticker on it, so I am thinking if I can change it without voiding warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5913,Not sure if anyone knows?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5913,"I know for Acer, you can break the warranty seal, and as long as you don't damage anything, warranty will still be valid."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5914,I think you need to be careful here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5914,I've ever got my return rejected by seller despite the fact that they confirmed a feature that was not found in the product.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5914,"And its a local LazMall seller, and not some unknown Chinese seller."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5914,"The moment you opened the item, the odds of return is greatly diminished."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5914,"In this case, it can be quite difficult to ascertain if it is a 100% sRGB screen without trained eyes or proper equipments."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5914,"Lenovo multi source their display, so"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5914,"unless otherwise specified, there is always a chance you get the poorer quality screen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5915,Maybe the Yoga bend too much that it broke.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5915,"Anyway, I suspect the cost of ThinkPad T series with AMD will not be as cheap as it was before."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5915,"Previously regardless of Ryzen 5 or 7, you get standard 4 cores."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5915,"Now with a higher core count with the higher end models, the laptop cost is likely to increase."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5915,Which is why I feel this IdeaPad 5 is pretty decently priced.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5916,I think it also depends how AMD prices it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5916,"I see overseas pricing for Envy x360, Swift 3 and IdeaPad 5, price difference is only about 100 USD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5916,Not sure if it's wise for me to buy this just to play around...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5916,Maybe I should cancel my order
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5916,Btw whoever wants to calibrate their display...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5916,I can probably lend my calibrator to you for a nominal fee.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5916,After CB of course.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5917,not lazmall cannot return
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5918,"I see, thanks for the info, fingers crossed if its really a 100% sRGB screen like they mentioned but if its not, I might just sell it after a few months of usage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5919,"Don't rush to buy bah, wait for the thinkpad versions to come out than see."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5920,Btw someone on Carousell is doing preorder for Acer Swift 3 China sets.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5920,"4700U 16gb 1tb SSD for 1,300."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5920,Swift 3
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5920,no need to guess
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5920,", it's"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5920,*
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5920,*
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5920,** display.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5920,But has usb 3 gen 2 and hdmi 2.0
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5921,1.3K for China set is not worth it
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5921,I feel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5921,The display is not good even though its an IPS screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5921,I think Anandtech and Tomshardware have already reviewed it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5922,"Well... I was camping for this particular model, waiting for the flash sales price to release.. and the moment the clock strike 12 am, I am super delighted to see the price is marked down to 1298!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5922,However when I tried to collect the $50 follower voucher by following the store.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5922,there is no pop-up window to collect the $50 voucher.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5922,I even PM
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5922,the shop at that point in time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5922,only to receive a reply at 12 pm stating that this $50 dollars voucher doesn't apply to this flash sales price Which we all know is not true.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5922,"So after placing the order without using the voucher, I randomly went to try to unfollow and follow the shop and the pop-up window"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5922,appear for me to collect the $50 voucher!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5922,so I cancelled the order and re-ordered with the voucher
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5922,But I am praying hard  and hope that the seller doesn't do anything to my sealed laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5923,u missed the previous promo actually...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5923,I bought.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5923,3500u
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5923,512 ssd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5923,16gb ram.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5923,1080p
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5923,300 nits monitor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5923,total 1.3k nia
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5924,Which model is this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5925,didn't miss..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5925,i got a similar config
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5925,"also, was even cheaper"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5925,what model was yrs?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5926,thinkpad x395
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5927,I have the Slim 5 sitting in the Lazada cart now while I mull over whether to get it ^^
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5928,i see...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5928,my was a t495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5929,"if I were you , I'd wait for ppl who bot it and see their review"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5930,Just wait for the lenovo sg to come out with customize option
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5931,I wanted the light weight..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5931,If not I also will go
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5931,T series lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5932,"I mean if you need it, then I see no reason to hold back."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5932,"I actually feel for the specs, extended onsite warranty and free gifts, its a really good deal."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5933,T495 panel with 400 nits has got a high 98.6% sRGB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5933,"Refer to the
."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5934,Yup.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5934,But few gens back
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5934,the t series also had crappy screens
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5935,Good to know.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5935,"Similar to my observations, I feel the IdeaPad 5 build is quite good for its price."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5935,"As to the performance of the 4700U, the ability to maintain a higher clockspeed is as expected."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5935,Good for those looking for high CPU performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5936,"Hi all, I made the purchase!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5936,Excited as the Lenovo laptop will be my first laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5937,Have fun man.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5937,"If I did not buy my laptop 2 weeks back, I would have gotten this."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5937,Got tired waiting for Renoir based laptops.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5937,May consider getting a desktop Renoir instead for my HTPC if the pricing is attractive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5938,Haha just came to the realisation that my Renoir laotop may potentially be faster than my desktop???
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5938,Bought i5-6600k
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5938,"a few years back, just before AMD struck back"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5939,It just goes to show how much improvements AMD brought to the PC space.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5939,"While Intel was happily selling us expensive 2 and 4 core chips for more than a decade, AMD came in about 3 years back and PC became exciting again."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5939,Even hardcore Intel fans should thank AMD for more affordable and powerful Intel chips.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5939,Competition is good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5940,"No leh, I hate AMD, now need to upgrade more often"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5940,Thought my desktop can last 8 years last time hahahahahah
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5941,By the way anyone orders shipped out alr?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5941,Mine still packing stage...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5942,time to upgrade desktop also.......
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5943,"Ya same still packing... chatted with them, they said will start to ship today and expect 3-5 days to receive"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5943,.. thought their listing said 1-2 days
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5944,You still have the choice not to upgrade man.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5945,"Eh, I thought it said same day delivery"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5945,or did I remember wrongly?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5945,"For this model, I know they also have a caveat that buyer could receive on 18th May or something like that."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5946,"No same day delivery, only 'express delivery' within 1 - 2 days and latest and receive by 14 May."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5947,Yeah
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5947,but I think that faq was posted when the listing appeared last week
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5947,lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5948,My status has changed to 'Your package has been packed and is ready to be shipped to you'.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5948,So we'll see.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5949,Means you need to wait for NinjaVan to pick up and deliver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5950,Best case scenario
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5950,"it comes either tomorrow or Friday, won't be surprise if it comes on Saturday."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5951,"that's why for the past 10 years, there was no such thing as ""CPU bottleneck"" coz intel never improved."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5951,now AMD came and intel needs to wake up or die... and they are rushing 10nm coz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5951,they were too slow on 14nm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5951,"also, I don't need to keep changing motherboards when I  change processor for AMD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5951,I need to for intel
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5952,Ordered 3 weeks back..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5952,Still have not shipped...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5952,Sigh...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5953,"okay la, T series not bad quite lightweight also"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5954,great.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5954,waiting for thinkpad!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5954,can't come sooner!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5955,Okay just checked with the seller...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5955,ETA tomorrow
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5956,Asked the CSO of lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5956,Tentatively is 2nd week of June for the new T series
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5956,so i guess inline with the launch in NA?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5957,That's great!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5957,But then need to wait another month for it to reach sg after ordering?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5958,"My guess is they already building up inventory, so the time after ordering should not be too long, hard to say with the covid19 now"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5958,though
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5958,i see some of the drivers got support for the new thinkpads since April
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5959,I think it is possible if demand is high.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5959,"As per my questio to Atrix computer about the 15 inch IdeaPad 5, they responded to say due to shortage of Renoir chips, 15 inch model will only be out in July."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5959,"If that is true, and based on observations on the availability of Renoir laptops 1.5 months after AMD officially announced and released in March, I think there is indeed a shortage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5959,I think to some extend the supply disruption will also affect the PC makers in releasing new laptops as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5960,"I just receive a GrabExpress delivery notification coming from a shop in Sim Lim Square, it seems like my laptop is coming soon?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5960,Will update.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5961,whoa whoa!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5961,do review and give some photos!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5962,Lucky you...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5962,"Mine is ninjavan, surely very slow"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5963,Wah I also received grabexpress delivery notification
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5963,omg
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5964,"Seems like they are mass sending out the laptops, just received a notification as well !"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5965,"Just receive an image on GrabExpress of my item, seems like they just put it in a plastic bag without even wrapping it :"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5965,s22
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5965,My ETA is 25 mins but definitely will be more than that.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5966,Driver is 4 mins away
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5966,wow.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5966,Hopefully can play with it tonight and test sRGB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5967,"Looking forward to your test, according to the picture i receive, the sticker specs on the box doesn't say anything about 100% sRGB, so I'm still a skeptic on this."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5967,"My ETA has changed to 35 mins,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5967,oh wells..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5968,Seems like they changed the delivery partner to Grab.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5968,Good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5968,NinjaVan offers same days delivery too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5968,I ordered my laptop from Atrix at 2.45pm and got it around 4+ on the same day.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5969,Just received mine laptop!!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5969,the delivery uncle told me the seller paid delivery fee - $18 + $4 parking fee..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5970,Huh?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5970,Need pay the delivery fee meh?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5971,Huh why do you need to pay ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5971,Mine was via GrabExpress
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5971,never request me to pay
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5972,"Paiseh, I mean the seller paid $22 just for sending the stuff to us!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5973,"Enjoy guys, mine still far out, think i'll receive by 8PM?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5974,review review
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5975,Don't know where am i really getting my lappy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5975,"Ordered my T495S in late April, ETA 4 weeks so should be late May receive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5975,"Last week, received an email saying will have a slight delay, change to ship out in late May, receive on 4th June."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5975,Just now received another email saying that it will be shipped out next week.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5976,pls help review throttling
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5977,Does anyone think its worth to buy x1 carbon gen 7?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5978,what laptop u all buy sia?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5979,Total damage: $1248 after Using $50 voucher on the $1298 flash sales
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5980,Did you all receive a wireless mouse?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5980,"I got the laptop bag, wondering if there's supposed to be a mouse too?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5981,"First impression, display seems dim and washed out."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5981,Most probably not 100% sRGB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5981,but will do a test just to be sure.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5982,I didnt.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5982,Dont think there will be either
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5983,"Other first impressions - adapter doesn't have ground pin so if you touch the aluminium lid you can feel ""current"" running through."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5983,No fingerprint reader.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5983,"The plastic base has the rough coating, think similar to the E485"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5983,I had briefly last time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5983,Laptop is thicc and heavy compared to my XPS 13
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5984,"Just received mine, I'm not using the barrel plug they gave, instead I'm charging with a Ugreen 65w USB-C charger."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5984,No issues.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5984,Quite dissapointed ours doesn't have the fingerprint sensor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5984,Display does look abit dull to my eyes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5985,"Display wise with just naked eyes, already don't seems to be 100% sRGB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5985,and it's Abit washout.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5985,But definitely better than some laptop I own before.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5985,"I recommend anyone who owns this laptop, just grab a uGreen USB C charger"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5985,65W. Cost around 20+ and easily available on Lazada !
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5985,"Build quality better than expected, of course if you compare with high end laptops the difference is skyhigh."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5985,But the performance is able to compensate the cons 😁😁
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5986,By the way I have just checked the warranty online..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5986,it stated 2 years warranty instead of
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5986,3.. seller told me present invoice will do 😅
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5987,Just completed the calibration:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5987,"57.9% sRGB, 40.1% Adobe RGB and 41.2% DCI-P3."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5987,Quite a stark difference since I'm used to 100% sRGB screens
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5987,; my main monitor has 95% DCI-P3 lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5987,The anti-glare coating on the screen also seems a bit extreme
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5987,Not sure if I should do a refund.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5987,Currently I am awaiting refund of my XPS 13.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5987,"If approved, then it means I might be without laptop for the next two months before T14 AMD is released lol."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5988,"Wah I hate this ""Present Invoice"" reasoning, by then my invoice would have already been disintegrate"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5988,Or I totally forget about it 🤣
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5989,Its not on the power button?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5989,The rough coating around the keyboard is deliberate and feels quite nice to me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5989,Cant
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5989,compare the 3 devices man.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5989,One cost significantly more than the other.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5990,Just take a picture or scan the receipt and store it somewhere.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5990,I normally save them on my cloud drive after naming it in a way you can easily identify.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5991,Yep using the 65W Ugreen charger.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5991,"I agree the screen although not 100% sRGB, its better then my previous E490 and other laptops beside my Macbook Pro but its decent enough for me, think I can live with it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5991,Besides that the build quality is decent.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5991,"For the price I paid, I have no major major complains."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5991,Yeah notice that too...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5992,What is the display model?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5993,Refund through Lazada ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5993,"Maybe you can try luck, but quite disappointed when they mention it's 100% sRGB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5993,"but turns out it's 1/2 of it 🤣,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5993,but so far performance wise
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5993,I'm really happy about it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5993,Video rendering speed is better than what I expected for the cost :
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5993,performance ratio
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5994,"quite expected one la, the specs is damn good for its price liao."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5994,got test the ssd speed?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5995,I think those who really want the 100% sRGB screens need to look for the Intel counterpart or wait for the ThinkPad series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5995,"Overall happy with the purchase, luckily paid only 1298 instead of the now 1498."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5995,Anyone planning to upgrade storage to 1TB?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5996,"congrats bro...
how to test the nits?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5997,Congrats bro!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5997,YouHeypiCanLiao
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,Quick test on CrystalDiskMark:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,2300MB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,/s read
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,but about 1300MB/s write.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,"SD card reader is only UHS-1, so speed up to 80MB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,/
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,s only my card should be able to read around 250MB/s.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,USB-C port only up to Gen 1 speed as expected.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,DisplayPort over USB-C can output 4k@60Hz.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,"But it seems like a DisplayPort 1.2 port only, no DP 1.4 even though the GPU supports it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,"Means to say, max you can connect one 4K display @"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,60Hz.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,I will probably keep the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,It's fine for normal use I guess
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,haha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,Lightroom editing all those...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5998,I think mai hiam buay pai la.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5999,"I am going to use this on the go as my Lightroom and Premiere Pro machine, I'm not a professional"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5999,"so I don't really mind, as long as I happy with my edits"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,5999,I'm fine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6000,Atrix offered to refund no questions asked after I mentioned that it's not 100% sRGB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6000,and they say can come and collect tomorrow.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6000,they claimed Lenovo gave them the wrong specs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6000,A bit undecided.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6000,Maybe I need to play around more with the laptop first
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6000,haha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6000,"But I must say, given their ""reputation"" in the past I am pleasantly surprised at their good aftersales support."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6001,Hmmm... interesting...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6002,Heng ah.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6002,I tot really 100% sRGB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6002,Almost pull the trigger.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6002,I think i will just wait for the asus zephyrus 14/15 to be readily available then buy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6002,Or perhaps if i choose not to game then i will wait for thinkpad to arrive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6003,can test when the throttling will kick in?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6003,i.e you zoom
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6003,=+ surf net + youtube..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,"On the bright side, my recent laptops with 100%+ sRGB had issues with colour tints, dead pixels, backlight bleeding, etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,No such issue on this laptop as far as I can tell so far.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,"Installed BatteryBar and discharge rate is only 5,221mW while writing this post."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,Estimated battery life is 7 hours despite the small 47Wh battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,"I remember the last time I bought AMD E485 when this thread first started, lol, I could barely get 3 hours because of high idle drain"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,"I remember it was usually around 13,000mW."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,Now AMD laptops seem to have little compromise.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,Weighed this laptop on the Xiaomi weighing scale.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,Weighs 1.4kg exactly vs 1.15 kg for my Dell XPS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,Display panel is AUO B140HAN04.E. Panel details here:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,Using the display makes me feel a little bit...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,red colour blind haha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,The red colours are really muted.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,HWInfo shows memory is running in dual channel mode.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,Going to run some benchmarks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,3DMark...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6004,what else should I run?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6005,"By the way, I realise when I plug in my 3.5mm IEMs into the laptop, while the mic and speaker works, I cannot use the play/pause buttons or the volume up/down."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6005,Can anyone who has the laptop test this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6006,Have to see the ear piece build in feature whether it supports anot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6006,Some earpiece supports iOS only or Android Only or Multiple devices.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6006,So you can check your earpiece whether it supports PC .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6007,thanks for the information!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6007,looks like have to wait for the thinkpads to get a good screen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6008,The earpiece works with my XPS though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6008,Wondering if it's a proprietary feature.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6008,Maybe Lenovo doesn't support it
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6009,"These are fairly light load, so I am not expecting it to throttle since it may not even be running at an all core boost."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6010,Use an external monitor for those who need good sRGB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6011,"Actually since they did not specify on the spec sheet, I was a doubtful as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6011,"When I got the Intel version of the IdeaPad 5, it did mention that its 300 nits 100% sRGB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6011,However there's backlight bleeding with this BOE panel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6012,if you download HWINFO you should be able to see a more detailed model number.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6012,From there can look at the specs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6012,Oh which part said it's 100% sRGB?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6012,that's interesting to know
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6013,I talked to the CS about returning the item and getting the Intel version instead as in the Intel Ideadpad 5 listing they clearly put it 100% sRGB monitor but the CS replied saying their Intel version not using the 100% sRGB screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6013,So whack
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6014,Just ran some benchmarks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6014,Performance is good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6014,"Cinebench R20 2891 max, 2423"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6014,min after 5 runs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6014,I guess there is some thermal throttling
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6014,but nothing too severe.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6014,3dmark sky diver score - 12000 on physics test
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6015,Which listing you saw ah?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6016,I checked yesterday on HWInfo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6016,It only mentioned unknown monitor with the model BOE08D7.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6016,sRGB is mentioned on the Atrix Lazadas page.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6017,"If you still keep the box, does it show 100% sRGB at the spec at the side?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6017,HWINFO
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6017,"there should be two ""Monitor name"" fields."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6017,There is nothing shown on the second field?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6017,Usually there should be another model number shown there one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6017,Can you screenshot?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6017,"Also, which model did you get?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6017,I5-1035g1 with 1tb?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6017,Do you feel the colours on the laptop is vibrant?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6017,Or muted?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6018,Are you returning yours?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6019,We cannot expect 100% sRGB with such prices.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6019,They should have done a higher price version with better display.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6020,"When you expand the monitor settings, do you see something like this highlighted on the right?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6020,E.g. mine also shows Unknown monitor
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6020,AUO408D
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6020,but when you expand you can see the model is actually
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6020,B140HAN04.E
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6020,If it turns out to be
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6020,100% sRGB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6020,I think I'm gonna return it and change it for the Intel version...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6020,haha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6021,"This is the model,
BOE CQ NV140FHM-N4V"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6021,"I can't find information specific to this ending with N4V. Some of the 14 inch monitors ending with N4 are 250, and some 300 nits."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6021,Nothing mentioned about the colors though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6021,It does say that it is an 8bit panel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6021,The model I got is what you mentioned but with the 512GB storage option.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6021,Color wise
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6021,", I think it is better than the IPS on my E485."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6022,Nothing mentioned on monitor quality on the label.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6022,It only says 14 FHD IPS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6023,The IdeaPad 5 with Intel processor comes with a 100% sRGB monitor as per the spec sheet that Atrix provided.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6023,I have no way to validate it though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6023,It cost the same as the IdeaPad 5 that comes with the Renoir chip.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6023,"I actually don't think it is impossible, rather they purposely gimp the AMD version as usual."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6024,"I managed to dig out this website in Korean:
If you translate it and see the comments, he is using the BOE CQ NV140FHM-N4V as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6024,"65% sRGB -- so slightly better than the 58% we have here, but far from 100% sRGB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6025,So I think it is a Lenovo issue since this is quite off specs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6025,Not sure if any calibration can make this better though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6025,I am sure these panels are not calibrated.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6026,"Anyway, I think previous Lenovo laptop seem to also use BOE panel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6027,"Nah, I'll be keeping mine, so far everything is good albeit the screen"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6027,but I can live with it since I've seen worse.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6028,Probably their marketing team dunno the specs and anyhow.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6028,"After all, both are IPS 300 nits panels."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6028,I can't seem to make the reds redder on my unit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6028,"On the bright side literally, the display is actually quite bright measured 360 nits so at full brightness it looks quite ok still."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6029,You tried upping the saturation abit in the AMD software?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6029,Not the perfect solution but abit better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6029,"Those that have colorimeter, tried calibrating the display?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6030,Calibration won't help much on small gamut displays and may make things worst actually.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6030,Actually I'm not sure the issue is due to contrast or colour gamut?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6030,Anyway I will keep the laptop ba since the Intel version is also not 100% srgb
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6031,"Actually after all these measurements to show that these are not sRGB, I am starting to doubt if the supposed 100% sRGB monitor options on Lenovo's site are accurate."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6031,Most people won't measure the display since these requires some special equipments.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6032,Waiting for next month see how's the price for t n e series first.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6032,Sent from Rem Best Grill using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6033,Should be accurate if it is specifically stated as such and no other similar config.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6033,Example is the Yoga Slim 7 which only has 100% sRGB options.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6033,Here it is silent but someone
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6033,dunno is it
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6033,Lenovo or the retailer went to act smart and assume it's the full sRGB one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6034,"Actually after i adjust abit of the saturation via the AMD radeon settings, the color seems to be richer and same as my current monitor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6034,"I know its a cheat way, but at least visually it looks nice"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6035,I think will be good to have someone to test it out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6035,Lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6035,I have very little confidence with them now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6036,So far their 7 and 9 series all use higher end screens ba.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6036,Should be ok lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6037,Btw anyone managed to activate the free office?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6038,"If I am not mistaken, there should be a Lenovo seal on the screw holding the SSD down."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6038,"Till now, I am not certain if it is fine to remove it without voiding warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6038,"It is meant to prevent tampering, but question is if this is to prevent end users like us or the sellers from tampering."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6039,Is it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6039,"Last when I upgraded my E490, there was no such seal."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6039,I can't open the back yet as I don't have the right screws for it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6040,these days opening rear panel is quite normal and common..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6041,Well theres a lenovo seal on the default 512 NVMe.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6041,"But i didnt expect to have another slot, so gonna slot it another stick of 1TB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6042,Eh where you see the other slot?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6043,Awesome find!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6043,Will save me the hassle when moving OS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6044,I didn't have any lenovo seal on the SSD screw on my E495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6045,The slot that my EVO 970 is in !
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6046,"nice sia, can put 2 mvme ssd inside"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6047,After slotting in this 1TB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6047,This could actually be an actual workstation capable laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6047,Less the screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6047,"I would say, this laptop is one of my greater buys"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6048,wa.. 2 slots nice..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6048,I think my x395 only got 1 lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6049,"Oh ya forgot to mention, you guys have to self source your own screws to secure the NVMe."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6049,"Just nice i have an external enclosure, so i just used it to secure in the slot as the mounting hall is standard for all NVMe"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6049,Regardless its internal or external
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6050,"Out of curiosity, I went to look up the FRUs available for LCD:"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6050,FRU BO NV140FHM-N66 V8.0 FHDI AG and its two substitutes seem like the 72% NTSC models.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6050,"The process for replacing the screen seems quite tedious though, but a quick search on the internet shows that screen is available for purchase for like US$60."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6050,Very tempted to purchase and see if like PC Dreams or someone could help me to replace the screen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6051,"Btw, which screwdriver to remove the casing?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6051,Any Torx T5 will do?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6051,This thread should be renamed to AMD Ryzen Laptops Thread
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6051,haha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6052,Yup !
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6052,thats what i used
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6052,", Torx screw should be pretty standard."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6052,Used it to dismantle macbook as well
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6053,Actually i'm more interested in getting a bigger battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6054,"Looking at the screen area, looks hard to remove the display, I used to replace my X250 screen from a 1366x768 screen to a FHD IPS, it was an easy swap."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6054,Not sure about this though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6055,Whoever wants to dismantle this model Should be similar to intel :
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6056,ya Sia.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6056,I thought can just replace the whole panel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6056,But need to remove the bezels and all wth...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6056,Ooo replacing battery sounds like a good idea!!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6056,But where to source for the original 57wh batt ah?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6057,"Nice find, very useful."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6057,The X250 LCD replacement also need to remove the bezel but it was very easy since you can just 'pop' them off and no need remove the whole top.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6057,EDIT:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6057,"Just saw the video, the LCD is also hold on by tape, even more tedious."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6058,battery might have bios whitelist so third party cannot charge
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6059,ATRiX removed the 100% SRGB spec from the Lazada page.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6060,Where can we buy the screws if any of us plan to upgrade the storage ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6060,Haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6061,Maybe your motherboard has it if you have a mobo that supports NVME storage?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6062,bro you really hardcore
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6063,I see.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6063,"For the Intel version, the CPU is sitting where the M2 slot is."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6063,So I only have a single slot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6063,Also did you folks find the stock SSD very hot?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6063,It is a Samsung PM991 512GB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6063,Perform a virus scan and it hits 81 degs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6064,Sian seems like my Dell XPS refund might not happen...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6064,Anyone interested to take the IdeaPad 5 off me?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6065,I thought you've used the XPS for awhile right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6065,Why are you getting it refunded?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6066,"Had some issues with the screen, long bootup times 45 seconds, microSD getting stuck in the slot, etc"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6066,...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6066,I got it for less than 2 mths actually.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6066,Now they offering whole unit replacement instead.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6067,Today I started performing some cooling enhancements and swapping out my SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6067,"Now in the process of cloning it, and man, that stock Samsung drive is blazing hot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6067,"I applied a copper heat spread on it, and when I touched it, I scalded my finger."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6067,I can't keep my finger there for a fraction of a second.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6068,"Wow, premium price command premium service."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6068,Whole unit replacement I've not experienced it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6069,sell the xps as BNIB lor..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6069,later change again got problem
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6070,Hmmm yeah
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6070,I think change already might not solve the issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6070,Could be a route I will try to go haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6070,Just that non macs very hard to sell
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6071,Interestingly just did a Cinebench test and got 2859 very close to my desktop 1700 at 2975 running at base clock with no OC
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6072,Does this support usb c charging?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6073,Yes it does!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6073,Minimum 30w required I think.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6074,Change fan profile to extreme performance and power settings to max performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6074,Should be able to get 3.1k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6075,Yes it does for the Lenovo IdeaPad 5
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6076,"By the way, I have uploaded my calibrated display profile here:"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6076,This is based on the B140HAN04.E display.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6076,"Think out of the box, the uncalibrated display profile is too blue-ish."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6076,Don't expect wonders though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6076,"It's just to make the colours accurate, but will not magically change the display."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6077,I got an offer for the laptop and am sadly parting with my one and only octa core processor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6077,Will have to live with my slower quad core laptop for the next few years.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6077,But for daily use I think not much difference ba.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6077,Haha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6078,The supplied charger is not a type c cable right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6079,The supplied charger is not type C.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6080,I had a T495s
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6080,"and when I bought it I didn't ""upgrade"" the stock 1920x1080 250nits LCD"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6080,and now I felt that it is too dark.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6080,Possible to upgrade to a 300nits or 400nits LCD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6080,Wondering how much does it cost from Lenovo?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6081,It should be possible.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6081,Search lenovo's website for the list of FRUs available.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6081,"As long as the replacement is within one of the FRUs because Lenovo has a whitelist in BIOS, it should be fine."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6082,i found the lenovo part number
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6082,and it is available for T495s.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6082,"If i buy online from overseas abt US$140+++, anyplace how to change?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6082,My warranty will be gone ar?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6082,I still hv 2 yrs
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6082,plus... possible to buy and ask Lenovo to change for me?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6083,can try those pc repair shops at SIM lim or pc dreams I guess...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6083,But yeah maybe can try Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6083,I guess if the replacement is done properly nobody might ever find out
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6083,it was ever changed lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6084,Normally how much those shop will charge to change the panel?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6085,anyone actually tried the WWAN feature?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6085,I didn't get but wondering if I missed anything
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6085,lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6086,About $100 I think.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6086,WWAN is basically you can put in a SIM card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6086,Useful if you work often on the go and have no Wi-Fi
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6086,I guess...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6086,"By the way, this Chinese website has quite a comprehensive review of the Slim 7:"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6086,Cinebench R20 multi-score is 3.8k lolol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6087,lcd panel replacement is easy to diy even with no experience.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6087,Watch youtube video.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6088,wow didnt know that Lenovo has a full removal and replacement maintenance manual and video...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6088,It looks easy except not too sure if they will put too much glue or tape for the bezel to be removed...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6088,Here is the link for those who wants to DIY.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6089,Thanks for your calibration
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6089,"but when I tried it, its too warm for my liking, anyway good work!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6090,performance is really good for integrated
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6091,It sure is...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6091,Too bad
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6091,I'm now stuck on ice lake gen11 graphics and toasty temperature haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6092,Legion 5 4600H/4800H and Ideapad Flex 5 4500U/4700U now on Lenovo SG.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6092,6-8 weeks and 2 weeks to ship.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6093,"I also came across this interesting 2nd gen offering:
QHD 16:10 screen in an IdeaPad 5 series and 35w CPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6093,Too bad only one config available
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6094,just need 16gb ram and its good to go
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6095,nice find!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6095,spec out the legion 5 cost around 2k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6096,Why only gtx 1650?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6096,Thought have rtx option?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6097,Flex 5 looks decent also..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6097,man still waiting for those thinkpads
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6098,Think that is 5i version.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6098,should be intel only
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6099,The features in 5 say up to rtx though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6099,"Although not surprising if only 5i, typical intel bribing oem."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6100,IdeaPad and legion durable?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6100,"Several years I bought one consumer graded Lenovo, it will always fail near warranty end period."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6100,Initially the motherboard died just before 2 yrs heng few days before 2 yrs mark and got the board replaced.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6100,"But just after 2 yrs of changing motherboard, it died again..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6100,Whereas Thinkpad that I used before can last for a long time and got one lasted more than 8 yrs and still functioning.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6101,Anyone know the brightness level of this model?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6101,Need at least 300 nits
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6102,"Bought a Flex 5 yesterday and got a good discount from the CSO always speak to them, got 2x powerbanks previously for not buying anything and just being nice"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6102,lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6102,Fingers crossed for the 2 weeks delivery!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6103,"after customizing, its around 1.6k not a bad price"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6104,intel is sinking fast
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6105,"Not bad for the price, seems like it comes with stylus support as well?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6106,"Yea, I'm looking for 2 in 1s mainly due to my work nature"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6106,"Been deliberating for on the new HP Envys x360 13, Asus Flips and Lenovo series."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6106,"Did all research possible, and decided to pull the trigger on Flex due to price point under 1k cause of discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6106,Still a bit gutted that HP delayed the AMD release of HP Envys due to Covid
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6106,cause the design blows the rest of the 2 in 1s out of the water.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6106,"But for 300 dollars lesser, the Flex is a very very viable alternative."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6107,Good price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6107,Too bad I got my laptop recently
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6107,", otherwise the Legion 5 is going to be a great desktop replacement."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6108,When is HP releasing the Envy 2in1s?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6108,Been waiting for it since its released in the UK.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6108,The Flex looks good but that 45% ntsc screen is a deal breaker for me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6109,"Any good discount code to share, been asking their cso the best I got"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6109,is 6% off
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6110,"Intel is starting to feel the pain with AMD hitting their 2 main cash cows, enterprise and laptop business."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6111,Good friend works as HP Global Sales Director.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6111,Slated to arrive Mid June/Early July.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6111,"And even with him pulling strings, discount quite minimal"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6111,so yup!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6112,try entering the code the CSO give
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6112,u.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6112,He gave me the same thing as Roteus did in a PM
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6112,"but when u enter the same code, the discount percentage is far larger."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6112,"I suspect from tomorrow on wards, it will be from 6% and not as large as now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6112,I upgrade to the 2 years onsite for 30 buck.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6112,Also buy via shopback
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6112,", hopefully got another 5% off"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6112,Use my new HSBC credit card where spend above $800 in 1st mth get 150 cashback.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6112,"If all goes well, lowish $700 for a AMD zen 2 convertible lappie"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6112,"Alas the screen is 250 nits, if its a 300 nit screen, it would have been a steal."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6113,The Legion 5 is cheap
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6113,lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6113,"I configured for 4800H, 16Gb RAM, 512Gb SSD,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6113,"60Hz 300nit IPS sRGB 100% and GTX1650Ti 4Gb, $1689 before discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6113,Use the CSO coupon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6113,Bring down to $1435.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6113,The coupon states up to 6%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6113,But for the discount like this it is 15% off.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6114,The cso coupon is once off or common one?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6114,Can sic if it's latter?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6114,Sent from Rem Best Grill using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6115,Got to key in their REP ID in order to work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6115,So yes once off.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6116,"Yes very true, plus power efficiency is very critical in big data centres, servers as well as laptops."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6116,Intel failed in these areas for power efficiency.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6116,My Lenovo S730 is so hot at times that
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6116,it auto reboot
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6116,hahaha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6117,hmm it just die die include the rgb mouse and the backpack in the cart
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6118,Ca you share with me your specs and how much you paid?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6118,Also what type of stylus works with it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6118,Is it USI stylus?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6118,Any idea of where to buy and how much?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6118,Thank you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6119,You could uncheck the mouse and backpack at the last page.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6120,Yes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6120,The page got issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6120,Remove it manually before the checkout.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6120,"The software, accessories tab."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6121,Any idea what the price would be like?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6121,The Envy x360 uses a Realtek Wi-Fi 5 chip instead of the Intel Wi-Fi 6.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6121,Seems like a dealbreaker in 2020
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6122,A Chinese review of the Legion 5 4800H known as the R7000 in China versus Legion 5i 10750H Y7000.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6122,Short summary
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6122,": AMD trashes Intel config which costs ~S$320 more, 1650Ti is not worth the upgrade over 1650."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6123,Dunno when the new AMD Thinkpad will be out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6123,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6124,The 1650Ti is not worth the upgrade from 1650 for sure.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6124,Considering the key difference between the 2 was the use of GDDR6 vs GDDR5.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6124,"But now Nvidia have moved all their product stack to GDDR6,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6124,so not worth paying that extra 100 bucks to upgrade.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6125,Told you they will find someways to gimp the AMD laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6126,Hmm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6126,Is just the screen leh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6126,60hz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6126,300nits
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6126,IPS with 100% sRGB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6126,The 120hz panel is with a poorer sRGB lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6126,How sia.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6126,But from the looks of it a 1650 or 1650ti for AAA game titles
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6126,i doubt it can hit 120fps unless i lower the graphics settings.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6127,"For the price of $1322 after discounts, can get specs of."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6127,4600H better than 4700u
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6127,128GB SSD. 15 inch 100% rgb panel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6127,16GB ram.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6127,GTX 1650
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6127,4GB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6127,Seems like a better deal than the $1250 Lazada flash sale a few days ago
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6128,Not everyone want to lug a 2.5KG laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6129,"Frankly, if I'm willing to lug a 2.5kg laptop, I would expect that they allow me to go for the higher end RTX cards like at least a 2070"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6129,so that I can have the option of using it as a desktop replacement with a powerful laptop cooler when I want to realise the full performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6129,"I mean, those have been squeezed into laptops lighter than 2kg, albeit with throttling."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6130,Anybody interested in taking over my IdeaPad slim 5 Ryzen 7 4700U please pm me..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6130,I am switching alliances to legion 5 Liao 😂
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6131,It is true if you are looking at just the hardware.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6131,"But then again, nowadays people want a slim and light laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6131,So this may not suit everyone.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6132,"Unfortunately, the highest end card you can configure with this is the GTX 1650Ti."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6132,I do agree I won't mind having a greater than 2kg laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6132,"I don't bring it out often, so weight is no issue for me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6133,The Legion 5's exact weight is 2.26kg.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6133,It is slightly lighter than the Thinkpad T60 I used years ago.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6134,cant imagine you need to travel with that weight during pre wuhan virus period
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6135,I think the Legion 5 would be a great lappy for photo editors.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6135,Yes it may comes with a crappy gtx1650 or TI.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6135,But nevertheless photo editors dont really need one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6135,I really thinking to buy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6135,But i would love to have at least a gtx1660Ti or rtx2060 for me to game by night lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6136,It should have up to rtx though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6136,Maybe can wait as more variant of the model roll out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6137,2.5kg is really for.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6137,a shoulder to cry on
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6137,"i thinking to change to 16"" mbp to replace my old desktop also to relieve some space on my table."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6137,i wouldn't wanna bring out a 2kg laptop lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6137,if needed
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6137,i will just lug my x1c out
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6138,But you need to account for the noise of the fans.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6138,These gaming grade laptops normally comes with jet turbine fans at full tilt.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6139,"From the yt review,  gaming on the 1650s already hitting 80-90 degree liao,  if put in higher end gpu mayb can diy cooking lo"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6141,glossy gg
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6142,Hmm but the intel version 5i put in rtx2060 leh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6142,Lol i think they got space to put a few more heatpipes
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6142,ba
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6143,Initial marketing material shown that it has up to RTX2060:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6143,But now their product database stated GPU max out at 1650Ti:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6143,"Have to wait and see whether will it be equipped with rtx2060 in the future, read from other source that it's varied by region."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6144,once you use UB you don't want to lug 2.5kg liao unless you're BBFA
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6145,Legion = heavy and powerful one put at home.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6145,X1C = light and powerful can bring out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6145,X395 = light and mid-ranged also can bring out
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6146,They still indicate it at the feature / spec page
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6147,I believe what they offer may differ between countries/ regions as you rightfully pointed out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6148,Same laptop model that they reviewed?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6148,"I feel the 1650 runs hot if the cooling is poor, i.e. slim laptops."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6148,"I don't know how good is the cooling solution on the Legion 5, but should be good enough to dissipate the heat from a GTX 1650 reasonably well for its size."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6149,"Based on HK/UK lenovo site, GTX1660Ti and RTX2060 equipped Legion 5 will be available in 2nd half of the year, varied by regions:"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6150,The specs is interesting.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6150,Max TDP?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6150,so the graphics component should be close to mx350 if not better?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6154,actually if you guys want to buy for home use..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6154,the deskmini  akan datang might be better
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6155,I like the form factor of the Deskmini.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6155,In fact I was planning to get one with a 3200G to go along as a HTPC.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6155,"But after much consideration, I decided to just go for an ITX rig instead because I find the chipset and the number of USB ports very limiting."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6155,"Moreover back then, the fastest DDR4 Sodimm runs at 2933 Mhz and cost a lot more than a pair of desktop DDR4 3200."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6156,what about now the sodimm still ex????
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6156,ITX still a lot bigger right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6156,the power is with the int.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6156,GPU....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6156,imho
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6157,tech epiphany does a lot of comparison.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6157,just search the model you want
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6158,i have 3 usb hubs attached to my deskmini.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6158,So from 3 ports > 11 usb ports.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6158,no issues so far
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6159,That is one way.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6159,"I have USB hubs, but would prefer for minimal cables since its on my TV console."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6160,Sodimm is usually more expensive and slower than desktop rams.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6160,Other limitation with the Deskmini is that its OC locked.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6160,I was planning to OC it somewhat to squeeze more performance from the GPU in particular.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6161,Got such thing as 1.5kg 4600H?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6165,A few more days to wait..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6166,mine also..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6166,I think its coz of the plane.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6166,doesn't fly direct to sg from hk.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6166,"so they go tw to pick up, then Shenzhen before coming to sg"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6167,Looking real good..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6167,hope we got local versions.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6168,"Now UPS update as still in Shenzhen, delivery rescheduled."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6168,What a bummer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6169,There is no chance of you getting it today if the item is still in Shenzhen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6169,"Besides flying item over takes time, it needs to clear customs, go to the sorting hub before it gets dispatched."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6169,"So all in all, it could take an extra day or 2."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6170,waiting for ryzen 4000 series thinkpad laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6171,Ups show
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6171,Mine is hefei to shanghai now..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6172,If shanghai only then still long way.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6172,Mine went to HK and KR then come down to SG.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6172,That also delay in SG.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6172,I ordered my E595 when CB started.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6172,Only to receive it last 3 weeks back.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6172,Overall will take between 3 wks to 4 wks to ship.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6173,"It was already shipped, not in production stage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6174,The strange travel pattern could likely be attributed to the fact that there are a lot of travel restrictions.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6174,"So perhaps from HK, there is no direct flight because have not lifted ban to travel to SG."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6174,So a lot of walkaround to get the product on our shores resulting in delays.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6175,Yes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6175,Go one big round then reach you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6175,Their tracking now also very hard to believe.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6176,Just got the expected date for my Flex 14 to arrive..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6176,It's almost a 1.5 month wait for them to ship the product.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6176,It's REALLY long
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6176,and I might be thinking of a cancellation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6176,Just a heads-up for the rest of you yea
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6177,Hope it's only due to Covid-19.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6177,Lenovo should not sell laptops if they are unable to fulfill delivery deadline.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6177,My last ThinkPad also got delayed and they promised to compensate a cheap HDD which they didn't even keep to it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6178,I think there are multiple hurdles for them to fulfill orders quickly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6178,1
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6178,"Low supply of components, and I believe supply for Renoir is still very limited."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6178,2.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6178,"Limited number of flights to transport components due to historic low travel, and to also deliver the product to you."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6178,3.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6178,Travel restrictions affects point 2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6178,"So if you need a laptop urgently, you should get one where stock is available locally."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6178,"If you customize or pre-order, it will take quite long at this point."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6178,Unless the 3 points above improve in the near future.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6179,Just wanted to share my purchase.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6179,I got a Lenovo E595 recently
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6179,and it's customized.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6179,"Ordered May 15, Shipped May 19, Expected to arrive May 22."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6179,Perhaps its running on the older ryzen and they trying to clear stock.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6180,Better check periodically.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6180,I ordered during first day of cb.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6180,And it only came 3 weeks later.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6180,Not to wet blanket
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6180,"you, the shipping time is like a rubber kind."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6180,I from April 22nd delivery date but rubber till 29th April.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6180,And that also got delayed to be shipped to my house.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6180,I got it only 1st May.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6181,whoa that is super long wait
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6182,On its website also mentioned 6-8 weeks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6182,Sent from Rem Best Grill using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6183,Lenovo need to do something about delivery timing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6183,"Apple is the best, order today, get it tomorrow using UPS."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6184,Yesterday I posted it was at hefei and shanghai..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6184,Now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6184,Latest update....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6184,At Korean inchon..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6184,Around 12pm..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6184,Ups put expected delivery date as 22may.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6184,9pm..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6184,Doubt I can get it tomorrow...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6185,"Yeap, it was altered after."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6185,"On the day I placed the order, it was stated as within 2 weeks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6185,Checked with CSO as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6185,Mine's a Ready to Ship order.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6185,Granted
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6185,it's Covid
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6185,"and I've tailored my expectations for the arrival, but it still is a far stretch."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6185,"Not angry or pissed, just..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6185,sian?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6185,"Anyway, sent a mail to their CS about this issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6185,Will update.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6186,locally retails all closed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6186,how to buy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6186,online is the oinly way
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6187,"Yes, I mean online."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6187,"Even on Lazada, you can find laptops that they can deliver same day, if not next day."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6187,"May not be the config that you want, but the option is there."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6187,"I was anticipating more delays with Renoir laptops, so I pulled the trigger on a laptop with Ice Lake and it arrived the same day I ordered."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6188,Yea because the stock is sitting in an SG warehouse
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6189,same here buddy
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6189,..think im gon cancel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6190,Any touch screen laptop with latest AMD Ryzen to intro?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6191,Envy x360 but not out yet
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6192,"If not urgent just wait lo,  treat it as a pre-order"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6192,Sent from Rem Best Grill using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6193,Lenovo got local store in SG too or they can have an improved delivery timing like 1 to 1.5 weeks the most.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6193,3 to 4 weeks is too long.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6194,Their local store is run by addon systems.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6194,Think they are found on Lazada
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6194,Lenovo's warehouse is in Malaysia...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6194,Same as dell
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6195,dell US also out liao.. not shure SG
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6196,"If it's 3 to 4 weeks, I doubt it's actually coming from an inventory locally."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6196,"I've no idea about Lenovo's supply chain, but I do know Apple uses a major logistics provider to warehouse their supply chain in SG, releasing online purchases to 4 different couriers to deliver in SEA region previously worked with one of the couriers"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6197,Lenovo sent their laptops straight from their factory from China.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6198,Ya...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6198,Mine state hefei china..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6198,Ups pick up..

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6198,Hopefully can get today...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6199,I just order online today for E595 about 827am.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6199,"It stated 2 business days as cannot be customize, customize version got to wait very long."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6199,Will it ship in 2 business day like next week Tue
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6199,or Wed can get it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6199,Online chat says can get it got stocks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6199,My credit card already charged full amount as started 1SGD for online order submit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6200,"Also depends on the courier schedule too, so might have delay"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6200,Sent from Rem Is Best Waifu using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6201,"If they have stock locally, it should not be a problem to get it to you in 2 business days."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6202,IdeaPad Slim 7 now available for order in the US
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6203,Able to ship to sg??
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6203,Lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6204,Hmmm they say is next business day shipping...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6204,But only 8gb config available now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6204,I guess can use forwarder if really desperate
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6205,8GB is soldered?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6205,Later can't upgrade then you are stuck with 8GB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6206,redmi
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6207,Yup soldered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6207,It's lpddr4x.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6207,There's a 16gb 1tb up for preorder in Europe...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6207,999 Euro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6207,Wonder how much it will cost in sg?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6207,1.8k?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6208,"Would you guys buy a new t495 with the following config for $1,200?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6208,Ryzen 7 3700u.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6208,8gb ram + 8gb sodimm
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6208,512gb SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6208,Full hd display
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6208,400 nits should be 100% sRGB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6208,Found this deal on carousell.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6208,Not sure if T14 with Renoir will be this cheap?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6209,Found on tabao Lenovo Legion with the following specs
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6209,Ryzen  R7-4800.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6209,16 GB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6209,GTX-1650ti
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6209,512 SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6209,Price is about the same as Lenovo website excluding shipping charges
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6209,Is it advisable to get Lenovo laptops via tabao?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6209,Are there issues with international warranty?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6209,Appreciate it if anyone can provide info.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6209,Thanks!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6210,Why note buying at Lenovo website
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6210,Posted with Nokia 8310 HardwareZone Forums app
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6211,suggest u take a look at lenovo sg site better
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6212,new intel thinkpads avaliable in US.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6212,base on their manual..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6212,T14s only 1 heatpipe..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6212,if they use this for the amd variant.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6212,better to get T14 for better performance?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6213,Any opinion on this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6213,I saw last year
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6213,NDP period got similar price...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6213,Thinking maybe I sell my XPS 13 hopefully can fetch 2k plus
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6213,once I get my new replacement unit and get this...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6213,Upgrade to wireless AX on my own.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6213,Keep the extra 1k for other purposes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6213,How much is T14 AMD expected to cost when it comes out?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6214,how much do you think my S730 yoga can sell.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6214,still got warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6214,6 months or so.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6214,worth to upgrade?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6214,i5-8565.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6214,16gb.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6214,512ssd
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6215,Don't think Legion series has international warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6215,Besides you need to factor in GST unless the seller under-declares the product value.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6216,probably 1k or 1.1k if in good condition...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6217,"1 heatpipe, unless its a big one, otherwise do expect quite a fair bit of throttling."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6218,not worth since entry level
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6218,"4300u outperforms 3700u
https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/AMD-Ryzen-3-4300U-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-3700U/3664vs3426"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6219,Thanks bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6219,Didn't know the perf gap was so wide...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6220,4th gen ryzen is really blowing the competition right now...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6220,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6221,"In terms of CPU, Renoir certainly have an advantage over the Ryzen 7 3700U, but when it comes to graphics, I think the latter is"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6221,more formidable assuming cooling is not a problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6222,It is.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6222,Intel have nothing to compete in the laptop space when it comes to CPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6222,So they start trumpeting the high clockspeed which it can never hit with the cooling capability of almost all the laptops.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6222,GPU wise
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6222,", I think Tiger Lake may be able to compete with Renoir, but that is not enough to give them the advantage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6223,"yup..
looks like T14 is the better choice."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6224,do you have the t495?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6224,Just wondering how performance is like
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6225,They compete by cutting prices.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6226,T495 is amazingly good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6226,"I am using 1 now with 1TB, 32GB Ram and 400 nits display, and even had a SIM slot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6226,It gets all the job done and had a 89% grade on notebookcheck.com.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6226,If you can wait then get the new Ryzen CPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6226,I am eagerly anticipating manufacturers to release their Renoir offerings.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6227,Nope.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6227,"Was originally planning to get a T495, but went with the IdeaPad 5 instead."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6227,My feedback was purely looking at the specs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6227,"Renoir is clearly a better choice if CPU is your key focus, and less so on the graphics."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6227,"Renoir's top end chip with Vega 7 or 8 may not be a problem, but at the lower end, the Vega 5 and 6, may not fare as well even with a hefty clockspeed advantage when you compare it with the Vega 10 on the 3700U."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6228,Price cutting is not the Intel style man.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6228,"At least looking at current laptops with Intel processors in there, I don't see a meaningful price decline despite Renoir being made official and released."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6229,"I feel specs and build wise, it is great."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6229,"But cooling wise, I think it is no better than the E485"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6229,"I had previously, looking at some of the images."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6229,This is not surprising given the size.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6229,"The successor I think will be even slimmer, and not sure if the ram is still upgradeable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6229,I suspect it will be soldered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6230,Thanks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6230,How much did you pay for this spec?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6230,"Right now the guy on Carousell is offering $1,080 for 8GB RAM or $1,150 with an extra 8GB RAM in the open slot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6230,I don't know if he can be trusted
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6230,but I guess I can look at the box to confirm the specs before buying.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6230,"I'm just wondering whether price wise, will the T14 AMD become similarly expensive like the Intel counterparts."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6230,"The L14 Intel already starts at US$1,389 in the US, and that's with an i3 and 4GB of RAM..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6230,"I thought quite a bit about my requirements, and I guess CPU performance just needs to be 'good enough' for me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6230,- Decent graphics to be able to run dual 4K@60Hz not for gaming
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6230,- Keyboard area doesn't heat up under normal use.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6230,"- No lag when web browsing, running WordPress, using Lightroom to make image edits, etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6230,- Good battery life -- 5-6 hours on web browsing?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6231,Even the base Legion 515 with Ryzen 5 4600H
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6231,this new CPU is as fast or slightly faster than i7-9750
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6231,Much less the 4800U one Im getting.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6231,"I configured one with 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6231,"GTX1650 Non Ti and 120Hz screen.. used the code the CSO gave, only $1333 on Lenovo SG website."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6231,The only drawback is long waiting time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6231,Min 6-8 weeks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6232,The Acer Swift 3 is finally here...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6232,Ryzen 5 3500U. 8GB and 512GB config only though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6232,1098
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6232,"This config with 16GB RAM for $1,198"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6232,"Compared to the IdeaPad 5, it has slower proc, less RAM, but supports HDMI 2.0 output and USB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6232,3.1 Gen 2 speeds.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6233,Hey guys~ I've been lurking in the dark reading the input that you guys have
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6233,shared~
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6233,so not sure if anyone know
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6233,"but there is a code """
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6233,"Shopback18"""
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6233,that you can use one lenovo sg's site for 18% discount and plus cashback if you use shopback~
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6233,My friend configured the Legion 5 for 100% srgb with 512 ssd and 16 gb ram I think~ discount approx 250sgd and cash back
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6233,approx 40 sgd~
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6233,go
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6233,have a try~
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6233,No need PM lenovo cs for their code for so much hassel?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6233,haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6233,The code is valid until 31 May 2020.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6233,Hope it helps
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6234,Ryzen 5.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6234,4500U
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6235,The CSO code is THANKYOU
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6235,but its only valid if you include the CSO tag number or something
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6235,", not so sure about this."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6235,But the discount % is different across different models it seems.. and slightly better than Shopback18
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6236,Whoops...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6236,Big typo there
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6236,Always find it confusing when they refer to 3rd gen Ryzen processors but the model numbers all start with 4000...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6237,Aite thanks!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6238,I rmbr it as Laptop range being one gen behind.. easier 😅
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6238,But the 4600/4800H really impressive based on benchmarks on YouTube.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6239,"Flex 5 with DDR4 16gb ram, Ryzen 7 4700u"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6239,", 1tb ssd is only $1000+ after the best promo code given by a friendly CA."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6240,The promo codes given by the CSO must be use with including the CSO ID else
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6240,You will receive a call asking for the name of the CSO and sadly the order will be cancelled if you are unable to provide The necessary information
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6241,Then it means you just need to remember code and CSO ID.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6242,Wonder what's the graphics performance with 16gb of ram?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6242,so far see reviews all is 8g...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6242,dual channel..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6242,how much more performance can we squeeze for the IGPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6242,The screen is not fantastic also.. need some calibration i think.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6243,interesting...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6243,vega 6 versus
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6243,mx350..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6243,4500U..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6243,So 4700u or 4800u with decent cooling should get us close.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6243,dual channel fast ram should help also.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6243,feed that beast!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6244,mx350 still very entry right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6245,New BIOS update 1.57 released for E485/E585
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6246,Mx350 is still a faster card imo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6246,If based on paper specs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6246,4600U < 4700U < 4800U
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6246,< Mx350
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6246,But the difference between 4800U to Mx350 performance very negligible.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6246,If feed the 4800U 3200Mhz ram assuming if it can support yes it will match the mx350.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6246,Its not easy for a iGPU to beat entirely a dedicated gpu such as gtx1650 onwards.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6246,Probably not now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6246,But in the future it can be done if they can shrink to a smaller process node to pack more transistor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6247,Anyone waiting for the new yoga slim 7?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6248,Not too bad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6248,It's a slower gtx1050 mobile I think
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6249,Ports wise the Acer beats the Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6249,"Comes with 10gbps usb 3.1, displayport 1.4, hdmi 2.0 and wifi6."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6249,If you want something more future proof this is it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6249,No point having so much power when you realise down the road
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6249,you cannot hook it up to multiple displays
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6249,etc... Limits its potential.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6249,Plus no need to wait 4 weeks for shipping.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6250,"yep considered ""dedicated"" entry level gpu.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6250,good enough for light gaming in a slim form factor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6250,"if can reach that level on a IGPU..feed it with the dual channel high speed ram, decent cooling, drawing lesser power, we got legit hot cake cpu!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6250,Unfortunately we are pretty much limited by what OEM or manufacturer willing to spec..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6251,I felt we should not be expecting a lot from ultra series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6251,Perhaps just getting the 4500U is the best already.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6251,need to manage battery time also
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6252,"I paid $1,123.76 with mouse, bag and 3 years onsite warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6252,T495 hdmi and USB c should be able to power 2 x 4k screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6252,please double check
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6252,Running WordPress and lightroom should be fine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6252,Battery life is worse than Intel version.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6252,Is he selling ryzen 5 or ryzen 7 version?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6252,Please note that mine is Ryzen 5 only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6252,"If you can, please wait for another 2 months for the new CPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6252,The performance is much better then the present CPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6253,They had announced price cut at least in America.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6254,"I also had E585, Ryzen 7 2700U, 16GB, 512GB and 1 TB SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6254,"Built quality, T495 is much better."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6254,"And comes with fingerprint, hello windows login."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6254,"Better WiFi, mic and screen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6254,Of course it also cause more
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6255,Ryzen 7
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6255,but I guess not much diff since all quad core.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6255,Wow
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6255,"okay, didn't know it was so cheap back then"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6256,Just saw some shopee and Lazada promoting Lenovo IdeaPad 5 4700U
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6256,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6257,They have live chat on the website.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6257,Very eager to answer any query.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6257,Not difficult to get the code.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6258,If you check YouTube..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6258,MX350 means gaming everything on Low 1080P with roughly 40-50 FPS max.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6258,Some even need one notch lower to 900P or 720P.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6258,Not worth it for me..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6258,min is 1650 for me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6258,Which the Legion can be had for base $1299 before discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6258,Around $1180.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6259,You should check out Lenovo's website
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6260,Which is why iirc nvidia supposedly going to launch mx450 which make mx350 the lower end model
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6261,1080p low with
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6261,40-50fps is still pretty good for the weight.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6261,Mainly for light gaming is fine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6261,For heavier gaming..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6261,i advise minimum at least a dedicated gpu.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6261,I feel at that point the price and category is different already
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6262,agreed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6262,T495 quality is much better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6262,Hoping the T14 is good also
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6263,indeed it is easy to get the codes but there are many variety of codes granting different % of discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6263,Neither LENOVOPRO or THANKYOU gives the best discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6264,This would interesting.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6264,big batt..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6265,You are not wrong from the customer standpoint.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6265,"But Say the CSO gave you a limited ""PROMO"" code that can only be given out to selective customers.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6265,"and we, the customer shared around, the CSO will have a hard time explaining to the team head why so many people are using the ""LIMITED"" promo code tagged with his CSO ID."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6265,however the above doesnt apply to THANKYOU & LENOVOPRO as those are not limited promo codes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6265,so feel free to spam
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6266,Now quite expensive
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6266,leh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6266,1.6k for similar config.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6266,You bought during the NDP promo previously?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6267,"CSO ID, that should never change."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6267,"As to why you need to message the CSO for the code in the first place, I think its just pure marketing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6267,"At the checkout page, they even prompt you to speak to the CSO for better offer."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6267,"Personally, I feel they could have just auto apply the codes, but for PR stunt, this additional step of asking for better offer through the CSO, probably just makes the person feel better after seeing a better discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,"Imo, i felt that those wanna game e sports title, you should be getting minimally a gtx1650/Ti."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,This will churn out pretty well fps for those e sports games and some indie games.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,This gtx1650ti wont break the bank with any config be it intel or amd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,With price bracket between $1.2k-$1.4k depending on the storage and memory config.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,Some AAA game titles you will need a gtx1660Ti instead.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,"This is the so call sweet spot for 1080p gaming with a few textures tone down in settings, you should be able to rock those games well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,There is a leap in performance from a gtx1650 to gtx1660Ti.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,"And of cause with that said, it cost anywhere from $1.6k till 2.2k between intel or amd and depending on the storage and memory config."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,Also this category got many price range.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,From lousy screens to good screens.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,With just 10% more improvement comes the rtx2060.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,Now this is where i find its the limit for laptop gaming should go.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,The amount of heat coming out in most gaming laptop can rather be very toasty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,Of cause its faster than the gtx1660Ti.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,But not much difference.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,And most of the laptop pricing starts from 2.2k onwards.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,Then comes the atas rtx2070-2080.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,"Which imo, this route is far too ex and a lot of cooling needed for a laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,And the price for it is far too much to ask for.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,"If one needed that level of gaming performance, a desktop would be a better buy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6268,Or perhaps a small ITX rig to bring around if needed lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6269,"Prior to landing on Lenovos offer for Legion 515 at around $1180 with above said GPU base model, Ive seen so many with worse off GPU like MX250/350 at prices between $1200-1400."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6269,A maxed out Legion 5 with Ryzen 7 4800H and
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6269,GTX1650
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6269,"Ti, 16GB DDR4 RAM and 512GB SSD is only $1450 after discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6269,So tempting!!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6270,Bro pls share if you got better one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6270,"Ive tried both the above 2 codes, they work out to be the same % discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6270,Thanks!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6271,ya...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6271,the price is tempting!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6272,thinkpad series probably the 1650/1660 in the extreme series..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6273,Yeap yeap.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6273,"Remember ah guys, dont just aim for the highest spec and just hantam money on it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6273,Look at the cooling potential first before buying.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6273,Dont just buy blindly and thinking that hey my gpu or cpu is suppose to be fast!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6273,But in actual fact slows down because hitting the temps limit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6274,"I have talk to cso for promo code , in the end after the comparison the shopback18 still better"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6275,"Hi,anyone bought the legion 15"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6275,what configuration do you choose
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6276,Currently out of stock but ships to SG.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6278,"Hi,how about the ram?which coupon did you use"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6279,I think it depends on the weight for the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6279,Most sub 2KG laptops should sport a MX series graphic card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6279,The likes of Legion 5 is more on the gaming laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6279,But I agree that the Legion 5 is very enticing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6280,Yoga slim
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6280,7 China review out here:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6280,"First impressions is hot, and issues outputting to 4k display."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6280,Build quality also not as good as the older s740 which I thought was pretty bad when I owned it lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6281,What code did you use?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6281,I
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6281,cant bring it to that price with those specs.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6284,The legion 5 gtx1650 upgrade to gtx1650ti is it worth?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6285,My friend's order for Legion 5 just shipped from factory.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6285,Not yet arrived.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6285,"Took only 1 week to ship, not 6-8 weeks."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6287,"Probably less than <S$1,200"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6288,Its around 5-10% faster or more FPS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6288,At lower settings and older games the diff in performance is more pronounced but this means little to me since I will play my games in 1080P high settings if possible.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6288,Cost diff is around $70-80 premium after using discount code.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6288,I
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6288,havent
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6288,"buy yet, waiting for the guy earlier to share his code."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6289,5%-10% improvement.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6289,The real leap would be the gtx1660ti.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6289,There is a gap in between this and gtx1650 or 1650ti.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6289,But one must take account on what games
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6289,are you gonna play.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6289,1660ti is quite close to the rtx2060.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6289,Just do not have ray tracing hardware in it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6289,"But even if it has ray tracing, gtx1660ti sure bo muscle to run smoothly."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6290,Yes correct.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6291,GPU experts..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6291,"GTX1650 have DDR5 and DDR6, big diff?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6291,Lenovo CSO told me GTX1650 Max-Q means equal to desktop counterpart hence better than normal GTX1650.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6291,Zhun bo??
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6291,😂
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6292,Anyone also looking at ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 GA401V?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6292,Seems to have many rave reviews.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6293,"I see,Same here hope to get for best discount code before purchasing🙂"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6294,1650 to 1650ti the difference..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6294,i feel not worth the extra money..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6294,if jump to 1660TI than ya got difference.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6295,can't pre order on taobao leh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6296,Yeap.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6296,Gaming is concern then get 1660ti and above.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6296,Not unless your gaming at low or indie games or some less intensive esports title.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6297,Can.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6297,Link :
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6297,"However for you to do a preorder, you need to have funds in your alipay account."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6297,You can't use your default payment method to pay for the pre-order.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6297,The remaining amount could be paid during checkout with your default payment method.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6297,Current model for pre-order is all R5 4500U 16GB + 512GB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6297,At least on taobao Mi Store .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6297,"Only the 13"" have the 8GB Variant"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6298,Redmibook 13 doesn't seem like 100% sRGB?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6299,"I just realized it as well, i thought they refreshed the 13"" model"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6299,Anyway whoever interested in the 4700U model can pre-order from Mi China website :
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6299,"Please make sure you have a forwarder, as they do not ship internationally"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6310,"if I roll-back to 4600H, it will be under 1.2K"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6311,Is 4800h worth the upgrade over 4600h?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6312,I just ran CB R20 on my Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6312,It has Ryzen 7
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6312,4700U.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6312,The scores came out to be 3004.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6312,I couldn't believe my eyes since YT reviewers got around ~2600ish.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6312,So I ran it again.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6312,Guess what?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6312,3020!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6312,"At a score of 3020, it is on par with the i9-9880H 8c/16t, 45W, and handily beats the i7-9750H 6c/12t, 45W, 2550ish."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6312,"This seems very weird to me as the 4700U is 8c/8t, and 15W TDP."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6312,"Plus, the score is 400ish higher than YT reviewers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6312,P.S.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6312,My desktop 3600 manages 3500ish.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6313,Order from where?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6314,whoa!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6314,with decent cooling its doing well
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6315,The weird thing is the Ideapad Slim 5 is a thin and light laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6315,"It's 1.5/1.6kg, and very slim."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6315,The cooling solution is very basic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6315,"Looking at the result for the U variant, I think the H variant is even more OP-ed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6315,"Quite a number of YT reviewers have published performance results for the 4900HS, and it absolutely creams the i9-9980HK"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6315,even when the Intel chip is running at max TDP with the best cooling solution.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6315,"Thanks AMD, for kicking Intel in the nuts with this sick release!"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6317,"Hi, where did you buy the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5 from?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6318,No so cheap leh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6319,The problem with the Intel chips is that they are not able to sustain a reasonably high clockspeed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6319,Which is why they are lagging behind.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6319,"Despite a lower TDP, AMD chips can sustain a higher clockspeed due to the significantly more power efficient 7nm, as compared to Intel's 14nm."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6319,"Intel chips still have the advantage if they can clock higher than a Zen 2 chip, but in the case of a laptop, heat and power severely limits their whatever clockspeed boost technology."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6320,This shows the efficiency gap between 7nm and 14nm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6320,"Couple with an ageing architecture, Intel is not competitive in the mobile space anymore."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6320,I feel even Tiger Lake U on 10nm
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6320,will not turn their misfortunes around.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6321,Infinito Atrix.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6321,They are active in Lazada and Shopee.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6321,There's a thread in the Tech Show sub-forum warning about their dubious business practices
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6321,but I decided to go with them since the huge number of positive reviews on both platform cannot lie.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6321,This particular model is going for 1298 on Shopee.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6321,Their store on Lazada price it at 1498.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6321,"However, now already OOS, need pre-order with arrival in mid-July."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6321,"Another thing to note is that this is the only model out of the many, many models, to offer 3 years on-site warranty, which is a great advantage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6322,I gonna get:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6322,Ryzen 7 4800H
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6322,16GB RAM and 512GB SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6322,GTX1650
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6322,Ti with 120Hz screen 250 nitz.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6322,"+ 2 year premium warranty supposedly the best, got promo, only +$36"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6322,"Lowest Ive gotten is $1405 using Shopback18 code,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6322,before Shopback cashback and CC points.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6322,"If you buy the base model $1299 with code, you can get as low as around $1100 or so before Shopback cashback."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6322,I still waiting for that guy to see how he got $1219 with the above setup or similar
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6323,I almost bought this too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6323,Realized the U behind the processed is slower than H version.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6323,Also the integrated GPU in the AMD processor is only on par with MX350 level.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6323,So didnt fit my needs
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6323,Then I chanced on Lenovo Legion 5
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6324,"If you are able to get an offer for the same configuration, please share and let us know"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6324,haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6324,"Cuz Lenovo has a ""Price-Match"" guarantee."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6324,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6325,So can they price match the 1219?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6325,Can show forum post
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6325,haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6325,"Also, Lenovo s540 - 4800U 13 inch coming to SG."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6325,Legion
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6325,5 - 1660ti & 2060
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6325,coming 2nd half of the year
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6326,1660Ti or more
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6326,then the price gonna be bumped up to $1800 liao maybe.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6326,Now settling on 4800H /
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6326,GTX1650
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6326,Ti is more than enough for my needs and budget.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6327,Not with promo code 15-18% off .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6327,"Likely ard 1.5k, or 150-250 more from current 1.3-1-4K"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6327,"Also, for most people 4600H / 1660ti would be better combo than 4800h/1650ti for around the same price"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6328,"Ok thanks!,i think will wait for the higher discount code as not urgently need it🙂"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6329,Thanks!!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6330,"Yep, for gaming purposes, you will need something better."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6330,"I bought this for my sis who is starting uni soon, and she don't game at all."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6330,Her priority is thin and light
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6331,1.4kg not really that light though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6331,"There are other options like asus um433, 1.1kg"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6332,Agree.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6332,"If want light, should look at Asus zenbook or Acer swift 3/ 5 or LG Gram 13"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6332,All around 1Kg
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6332,My ryzen pro 3500 so far is great for work.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6332,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6333,well.... I think Lenovo Singapore will price-match or give a better offer than local Singapore vendors
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6334,"You could have saved 100 bucks by going for the GTX 1650, instead of the Ti version."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6334,"Basically Nvidia just upgraded to the GTX 1650 to GDDR6,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6334,so I don't see a difference between the Ti and non Ti version.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6335,"Yes, but they cost more."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6335,"The Swift 3 is the cheapest, but the display is very poor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6336,Asus is the same price A lot lighter and double the storage but half the ram.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6336,"Also, the white keyboard not for everyone."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6337,"Looks decent, though I would have preferred more RAM than storage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6337,"The latter can be upgraded, but not the soldered on RAM."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6337,Actually I was reading the review for this Asus laptop version with dedicated GPU
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6337,and I kind of wonder
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6337,"which ""genius"" came out with the idea of this hidden exhaust between the hinge."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6337,Its a downright dumb design.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6337,Quite a lot of slim profile laptops come with this silly design because its almost like the vents are semi blocked.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6337,I was also worried about how the hot air coming out from it is cooking my laptop's LCD screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6338,"Thats just asus ergo lift vent, think all their zenbook push out hot air like that."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6338,Even the g14 which would be more concerning
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6339,The Asus Zenbook models cost quite a bit more ~150.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6339,And I realise they are actually shipping out with 3700U
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6339,huh??why???
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6339,"Meanwhile, the Acer Swift 3 comes with 4500U, and the warranty is 2yr Carry-in."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6339,"And as mentioned, the display is really bad."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6339,"Meanwhile, this Lenovo unit has 3yr on-site."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6339,"Display isn't great, but good enough."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6339,"And man, that 4700U smokes even Intel's i9 gaming CPU"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6340,I havent got it yet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6340,Waiting for the fella share his code.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6340,"With Shopback18 code, the diff between Ti or not is around $60-70 I think."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6341,Both Lenovo and asus cost the same -$1398
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6342,My friend's Legion 5 arrived liao.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6342,Ordered last last weekend.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6343,"Hi,Hows the performance and which promo code he used to purchase?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6344,I paid 1263 for the Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6344,"Plus, 3700U is leagues slower than 4700U, since it uses the 12nm Zen architecture."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6344,"If only, the Asus used the 4700U, then it's a no-brainer"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6345,Yours seem on discount and not sticker price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6345,You probably could get the asus for similar price after promo discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6345,Got a $1398 zenbook @ $1218 during it
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6345,show 2 years ago
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6345,The 3700U is enough for moderate user who want more storage and lighter laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6345,Theres another um433 version with 4700u + mx350
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6345,coming later.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6346,those of you who can wait....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6346,Dell USA just released a new G15 gaming laptop which is AMD ryzen 7 CPU

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6346,+ exclusive AMD Radeon™ RX 5600M 1200 USD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6347,let us know your friend's review
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6348,Errr.. I don't think Dell SG will bring in AMD desktop/laptop here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6348,"Tried to ask them in the past for Ryzen 3 series, they say they won't."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6348,bring in AMD products here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6348,Not sure whether will change or not but unlikely.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6348,So far they are the only brand that doesn't have any AMD OEM products in SG.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6348,"Asus, HP, Lenovo, Acer all have except Dell."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6348,Those interested may have to buy from Dell US store and there is way to do so.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6349,Hi all the legion has caught my eyes since it seems local g14 gonna be over priced.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6349,I'm reading on some coupon codes?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6349,What's the best deal for a full spec legion 15?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6349,Thanks alot
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6350,"G14 and legion not same category though, ~1kg weight / size difference."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6350,In terms of weight / size theres no alternative to g14 so can try to import it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6350,Or can wait for a15 with 4900H
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6351,Tbh the gtx1650/
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6351,Ti is a deal breaker.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6351,"If you really into gaming, you would wanna wait till the gtx1660Ti or rtx2060 be available."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6351,Else you pretty much have to sacrifice a lot of graphics settings just to play smoothly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6351,Apart from that the fast 144hz is ok but not meant for editing photos.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6351,But the way if you gonna have the 144hz panel you must reconsider if the gtx1650Ti is even able to produce that many frames for it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6351,Which imo not easy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6352,seems like bestbuy is the only option for R9 specced.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6352,looks like the best value as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6352,"bestbuy USD1,450 - 4900HS / 16"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6352,GB / 1TB / RTX 2060 MQ.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6352,"5cgo SGD2,258 - 4800HS / 16GB / 1TB / GTX 1660 Ti"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6353,For those interested.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6353,GTX1650 versus the Ti version.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6353,"Personally, seems like can run most games smoothly and comfortably."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6353,Good enough for me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6353,In real world diff in prices
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6353,its like around $60-70.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6354,Shows how overpriced SG version is for 4600 / 1650 @
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6354,$2.5k
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6354,Asus SG still think economy very good
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6355,Seem like its 1650 gddr 5 version though
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6356,"Other than ezbuy, any other recommended forwarder to check out for US to SG?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6357,Some scores for my friend's Legion 5 4800H GTX 1650:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6357,Cinebench R20: 4329 default settings out of box
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6357,Crystaldiskmark:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6357,3570R
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6357,2982W
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6357,SSD is a good one...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6357,512
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6357,GB Samsung PM981a
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6357,Didn't ask him to run other tests.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6357,He said the laptop doesn't feel hot or noisy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6358,And the one we are getting for Legion 5 is DDR6 so should be slightly better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6359,Which would make the jump to 1650ti less worth it
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6360,"If that is smooth, i think you might really reconsider."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6360,The frames were between 30+ to 40+ FPS range average.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6360,To play really smoothly you will need to push down more graphic settings to make it 60FPS to be smooth.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6360,Then this is for current gen of games.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6360,"Next gen worth of games come in, you got to change a new laptop??"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6360,Lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6360,Get somewhere mid tier gtx1660ti and rtx2060.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6366,The only forwarders I can think of is comgateway or Vpost.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6366,"If u got singpost stand chart credit card, Vpost got discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6367,When will the 1660ti be out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6367,My main purpose of the laptop is to use on bed when nuaing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6367,Play some games once a while.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6367,Big titles leave it for desktop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6367,So after seeing g14 1k+ more I might as well save the 1k buy a legion then use the savings for a new gpu.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6368,"Q2 2020, no exact date though."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6368,Watched
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6368,"some reviews from china said that SSD for legion 5 no guarantee is pm981a, depend on lottery luck."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6369,Hmmmm seems like both promo code thankyou or shopback last day is tmr thinking hoot or dont
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,If they can charge $100 for a gtx1650 to gtx1650Ti.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,Im very sure the gtx1660Ti will cost a lot more.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,Rtx2060 lagi
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,no need to think.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,Should be a premium of $400 or more.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,The downside is the 60hz if people want a 100% sRGB screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,Else a 144Hz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,if they only wanna game.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,If really wanna compare.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,The legion 5 all out specs should be very close to $2k-ish.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,Also g14 is something of a different league.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,It is small and lightweight.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,Unlike the Legion 5 which is a massive 2.5kg laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,I think it is best to wait awhile more and see what has to offer ba.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,Legion 5 is promising.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,"But lack in screen specs, graphics card specs now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6370,Also the weight can be a concern for some.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6371,"After ""lurking"" here for quite some time , finally pull the plug on the Legion 5 this afternoon with some haggling with the rep with the Shopback18 discount code and an additional 2%."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6371,Finally got the follow spec at 1380.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6381,Oh... Didn't know that.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6381,I don't think we can buy direct from the lenovo china site right?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6396,how to know if still available
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6397,R7 4800H / 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD / GTX1650 Ti / 120Hz screen / Promo upgrade to 2 years on site premium care
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6397,Lowest
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6397,it can go with Shopback18 is $1405.50 before CC rebate and Shopback 5% cashback.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6397,Before code is around $1706.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6398,"Means you need to max out the Legion 5 and buy 1TB SSD then apply code maybe have more than $1500 to get the free Xbox, assuming not snapped up yet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6399,the xbox doesnt appear in the cart...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6399,dont even know if still have anot
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6400,You need use they live
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6400,chat
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6400,cos they will give you the code
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6400,btw
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6400,"they giving  free Lenovo Legion M200 RGB Gaming Mouse, 2Y Premium Care with Onsite upgrade from 1Y Depot/CCI, Lenovo Legion 15.6-inch Recon Gaming Backpack, Lenovo Original powerbank 5000mAH"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6401,"If those items are checked before you click customize, they make the base price jump from 1299 to near 1400, even before you change the cpu/ram others options."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6401,Not sure if they really free.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6402,You talk so much about getting a good deal end up
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6402,dont wanna
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6402,share the code or its a code that cannot be shared.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6402,Waste people time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6403,Waste whose time ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6403,Yours ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6403,"If I can really afford to share, I definitely will,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6403,"but obviously I can't because the promo code is individual sales agent limited, meaning to say each sales agent can only have that limited amount of people using and quote the sales person ID."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6403,Any more they sales agent  will have a hard time to answer for it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6403,"My point to bring across is the promo codes you guys received from the live chat chaps are not the best and you can only continue to request for the ultimate code and hopefully one of the agent with sufficient "" slot"" can afford to share with you."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6403,"Once again, I did post up my deal and offering for anybody to take over at cost and someone managed to snap it up before you did, so please don't be mad."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6403,Cheers
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6404,Not mad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6404,The diff isnt big to me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6404,I got 2 units ytd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6404,But you share like never share.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6404,And you still dont get it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6404,Its
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6404,like when I buy a new Mercedes then I quickly go car forum and tell people I got it 10% lower cost than everyone else nett price
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6404,but actually not a repeatable deal.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6404,Next time such things you keep quiet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6405,"In your context of mercedes, instead of what you have presented,  it is more of like me sharing there are better promo codes"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6405,and you guys need to continue to dig more.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6405,It is a repeatable deal if you can get the agent to disclose to you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6405,Obviously I ain't an agent else I would have love to share with everybody to earn the comms.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6405,Next time read carefully and don't 以小人之心度君子之腹
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6406,So whats the % discount that the agent gave you?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6406,If people know then everyone can just keep trying to get an agent that can give them that % discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6407,"legion got 2.5"" i want no 2.5"" slot becos its waste of space."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6407,"I saw ideapad 5 14"" version, i considering it.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6407,but i wanna see if there's any other option.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6407,Seem like ryzen laptop still not many.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6408,Any comments on this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6409,lenovo said as long as banner still there xbox promotion still on
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6410,"Other than the guy who reserved your paid set, no one else benefited from your sharing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6410,So next time just shut up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6411,Is this the best combination now i can only make it to 1405.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6411,They are not able to give me further discount ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6411,i am looking actually.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6411,my 10 yrs old alienware is going to give up on me anytime soon .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6411,also comparing with aftershock forge 15s
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6412,This the internal for Ideapad 5 Ryzen 15inch:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6413,imo just max spec it with the 1tb ssd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6413,it ends up at 1520.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6413,purchase now with a free xbox one s which u can discard later for around 300
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6414,u dont spec the 1tb ssd u wont hit 1.5k for free xbox
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6415,will be 1577 after i spec the 1tb .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6415,is 1 tb really necessary?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6415,cause the first HD was already 1 tb.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6416,imo dont spec the hdd?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6416,just spec the 1tb ssd and its already 1520
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6417,bro can check your pm?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6418,The discount I gotten was from one CSO rep whom I mentioned that I have the shopback18 promo discount code
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6418,and if they were to provide me another 2% discount from the cart I will order it immediately.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6418,Hence this price and the rep manual override the cart price from their end.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6419,"Got one CSO mentioned they additional 2% off is case by case basis, based on specs you chose."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6419,If you max it out then the deal is too good then likely their manager
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6419,wont approve the 2% adjustment.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6419,So $1405.50 is the best if you want Max CPU RAM GPU and 512GB SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6419,Before CC/Shopback rebate.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6419,If you drop the Ti version for GPU
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6419,I think it goes to $1323 or so.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6419,"Some say the Ti version not worth, only 5-8% faster or more FPS."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6419,Above is all including the 2 year premium onsite care.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6420,the honor magicbook sold in malaysia

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6420,"keyboard is the TKL type [meaning no dedicated Page Up / Page Down keys, no dedicated number pad], type-c port doesn't support display out."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6421,Around 25%-30% I think
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6422,Moving on 🍇

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6426,Anyone ordered the Legion 5 successfully with 2 SSDs?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6426,The CSO telling me now that it can only take 1 HDD and 1 SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6426,but not 2 SSDs.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6428,"Yup, there is."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6429,My order with 2 SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6430,"if u dun mind the small batt, at that price is quite worth it"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6431,Yea that's my screen as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6431,Will just go ahead and try my luck.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6431,Hopefully won't change the specs after payment
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6432,Thanks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6432,I placed an order for it today.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6433,izzit ok to leave the first slot HD as dummy and use the 2nd slot for 512 SSD ?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6437,decided to go on this setup @$1313.10
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6437,before 5% shopback
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6438,"Hi,if using promo code not from shopback still eligible for the cashback?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6439,Wrong concept.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6439,2280 has more space to distribute heat as it is longer vs 2242 version.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6440,170Watt power supply.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6440,This laptop sure taking up lots of power.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6441,It is true that 2280 have more space for better heat distribution.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6441,"The first time I used a 2242 NVME drive that came with my IdeaPad 5, I was shocked how hot it is."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6441,"At idle, you probably see like 50+ degs, and even with gaming load, its hitting 81 degs and throttling."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6441,This is despite me adding a copper heatspread to it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6441,"None of the 2280 NVME drive ever hit this sorts of temp, with 50+ being the highest I've seen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6441,"When I was cloning this drive to a new Adata SSD, I placed a ramsink on the 2242 drive, and it was scorching hot to the touch."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6442,"This is a gaming grade laptop, so not unexpected that the power supply is higher."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6442,"In fact, I feel whether it really consumes that much power or not, I rather they provide a higher waltage power supply just in case."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6442,This should give the CPU more power for short term boost.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6442,My guess is that the full power draw may end up peaking around 150W based on the specs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6443,What coupon to get that price?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6444,I believe that coupon has expired.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6444,Was for may.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6445,This price KYM?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6446,Should be Shopback18.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6446,So far its better than THANKYOU with CSO ref number or LENOVOPRO

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6447,"I think for this price, getting from Lenovo SG would be better well worth it due to the warranty support"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6448,So did you buy also?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6449,Anyway why did you give it up?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6449,You upgrade to another gaming laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6450,Yep ordered also.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6450,After all discount with rebate is 1.4k full specs 1tb with 1650ti.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6450,Then xbox also
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6451,"Hi,you qualify for the xbox?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6452,"Err.. careful, laptop/desktop from China comes with Chinese OS."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6453,Nope.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6453,Actually I check my quote again
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6453,it was $1372 after talking to CSO

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6457,Ti to 1650..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6457,the diff actually is around $60.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6457,Diff in performance/FPS can be as low as 5% or as much as 15%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6458,Ah sorry so i am confused i opt for $10 should be better ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6458,Or no lol so my screen now is what hz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6458,Sent from Realme RMX1931 using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6459,You add $10 to get 100% sRGB 60Hz Screen with brighter screen.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6460,Yours is fine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6460,60Hz and brighter with 100% sRGB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6460,I wanna try high refresh rate because haven't tested before
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6460,so I settled for the base screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6461,So weird they opt high refresh rate as cheaper
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6461,then 60hz .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6461,Should have done my home work

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6462,or Ti is not gonna make the 144hz panel looks good either.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6463,I chose the 60Hz coz
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6463,I want the 100% srgb and brighter screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6463,Anyways none of the gpu can do 120hz beautifully

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6474,Bought the Lenovo Xiaoxin 13 Pro for 4999RMB 1000SGD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6474,"4800U, 16GB, 512GB PCIE SSD, QHD 100% sRGB screen, dual fans, dual heatpipes."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6474,"Only annoying thing is the lack of HDMI port, so have to use USB-C adapter."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6475,Asus SG too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6475,Likely decision was made much earlier before new ryzen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6475,so the new ryzen have to wait for next refresh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6476,Can share the link and how you buy?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6476,What's the estimated delivery date?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6479,"According to my order details, they promise to ship out no later than 13 June."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6479,Bought via Taobao Lenovo Tmall.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6479,"They ran out of the 4800U, but I've noticed that there will occasionally be a few units being restocked."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6480,Still a good buy la
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6480,Sent from Rem Best Grill using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6481,Lol what other option with 4600H/4800H at that price?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6481,Close alternative is upcoming asus a15
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6481,The only reason to wait would be for legion 5 to release with better graphics 1660ti / 2060
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6482,I thought they have been selling this since last year?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6482,Why become new launch?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6484,I am looking forward to 4000 series too!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6485,Read again.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6486,No one look at the Eluktronics Ryzen option?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6486,They will be shipping from July.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6486,So far I am keen looking at T14 or this.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6487,Eluktronics sell in SG?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6487,If need import warranty an issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6488,They shipped to Singapore according to their website and new egg selling too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6488,Only worried about support.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6489,they are using OEM chassis right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6489,might as well wait for aftershock.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6490,Or you can consider checking with Aftershock to see if they will bring in the same chassis and specs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6490,"If they are going to at some point, then no harm waiting."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6491,With aftershock then need include markup
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6492,T14 -.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6492,T14s -.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6492,X13 -.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6492,wonder which screen is the best option for T14. 14.0
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6492,""" FHD 1920x1080Low Power IPS Anti-glare - 400 nits"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6492,16:9 800:1 72% 170°
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6492,"14.0""FHD 1920x1080 ThinkPad Privacy Guard IPS Anti-glare Multitouch 500 nits"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6492,16:9 1000:1 72% 170°
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6492,These two should be the best option.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6492,alas..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6492,no 100 percent?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6492,These two option the laptop will also be lighter
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6493,"The 72% probably refers to NTSC gamut, so equivalent to 100% sRGB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6494,good that lenovo didnt nerf the amd variants so badly
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6494,next qn will be if the amd price will be more competitive?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6495,Hope it's more competitive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6495,The question is when it will reach sg.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6495,The psref only got 8gb config available for t14 and x13 in Singapore
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6496,500 nits is very bright.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6496,"Even for outdoor usage, I feel a 400 nits brightness should be more than enough."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6497,Content creation needs a brighter screen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6498,More than enough vs more the merrier.....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6498,Then why need HDR 1000?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6498,If got options.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6498,I'd choose more.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6498,And dial back if needed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6499,really?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6499,wha..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6499,heng ah!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6499,come on lenovo sg!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6499,where issit!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6500,"500 nits come with privacy screen, which affects brightness somewhat."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6500,"Otherwise, High nits is more for HDR support"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6501,Dunno man..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6501,i gave up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6501,Decided to keep my XPS 13 3 replacement set instead of selling.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6501,It better not appear on Lenovo store tonight. ..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6502,the multitouch and privacy is tempting
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6503,Hopefully by mid june appear
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6504,Higher nits important.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6504,I use my t495s for indoor presentation
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6504,is manageable
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6504,"but once I bring to trade shows, outdoor etc"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6504,it's still very dim at max brightness
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6504,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6505,In Russian but most people bought this specs
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6506,stupid question..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6506,when is multitouch useful??
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6507,sometimes its really just easy to touch compared to moving the mouse.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6507,This is something that after you use after awhile than u will find it useful.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6507,Requires you to switch your workflow and muscle memory.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6508,I find touch screen and multi touch to be essential.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6508,Especially when i read Journal in PDF.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6508,something its better to just pinch to zoom.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6508,Often i just carry my laptop without a mouse
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6508,so touch screen is just a bonus that i need.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6509,I used to carry a mouse
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6509,but then I graduated from having a mouse.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6509,I think i can survive w/o a mouse as long as the trackpad is good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6509,"So if that's the case , multitouch will be a good add-on?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6509,"But recently when I WFH, I went back to keyboard + mouse because I have an ext kb."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6509,But I think I'm ok w/o a mouse
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6510,"Multitouch is important if u use ur laptop to read newspaper, magazine, books and etc"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6511,"I'm using the spectre x360 from 2016, that why i was hoping for the AMD Envy"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6511,x360.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6511,So reliant on touch screen and portrait mode to read Journal and coding
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6511,"Cant believe until HP decide to chop carrot with us
."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6511,I pity those who aren't well informed about the old AMD CPU that bought the machine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6511,I'm considering Lenovo Flex 5
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6511,but their screen is not sRGB...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6511,any other machine anyone can recommend?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6512,Hp isn't cheating anyone...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6512,The envy model you are talking about has been sold in stores for many months now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6512,I guess it's the first time they are selling the 16gb model on their official store
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6512,so they call it new launch.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6512,Wait a month or two and probably the new Envy
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6512,x360 will launch here
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6513,"Same with Asus Sg, SG market get leftovers and take very long to come."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6514,"Whoever interested in Lenovo laptop, shoback increased"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6514,it's cashbacks from 5% to 12% only for today
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6514,I think
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6515,"Yes, upsized shopback only today"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6516,Oh youre right.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6516,"I found an old HWZ news, 12 July 2019, the current HP Envy x360 has being out for a few months almost a year."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6516,But why the new launch?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6516,.So should also expect around July for the 4000 series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6516,Damn... still got hope.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6516,If by August still not out yet i really must jump ship liao.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6516,School term starting and my current spectre battery and occasional BSOD really bugging me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6517,"Lenovo now has Ideapad and E-series which users can configure online, not bad."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6517,Don see HP
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6517,", Acer have this self-config option."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6518,Hi guys!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6518,"Newbie here, I've been lurking on this thread for quite sometime now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6518,I found this thread informative.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6518,I just want to ask if someone here ordered at Lenovo site a Legion laptop and got a free xbox?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6518,Did you receive a confirmation e-mail about the free xbox or it is included on the confirmation e-mail of the laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6518,"Today I ordered a Legion amd and asked a rep if the promo for the free xbox is still ongoing and he said ""yes still have""."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6518,So I finally pulled the trigger and get the Legion Amd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6518,"After purchase, I only get the confirmation e-mail regarding the laptop but no info for my free xbox."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6518,Anyone can share their experience ordering at lenovo site?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6519,Hey all who ordered last week.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6519,Have u all received the estimated shipping date.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6519,Mine is 19Jun
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6520,Ordered mine on the 24th of May and received today.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6520,Haven't done much with it yet except opening it up to slot in another SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6520,It does comes with a dummy SATA HDD cage and the SATA connector.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6520,Removing the cage and the connector reveals the 2nd NVME slot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6520,The slot is slightly raised so double sided NVME will be ok.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6520,Not sure about the main slot as I did not touch that.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6521,"cool, 2 weeks !"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6522,Not sure if the combinations of the specs affected the speed of the delivery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6522,I believe it was estimating the delivery time to be between 4 to 6 weeks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6522,When I swapped the graphics card to the 1650TI
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6522,it went down to just 4 weeks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6523,so total there are 2 m2 slots?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6523,one from factory and the other slot being m2 or sata?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6524,that's very fast
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6524,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6525,I opted for the 256GB 2280 SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6525,The intention was to swap it out with a 512GB 2280 SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6525,but since there's another slot there
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6525,so I just kept the 256GB in and slot in the other SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6525,The other slot is definitely NVME and not the SATA one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6526,disc code:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6526,LIMITEDTIME.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6526,just chat with CSO for latest disc code.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6528,"The CSO mention we only get a email confirmation regarding the Xbox, when our laptop is delivered to us."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6529,No idea why
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6529,but i go back to shopback and make another transaction with today 12% cashback .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6529,So now i purchase at $1313.10 - 12% shopback total $1155.53
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6529,but my shipping went to 6-8 weeks intial
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6529,was 4-6
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6529,i guess too much deman.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6546,means yoga is lifestyle?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6546,so better to just get T series or Yoga?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6562,so far of all laptop i used..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6562,thinkpad most solid.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6562,if you don't mind the rather business look.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6563,Yeah I got the cashback.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6563,There was a prompt on my Google Chrome browser saying Cashback activated or something when I landed on Lenovo site via Shopback site.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6564,Mine still shows June 19 shipping.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6564,Deliver by 25 June.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6564,I think I ordered earlier than you by a few days.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6564,"Well personally, if received within 3-4 weeks not bad"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6564,la.. at least not 6-8 weeks as stated.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6565,how long did the cashback reflect ?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6582,if got touch screen doesn't mean we need to have turn the laptop around right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6582,a lot of premium because of this feature?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6583,Is this different?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6584,it's #4614
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6585,Yea thinking of buying 32gb kit to own Self install
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6586,"JUst to check, if I wanna buy the WWAN, is it too late if I already have the laptop?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6586,X395 user.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6587,"If you didn't configure it with WWAN when ordering, it's unlikely that the antennae are built-in."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6587,"Not impossible to then get them,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6587,"but you'll have to disassemble the laptop to install the antennae, since they are usually mounted next to the screen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6587,And of course buy the WWAN card and slot it in.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6587,No issue for this portion.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6588,Already more then 2 days from shopback no response.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6588,Send them a ticket
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6588,and they told me I did click the link but not capture.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6590,Non gaming

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6591,Who else brought from shopback and the discount haven came in yet ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6591,Better file a report .
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6591,Cause they check my click activity

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6592,Woohoo looks like laptop will be shipped out next week.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6593,Possible for amd 4700u with mx350 configuration soon?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6593,Right now don't think I have seen any amd laptops with nvidia graphics in sg.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6594,unlikely they will pair this combo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6594,since the 4700u already got
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6594,gpu equivalent to a mx150/mx250.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6594,putting a mx350 is bo hua.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6594,hoping we see a 4800 u with
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6594,1660TI.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6594,now that would be pretty interesting.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6595,If you are talking about the AMD 3rd gen ryzen..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6595,then yeah
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6595,I also don't see many AMD gaming laptops in 2019...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6595,the 4th gen 4000H and U series is different.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6595,For 4000U...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6595,Probably only Asus Zenbook might have the option to add a mx350.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6595,Other than that...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6595,the rest of the lineups are mainly ultraportable with integrated Vega
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6595,For 4000H we have more options...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6595,There's Lenovo legion 5
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6595,is AMD + Nvidia gtx
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6595,Asus Zephyrus G15
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6595,Hopefully we will see Dell G5 15 and land in Singapore
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6595,too AMD processor + AMD Graphics
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6595,I also looking forward to the new Acer nitro 5 with AMD + Nvidia rtx
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6595,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6596,Mx350 is still a lot faster than mx150.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6596,Rather have the extra leg room for gpu
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6597,Ah... I think I have the same problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6597,Only record click activity but not transaction
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6598,"New Zenbook is with mx350.
."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6599,"10W version leh, this gpu already entry enough still cut down might as well not be there."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6600,"Still better than igpu even if only by a bit, still better than nothing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6600,Not like without dgpu price will be cheaper anyway.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6601,>
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6601,>
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6601,SO it it minimally need to be >300 then
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6601,is 'ho say' ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6601,Nit picking
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6601,"Brightness is important for mobile devices like laptops, smartphones, and tablets."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6601,"Most devices have a glossy display to enhance contrast, but the gloss makes reflections an issue in bright rooms or outdoors."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6601,These reflections can only be defeated by a bright display.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6601,The nit is the standard unit of luminance used to describe various sources of light.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6601,A higher rating means a brighter display.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6601,Displays for laptops and mobile devices are usually between 200 and 300 nits on average.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6601,A rating over 300 nits is solid and a rating above 500 nits is extremely good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6601,"Only a few devices can put out that much light, though as HDR and OLED laptops become more common, thats changing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6601,Apples MacBooks are known for having the brightest screens on a laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6601,Its 13-inch MacBook Pro we reviewed had a screen that maxed out at 548 nits.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6601,"Televisions are a different story, and the brightest go north of 1,000 nits."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6602,Wont
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6602,the it be distracting for the bottom part to be 10-15% dimmer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6602,Using it in max brightness then you see the bottom part dimmer will be weird.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6603,indeed there is... but issit worth it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6603,"Like the article said.. losing 20-30 percent of performance ..
if you really need gaming prowess.. get a laptop with 1660ti or 1650ti."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6603,g14 or razer stealth better option?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6603,hopefully someone reviews the mechrevo one..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6603,that one is certainly interesting
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6603,... wonder if can match mx350 ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6604,can consider this.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6604,6gb rtx 2060
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6605,"this all oem, so just wait for local brand."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6606,1660ti laptops are like 2x the weight.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6606,"Laptops at 1.2kg are all thermally restricted which affects the performance, you have to get premium models to have better thermal management."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6607,"If you willing to pay a premium, definately not 2x and thermals will do better?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6607,otherwise ya..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6607,i agree asus mx350 will fit your budget and requirements
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6607,"still i digress, waiting for T14"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6608,"For g14, dont buy from Asus Sg as its overly inflated."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6608,"Importing it is significantly cheaper, plus asus has international warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6609,yea agreed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6610,to have a dedicated graphics for an ultrabook like Asus Zenbook is a huge bonus.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6610,many ultrabooks don't have dedicated graphics.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6610,even if they have its either mx150 or mx250.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6610,for the price of a Zenbook + mx350
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6610,and you are just gonna leave it at home....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6610,imo can already go for amd gaming laptop like lenovo Legion 5
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6611,lenovo got international ma?????

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6615,My Laptop is to travel with me... light and good price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6616,seems like lenovo xiaoxin is quite good
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6617,Wah tempted but I'm worried that there's no international warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6618,There isn't any.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6618,And for the price of Rmb 4999 about 1K SGD it is nearly impossible find a online retailer that have stock.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6618,This is one of the two SG version.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6618,Price wise will probably not be comparable to the Tiong version whenIF they arrive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6618,"Alternative will be the Yoga Slim 7, but based on psref lenovo, SG will not get the 4800U version of Yoga Slim 7."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6677,"Not possible, they have a pattern to come out with the Intel version first."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6678,Too bad Legion 5 with R7 4800H does not have GTX1660
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6678,"Ti or RTX2060, only GTX1650 Ti."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6678,"Else, it will sell like hotcakes like Asus A15 or G14."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6680,I think this is where Intel wins
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6680,The more premium gaming laptops are still Intel
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6680,"Even the 17"" version of legion 5 is Intel not AMD"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6680,"If AMD is able to work on their 5th gen, 6th gen, 7th gen to be still within the 7nm range"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6680,I think more companies will be willing to support AMD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6680,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6681,Yup.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6681,can't wait

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6684,Legion 5 AMD can get free Xbox?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6684,Any min purchase price?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6684,The website list only for model Y540.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6684,Any one who bought Legion 5 AMD get free xbox?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6685,"You can check with the customer support chat, previously was min order of 1.5K"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6686,Yeah same here.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6686,Hope the date shift earlier some more
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6687,I hope this will change in AMDs
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6687,favour next year onwards..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6687,Both the 4000 series laptop and desktop chips are giving intel a good run for its money.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6687,Such competition can only benefit us.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6688,"hopefully their ""graphics"" side also do well.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6688,if not likely we gonna remain stuck with low end gpu?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6689,"If talk about mid or high end laptops, where will only have iGPU from AMD.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6689,confirm have discrete GPU de.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6690,Bought gen 1 and gen 2 amd now waiting for gen 3.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6690,Don't know whether to get legion or ThinkPad
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6691,A bit out of topic but related to ryzen processor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6691,Is there any usb 3.0 driver for amd 3200u?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6691,My acer laptop usb 3.0 cannot detect some usb 3.0 device like thumbdrive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6691,It just show the device but unable to access.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6691,The usb device is working fine on other pc.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6691,I update the bios and amd chipset driver also same.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6692,if the usb device is working fine and your port is unable..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6692,could be the port
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6692,is dmg?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6693,Better use GIVINGUP as soon as you can.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6693,The excessive usage of this premium code have been flagged Out to the management ...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6693,it is only matter of time 😭
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6694,Wouldnt management prefer higher sales.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6694,Discounts not their money anyway
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6694,and it helps their kpi.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6695,How do you know this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6696,Both Intel and AMD uses Microsoft USB 3.0 driver that comes with.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6696,Windows
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6696,8.1/10.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6696,Only Windows 7 than need to install USB 3.0 driver since Win 7.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6696,doesn't support USB 3.0 natively.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6696,"Could be OS corrupted or malware, if you know how to reinstall OS."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6696,than try first.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6696,If after OS is reinstall and same thing than it is motherboard issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6697,anyhow pomp.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6697,pls la
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6697,", you think  discounts can be given till they make a loss?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6697,all this pre-agreed upon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6697,"and the larger the number of orders, the bigger the discounts, cos they save on shipping and bulk orders."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6697,brainless is one thing...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6697,spreading false inform is worse.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6698,"For one, I didnt mention using the promo code will incur loss for Lenovo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6698,Thats your assumption.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6698,"For two, how do you even know"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6698,this is pre-agreed upon on ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6698,Thats again your assumption.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6698,"For three, well, spread false information?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6698,How do you tell an information is false ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6698,Are you a Lenovo staff ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6698,Else just shut your assumption and your mouth.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6698,"And lastly, I am definitely not a Lenovo staff"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6698,but I do have friend working under Lenovo sales.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6698,Brainless is for those people who assume much.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6698,Retarded.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6699,Lenovo can keep all the stock to themselves if they think they can sell a lots lots of unit without any sales with a graphic card that is a generation behind.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6699,"We are helping them to clear their old stock, especially true when it comes to gaming!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6700,I wont disagree with this!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6700,"And indeed without the promo codes, Lenovo wont be able to sell as much quantities as they like to right now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6701,"and there is not reason to limit the screen options compared to intel same version, unless they get a bigger cut selling intel version."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6701,"intel: 60Hz, 300 nits, 100% sRGB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6701,"120Hz, 250 nits, 45% sRGB."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6701,Dolby Vision HDR.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6701,amd:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6701,"60Hz, 300 nits, 100% sRGB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6701,"120Hz, 250 nits, 45% sRGB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6702,The intention to give promotion is to boost sales.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6702,Goals to reach a certain % of sales already planned.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6702,They won't stop it until the intended date is over.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6702,It also combo with shopback promo on 14th June
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6702,"Furthermore, now is GSS period."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6702,But if they decide to chut pattern and deactivate the discount code...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6702,Then for me as a consumer...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6702,It's a very simple choice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6702,I don't buy lor
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6702,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6703,For #2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6703,"When a business runs a promo campaign, usually the projected revenue and number of units to be sold is all done and agreed upon with stocks allocated for."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6703,So either this is wrong info being spread around or lame marketing gimmick to create sense of urgency for customers to quickly commit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6704,1 selling at cost 0 profit better than loss.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6704,and that's what they usually do to prevent further loss.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6704,2
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6704,selling at loss on the hardware and overselling support is a common way they recover think of printers and cartridges.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6704,they sell printers at a huge loss and make back from the ink
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6705,Lazada got MSI GF65 with RTX2060 selling for $800.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6705,Possible???
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6706,unlikely?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6706,got link?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6707,Wrong info.. ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6707,Go try out GIVINGUP now and tell me whats
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6707,the % of discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6707,"Btw, wanna know why GIVINGUP got flagged out to management?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6707,Think back why I did emphasis AGENT ID is extremely important
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6708,i try givingup now only get 5%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6708,did i miss the train?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6709,I think you're extremely rude to call someone retard when you yourself sound so retarded.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6709,the cost of manufacturing is usually 1/4 of the retail price and the rest of unit profit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6709,Of course there marketing etc that they need to cover.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6709,The discount is one part of the marketing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6709,Also how do you even know this was flagged?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6709,Stop spreading false information.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,And it is not rude to call someone brainless out of no where?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,How do I even know the promo code was flagged out?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,Lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,"Sir, please kindly scroll up and read carefully."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,And why are you talking about marketing and manufacturing cost now?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,You are completely out of context right now!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,Obviously promo codes are part of the marketing but it is limited for selective customers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,"When the system receive excessive order of customers using the exclusive code without the agent ID, this is a clear sign that this exclusive code have been leaked to the public."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,Thats when the management decide to remove the discount %.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,"And btw, did you even try out the promo code GIVINGUP before commenting about false information ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,"Look guys, my message here is clear."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,"There Are exclusive codes around, but you need to obtain directly from the agentprovided he is willing to give you."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,I provided internal news that the promo code will be restricted soon
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,so do purchase
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,ASAP
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,"But instead of anything I am being called waste of time, brainless by some of the adults here."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6710,"Sure, so be it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6711,"If true, then you told us after the code is flagged."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6711,What's the point?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6711,Just leave it and end the argument.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6711,"Someone said it's 1 month promo, now it's actually fake?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6712,"Well, why should i listen to you when you sound so retarded and aggressive in the first place."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6712,And yet you have not answer the question.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6712,"So what if it agent id, do you work at shopback?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6712,At least be a little considerate.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6713,LOL.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6713,No one ask you to listen to me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6713,I am posting my internal news from Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6713,No one force you to believe whatever I say.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6713,But please do let me know how will you feel And react when someone call you brainless.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6714,Definitely not me who said it is a 1 month promo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6714,The point is to use the code ASAP before the % are cut or removed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6714,Is it so hard to tell ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6715,Promotion code GIVINGUP is useless now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6715,"I plan to log order on tomorrow, but likely buy ASUS A15 now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6715,Bye bye Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6716,When you tell us the promo is no more.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6716,Kong jiao wei.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6717,Look for seller eunms898.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6717,New seller.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6717,No rating yet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6718,Kong your head.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6719,Ks1991 is correct.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6719,GIVINGUP discount went from 25% to 5%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6719,"I still hope 25% will resurface sometime tomorrow, but hope is low."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6719,"I should bought the Legion on yesterday, but late, haha!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6720,Pm me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6720,Let me help you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6721,Many fake sellers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6721,Be very careful.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6721,I have seen many accounts banned and reappear.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6721,"Shopback, shopback1, shopback2."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6721,It can never happen and it will never happen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6722,"Calm down guys, Ks was just trying to inform others that the 25% code was ending soon as there were some who were planning to wait for the higher cashback tomorrow."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6722,Turned out what he said was indeed true.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6722,"For those who are about to buy, just note that if you choose 2 SSDs, the battery indeed becomes 80wh instead of 60wh."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6722,The CSO told me it was a bug but turned out what he said wasn't true.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6722,1 SSD + dummy/HDD will make it 60wh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6722,I tried appealing for my shopback cash back but was unsuccessful in the end btw.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6722,The click was registered but not the purchase itself.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6723,Is it too late to cancel the order and reorder again ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6724,It only means the allocated stocks or projected number of units to be moved for this campaign under this promo code has been reached.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6724,Nothing more.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6724,"Lenovo not a Kaciamputeh biz leh, where got promo codes redeem until the biz buay tahan one."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6724,"Thats all I can say, I got nothing against you"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6724,Ks so chill
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6725,Damn.. was planning to purchase it tomorrow together with shopback promo
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6725,.. sigh
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6726,Me too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6726,It only means I will be 1.3k richer by not buying laptop on tomorrow.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6727,Haha yea ordered on 31st May and laptop already arrived.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6727,Usually don't have issues with
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6727,shopback cause
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6727,I'll kiasu close everything and reopen to make sure it registers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6727,It's ok
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6727,I guess
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6727,haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6727,quite a good deal with the 18% off itself
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6727,anw
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6728,"Wait for national day and see any good offer, maybe more options from other brands too by then."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6729,60 to 80 is quite a huge difference.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6729,if 80...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6729,this would be one of the best budget gaming laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6729,at least so far released.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6808,I keyed in Rep ID box.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6808,Not sure correct or not.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6808,Ya
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6808,no price different.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6808,Bro Yusoff confirmed both work together.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6808,Keep my fingers cross.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6809,So the cons for this Legion 5 is that it cannot be charged with USB C right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6810,Any idea if there is a minimum spending for both promos to work?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6811,No USB C charging.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6812,u will get within 2h
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6813,May I know how much did you spent?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6814,yay more people in the legion family
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6814,haha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6814,anybody planning to self upgrade to 32gb ram?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6815,"If you are not doing video editing or 3D, no point upgrading."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6816,Rep ID is needed else
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6816,CS will email you to check where did you get the code from.. and the transaction might be voided.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6816,😎
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6817,Lenovo pissing around with soldered RAM on current Thinkpads are the reason holding me back from ever buying a new one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6817,It is simply bullsh*t for the T490s/X390 and all their AMD variants to have all-soldered RAM when Dell's 7300 has.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6817,TWO.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6817,replaceable RAM slots.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6817,It looks like my only path is to upgrade from T460s to T480s.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6817,Or hope when Dell/Lenovo finally get their act together and release a 16:10 laptop with at least 1 RAM slot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6818,So i keyed in REP ID is correct?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6889,If want gtx1660ti or rtx2060.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6889,Why dont buy asus a15.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6889,More worth it at 1.6k for rtx2060.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6889,Gtx1650 and 1650Ti is really for normal indie games or some light esports title.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6890,Bad thermal that result in loud fan due to blocked vent.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6890,Asus design it that way
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6890,"cause of product segmentation, to help sell their premium models."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6890,"Also, subpar screen color"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6891,the 4800H very powderful.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6891,at 100% cpu about 20k cpumark.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6891,for normal use can limit max cpu usage at power options to 50% so it runs cooler.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6892,"For shopback, anyone can advise how long does it takes to show the rebate in the apps?"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6915,n opted to add the 2nd nvme to get 80wh battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6916,Very confusing leh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6916,cso
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6916,i spoke to say need Monday to confirm if xbox is available.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6916,so i hold my brake.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6917,not sure why got dbl standard
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6917,but i emailed the transcript to myself
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6917,just incase
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6917,they chut stunt.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6918,if cso dare to promise u got
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6918,xbox.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6918,make sure you email and cc yourself for dispute in future
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6919,"end of day, if lenovo came back and say no more, and i kick up a fuss, it may mean the cso kenna or fork the difference."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6919,"like some say, no point breaking another rice bowl"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6920,Type LENOVO18 and not Lenovo18.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6920,There are better discount out there for today only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6921,quite true also maybe cso just promise so that you can make the purchase asap
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6922,"actually, they have a lot of Xbox, not just 50."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6922,"Over the last few days one CSO tell me last one, u order now, i reserve for you!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6922,"Today one just confirm got many, sure no problem."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6922,"They are clearing for the next gen console coming in Nov, so no scared no stock."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6922,"If u can sell the Xbox off at 300 bucks, u actually exceed the 25% discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6922,"No one was giving me any codes, so i was halfway through creating one that is 1515 dollars  similar to yours  because with that, u get 12% shopback off 1515 dollars = $ 181."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6922,If you use credit card 1.5% rebate = $22.75.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6922,"Sell xbox = off $300 of cse, involve some risk and effort"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6922,End up 1515 - 22.75- 300-181 = $1011
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6922,Vs 25% off + shopback code 12% off a 1.8K ish price which will be =
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6922,$ 1200.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6922,Of cse
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6922,", if u add up to 2K config, with 25% off still exceeding 1.5K, u will get an xbox u can still sell off also."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6922,"anyway, end up"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6922,"i just ask the CSO nicely can give me 25% code or not,  they ask me if i am a frontline worker, which i am, and they give me a 25% code anyway."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6923,Provided can sell xbox for 300 la
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6923,If ps4 no doubt.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6976,any release date for the t14/t14s series and their supposed prices?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6976,might hold off getting the t495 for the latest.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6991,"I have never owned one, but I was familiar with it as I have sold their laptops before."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6991,I really liked them.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6991,"That was slightly more than 10 years ago, where X61 was the latest and it was still under IBM."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6991,Back then it was crazy expensive
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6991,and I told myself when I grow up
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6991,", i would like to own 1 for myself."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6991,At that point no need for me to buy it as I was hardcore gamer heavily into custom desktops and custom gaming desktops was cheaper for value and bang for buck spent.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6991,"Fast forward to today, currently working, no longer into PC gaming."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6991,Life responsibilities dictates that I play with excel spreadsheets instead of virtual swords and shield.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6991,"So here am I, buying a laptop and fulfilling what I want to do 10 years ago."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6991,TL;DR - personal preference for thinkpad series.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,6994,although i pretty much prefer the keyboards on thinkpads on X220 and before.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7041,"In the end, I decide to save by getting a cheaper one with better 2 years warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7042,if you think the 1660ti is worth the $400 upgrade from 1650 then just go for it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7042,everyone have their own budget

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7044,Lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7045,1650 to 2060 $450 is a good deal.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7045,"For Legion, 1650 to Ti is actually $60+ for the ones who used Shopback18 + cashback"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7046,That's true
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7046,Usually is green blue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7046,Any icon yellow colour?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7046,The big question is
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7046,"""is AMD able to tie down their partners to offer AMD gaming laptops with better specs and material?"""
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7046,Right now...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7046,Intel is still dominating premium and luxury laptops
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7046,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7047,"if they can stuff in the 2060..
for under 2k... looks like solid buy"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7048,The $450 likely include other spec upgrade if not Lenovo is overcharging.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7048,Asus g14 can go from 1650 to 1660 for only 100usd bump and that include extra ram too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7048,Even 1660 to 2060 only additional 100usd bump and with better cpu/storage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7049,$150 different between 1660ti and 2060 for Legion 5 Intel model.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7055,then onsite upgrade from 1Y Depot/cci means what?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7056,This is just the worst case scenario.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7056,Normally delivery in 2 weeks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7056,Approximately end june or early july from 14 June
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7057,Please remember to purchase the $36 onsite 2 year warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7057,Better to be safe than sorry
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7058,It's normal Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7058,They need to improve their delivery timing significantly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7059,"1Y deport mean you need to bring the laptop to service centre when spoilt, and go again to collect it after repair."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7059,The warranty is 1 year.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7059,"After the $30+ upgrade, lenovo will send engineer  down to to your home for repair on next working day after you report issue, and warranty is 2 years."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7069,errr.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7069,how to check if got xbox even though laptop above 1.5k?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7070,Must try.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7070,Most customer will try to email them to get their order prioritised .. and that will push your delivery date backwards if you didnt request..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7070,as such this will turn out yours Order become less prioritised while those that Did emailed Got their order prioritised.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7071,Thanks bro for the advice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7071,"I dropped an email too, asking them to expedite as I need it for school."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7074,say you bought during the XBOX giveaway promotion period and your laptop cost more than 1.5k
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7075,"It's moronic that they don't tell buyers whether they can have the xbox, and no transparency."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7076,Where you guys bought from?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7076,Can share link?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7077,from the way they issue the discount code you can tell their culture
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7078,We bought the laptop online via Lenovo website during Lenovo + Shopback sale on last weekend.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7079,Oh there was a promotion last week?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7079,So now no more shopback voucher already?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7080,The keyboard has numpad inside
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7080,so its
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7080,abit squeezed for someone who hasnt used such a layout before.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7090,Have your check your system resources and find out whether your CPU is continuously running at high capacity?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7090,It might due to lots of services or application running on backend.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7090,"Either disable them, or backup data and follow by reformat reinstall Windows might solve it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7091,last week was the best.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7126,worth?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7126,casual gaming and mostly use for school/office work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7127,How much will that be in total ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7128,Not at all.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7128,Should even consider other laptops for that work flow.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7128,1650 is neither here nor there gpu.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7128,Those buying legion 5 now is due to the cpu needs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7129,No.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7129,U need two nvme ssd to gwt 80wh battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7130,Honestly 1650 and 1650ti is just a 5% fps difference.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7130,Are you willing to pay for it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7130,Channel the fund to boost ram or ssd seems like a good value.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7130,Or even upgrade to ryzen 7
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7131,Next 144hz on 1650 1080p?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7134,School and office work dies not matter whether it's a 60Hz or 144Hz screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7134,"You can also add a bit more, get a gaming monitor on top of the $180."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7135,30%?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7135,"Must be old benchmark,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7135,newer 1650 now comes with gddr6 so smaller gap between both models
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7136,"I see, then it must be 10% or less only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7137,Serious gamers would look away from legion 5 15 AMD

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7142,Is it possible because I was on wireless thats why 4K video on YouTube seemed choppy?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7143,GTX1650 to Ti version assuming both GDDR6
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7143,..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7143,actual FPS gain is 5-15% only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7143,"The more intensive the game GPU wise, the lesser the gains."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7143,"Cost diff is around SGD $60-70, in Legion 5 context, after applying discount code."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7148,Is there still the requirement of spending above or equal 1.5k dollars after discount is applied on the lenovo laptop in order to get the xbox one s?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7149,"From the website I saw, the Xbox is only applicable to the first 50 people who purchased above $1500 legion laptop in a single receipt."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7149,Did anybody see this too?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7165,Amd 4000 is giving intel a big challenge
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7166,"I heard that for ryzen, if it's 8gb ram, only about 4gb is usable because the rest is reserved ram."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7166,Like that still better than intel if im not using it for gaming?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7167,The new Ryzen 4800h hp omen 15 seems good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7168,This is what AMD has been doing for the past 2 years
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7169,This only happens if you use the integrated gpu that comes with the intel/amd cpu because igpu don't have virtual memory aka vram
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7169,Igpu will treat the system memory aka your physical ram as its virtual memory
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7170,Always go for 16gb of ram in 2020.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7170,Unless you doing basic work then 8gb
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7171,I feel that A lot of premium laptops and more premium parts are still intel.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7304,"With a maximum white level of 343 cd/m2 and a black level of 0.309 cd/m2, the display used by Legion 5 offers an excellent contrast, over 1000:1."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7304,"Color reproduction and uniformity are also stellar, with the average Delta E deviation having a value of only 0.79."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7304,"Gamers and professionals alike can use this display, for both purposes."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7305,"In terms of battery life, Lenovo Legion 5 15ARH05 has good performance, providing over 9 hours of work, 4 hours of intensive work or 3 hours of gaming away from the socket."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7305,"It is not an ultra-portable and we cannot expect the same numbers, but overall you can work for a quite a while away from the power outlet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7306,"the cooling system used by Lenovo is a bit quieter, with the meter recording 41.3 dB, compared to the 44.5 dB reached by the Asus model, so this difference could easily be turned in Lenovos favor with a more aggresive fan profile."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7306,"However, it is possible that this is only a characteristic of the sample we used for testing, and retail versions actually do have a more aggressive fan profile."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7307,U going for gaming H/HS or U processor ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7308,Mine still at Shanghai

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7349,any idea how much to top up?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7350,No details atm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7351,"My guess, from 1650, top up to 1660ti will need $250, top up to 2060 will be $400."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7352,choose

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7357,"Frankly speaking, if top up 1650 to 2060 need $400."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7357,I might as well get 1650 and spend additional to buy Sony PS5 right.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7358,Bro is it exactly this product or which one?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7358,i see so many option but no legion 5
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7359,but ps5 this year i am guessing it will cost 1000 sgd
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7359,if spend 1k to buy a game console.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7359,i rather build a ryzen desktop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7360,Dell G5 15 SE 2020 performance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7360,"Stacked within the belly of the Dell G5 15 SE, is an AMD Ryzen R7 4800H processor with 16GB of RAM, which easily tore through 40 Google Chrome tabs and five 1080p YouTube videos while Assassin’s Creed Odyssey ran in the background."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7360,"On the Geekbench 4.3 overall performance test, the Dell G5 15 SE nailed 29,253, which soared over the 21,322 mainstream gaming laptop average."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7360,"It crushed the Intel Core i7-9750H in the Omen 15 19,956 and Legion Y545 23,868, but the Ryzen 9 4900HS in the Zephyrus G14 30,181 killed the G5 15."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7360,"The Dell G5 15 SE transcoded a 4K video to 1080p in 6 minutes and 43 seconds on our HandBrake benchmark, sailing past the category average 10:35."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7360,"It not only surpassed the Omen 15 12:34 and Legion Y545 8:51, but also topped the Zephyrus G14 6:59."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7360,"Dell’s 512GB SSD copied 4.97GB of data in 12.4 seconds, translating to 410 megabytes per second, which is just under the 467-MBps mainstream gaming laptop average."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7360,"The Legion Y545’s 128GB SSD hit a slow 189 MBps, whereas the 512GB SSD in the Omen 15 and the 1TB SSD in Zephyrus G14 nailed 728 MBps and 1,131 MBps, respectively."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7360,Dell G5 15 SE 2020 battery life
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7360,The Dell G5 15 SE has some of the longest battery life we’ve seen in a gaming laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7360,"Surprise, surprise, it’s all thanks to AMD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7360,"After it continuously surfed the web over Wi-Fi at 150 nits of brightness, the G5 15's battery lasted 7 hours and 14 minutes, which crushed the 4:50 mainstream gaming laptop average."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7360,"The Omen 15 3:05 and Legion Y545 3:38 were basically dead on arrival, while the only competitor left standing was the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 11:32, which can also thank AMD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7361,yeah
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7361,nothing special but
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7361,some models of the x360 come with realtek wifi5.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7361,Deal-breaker
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7361,if the sg version comes with wifi5
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7362,firstly you need a router with wifi 6 ax capabilities.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7362,then you need to have a good fibre speed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7362,if cannot fulfill both condition then quite pointless
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7362,wifi
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7362,5 ac will suffice
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7363,choose 2020款拯救者R7000】银粒子抗菌键盘膜 if u want with silver particles anti bacterial.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7363,in china our model is called r7000
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7364,edit: found a few other seller of this product...5 dollar for the high end one before shipping....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7364,after shipping alone its 10 dollar same as ezbuy unless u consolidate with other items
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7365,"T ohbiang leh.....
not lifestyle"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7366,Nice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7366,thank you captain
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7367,can teach me if should go 6c or 8c.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7367,Also 8 and 16T too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7367,Is core or thread significant?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7368,What app do you use to test this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7369,Those bench mark are not by me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7369,From professional  reviewers
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7370,Threads are very important as core.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7370,Depends on your use case
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7371,"The cost difference is not a lot, but you will feel the performance difference when you need that extra bit of processing power."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7371,Get 8C 16T 4800H for future proof.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7372,"Those of yall who ordered legion 5 last week, is the current eta earlier than the 8 weeks as stated when ordered?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7373,I have gigabit fibre with AX88U.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7373,Plus laptop will use for 3 to 5 years...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7373,Might as well get the latest now if possible.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7374,Under 2 weeks delivery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7374,Unless no stock for parts

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7375,Nice asus router btw
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7376,If your budget allows...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7376,"Go for ryzen 7 or ryzen 9 like 4800U, 4800H, 4900H, 4900HS"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7376,The difference in performance is huge between ryzen 5 & 7
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7376,"Furthermore, the upgrade cost between ryzen 5 & 7 is like $100."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7376,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7377,cores perform better than threads tho..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7377,8/8 performs better than 4/8
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7378,I dont sit in Starbucks even before CB
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7378,so looks is the least of my concern
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7379,For me i do not need 8c16t computing power.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7379,I rather spend the $100 on ssd or ram.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7379,But i must say the pricing is very tempting.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7379,I shall not chase technology blindly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7379,I shall spend within my limits
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7380,For me..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7380,i max out cpu ram
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7380,Probably should be able to serve me well for 5 years
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7380,I chose 256gb SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7380,cuz I don't download much content...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7380,Nowadays almost everything is streamed
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7380,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7381,"I order on 14 June, expected to deliver to me in 6 July."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7381,Have emailed CS 2 times but no reply.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7381,Sad!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7382,"Depends on your usage, nobody knows it better than you."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7382,"Personally, my work requirement is more core more thread more RAM more SSD"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7382,the better
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7383,i think i should buy 1 more ax router
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7383,lol...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7383,i got 2gb internet but only using 1gb
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7384,leaving shanghai now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7384,should be in korea tomorrow morning
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7385,I think I need either 8/8-47U or 8/16-48U.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7385,Not sure how the threads works...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7385,core means more ppl working on it la
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7386,For laptop just get a higher end processor and ram since cannot upgrade easily..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7387,You serious boh or just trolling?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7387,"If you need an analogy using people, each core is like a worker but the worker can be dumb one, only know how to do one thing at a time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7387,Some workers smarter can use both hands and do two things at the same time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7387,The first one is no thread enabled while the second worker is thread enabled and ideally can do twice as much work as the first type of worker.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7387,"However, some type of work may require two hands in the first place so both types of worker end up no difference for this type of work."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7387,So ideally 4C/8T can appear like a 8C/8T CPU
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7387,"but for some types of work load, the 8C/8T can be much faster."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7388,Ryzen 7 4800H is definitely a good upgrade from Ryzen 5 in terms of performance if you are in for gaming or video editing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7389,gaming
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7389,i dont think so.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7389,4 core is sufficient for now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7389,unless future game dev increase the core count.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7389,but with lousy 1650 will become the bottleneck in future.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7389,video edit definitely improve the rendering time with respect to core count
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7390,long story short.. just hoot the bugger  4800u ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7391,"I personally think that those who buy Legion 5 without upgrading to Ryzen 7 4800H is wasted, this processor can last us for many years as it is so advance and powerful."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7391,Getting a good processor laptop is importance if you plan to use it for a long time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7391,"My 10 years old first generation i7 Lenovo ideapad Y550P laptop is unable to play any AAA games now, but it still work wonder after upgrade to 8GB Ram and SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7391,"I can run Zoom, multiple Chrome and office, play some light games on the same time and it boot up within 5 seconds."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7392,wa your laptop lasted 10years
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7393,"Yes, I purposely spend more to get i7 so that it can last."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7393,"Interesting, those who want to see my 10 years old i7 laptop can refer to this review."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7394,anyone got good lobang for nice laptop bag for legion 5?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7395,"Hi,for the ups delivery is it possible to choose timing to deliver"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7396,I select the same parts as you but the still after the code is still 1.7k...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7397,"Did you select the backpack, mouse and headset?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7397,Sometimes they will auto select for you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7397,Remove alry will hit ~$1.5k
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7398,"Remove mouse, headset and backpack."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7398,Keep the 2 years warranty.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7400,Ya.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7400,Still can meet schedule of delivering by tomorrow 9PM?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7401,Shenzhen is normally the last stop before Singapore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7401,See whether can depart korea today
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7402,How do you know is 9pm?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7403,But timing not sure is which timezone.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7403,so 12hrs different
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7404,wow!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7404,travel to kimchi land
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7404,"anyway, as long as its on its way can liao."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7404,It took around 3 weeks for my Lenovo Chromebook to arrive from US to Singapore even though it was on Amazon Prime
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7405,Either Wednesday or Thursday.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7406,Confirm Wednesday and don't be surprise they deliver at 850pm...

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7409,but I saw that they have shipped out on 20th June.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7409,Expected delivery date is 26 June
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7410,Bro your warranty is 1 year carry in ah?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7410,not 2 years onsite?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7411,Mine same as yours.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7411,I wonder why need to go korea first.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7411,Korea got 2nd wave of covid now sia
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7412,Just email cso tell them you want to buy 2 year warranty
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7413,Shipping company operate in such a way that they need a consolidation hub.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7413,They dont work like on demand where they send from the shipper to the addressee direct.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7413,They need volume to ship.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7413,Cant be 1 parcel from china straight to singapore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7413,So they all go through a consolidation hub.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7413,Where all the rest of the world items come in to consolidation hub and redistribute to the destination of country.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7413,So they will consolidate all the shipment that is going to singapore then load up and leave.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7413,"If they cant get volume, they will then send in to another consolidation hub."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7413,Thats why you see some of your shipment from china go korea then back to china.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7413,Which means that in korea they dont have enough load to load up the plane to travel back to sg.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7413,They will not ship a half or 3/4 empty plane.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7465,Msg them
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7465,and they say not happy go find lazada.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7465,Ask lazada then they claimed that cannot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7465,They refuse to honour.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7465,"Few weeks back, my friend wanted the model you posted."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7465,In shopee mentioned that buy this during flash deal and get delivered next day.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7465,So she ordered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7465,And the next day they say cannot commit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7465,Cannot commit nvm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7465,Still say no stocks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7465,No stocks then still flash deal.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7465,Furthermore ask her to take intel 8th gen laptop of a lower value and throw in free microsoft office.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7465,Not happy complain to shopee ask for refund.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7465,The attitude really bad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7466,That's like Jovie Chew's way of doing business.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7466,"Thank you for the information, will take note of this shop."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7485,So many Legion owners here..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7485,welcome to the club
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7486,Its possible given the chassis size.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7486,It is a 17 inch.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7486,"definitely not very portable, more desktop replacement"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7487,17 inch 3kg laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7488,yea probably close to that
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7489,Typical sim lim scum laptop seller.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7489,Migrated over after the death of Newstead.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7490,wow.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7490,enjoy
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7491,The packaging which went across many places in Asia before it reaches my hands.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7491,Very thick sponge to protect the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7491,"I think they were trying to *elevate"" the laptop when you lift up the top and bottom of the sponge"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7491,In the box
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7491,The shimmer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7491,I have to say that Legion 5 is probably the most low profile gaming laptop in the market right now

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7496,What are their specifications?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7496,Super value buy at 2 for less than $2k
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7497,I think mostly whom bought a Lenovo laptop in this group is buy direct ba.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7497,Very difficult to give the local retail business.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7497,Retail business really need to buck up a lot in terms of customer service and aftersale service.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7497,"If both of this cannot be met, and if e retail can do returns and ok aftersales support."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7497,I feel that buyers are better off buying at e retail instead.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7498,bypass resellers better
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7499,Nice
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7500,Lets share specifications.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7501,hope to join u all again during the next big sale!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7502,I am loving the Legion 5 keyboard.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7502,Its like a cross between Thinkpad and Ideapad
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7502,"Though it takes a little bit getting used to the ""Backspace"" key and the ""NUMLOCK"" key being placed next to each other"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7503,ya its really like a thinkpad x gaming build.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7503,with the matte black look

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7506,I also received the laptop at around 4pm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7506,But now still at work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7506,Need to install amd chipset driver and use Ryzen balance plan like their desktop version?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7507,Is it auto update?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7508,"From my own experience, it's Not auto update."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7508,"For AMD, I go to AMD driver website and let it auto detect"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7508,"For Nvidia, I created a new nvidia account"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7510,But luckily I don't play AAA games.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7511,"unless retailers can match or even beat the discounts given by lenovo, else i think it is very difficult"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7512,Bro.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7512,Which credit card got 5% cash back?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7520,So you clone the SSD???
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7520,Can give a guide?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7520,I also thinking to do something similar
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7520,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7521,samsung pm981 quite fast.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7521,those with 2 nvme
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7521,i wonder if speed is slower
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7522,wont clone.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7522,always get blue screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7522,fresh install better after driver backup
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7523,those with 4800H can you benchmark the cpu?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7523,if you get 19k means the 6 core is 16% slower
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7524,Can the usb c port be used to charge the legion 5?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7525,I'm curious how do you get 240fps from a 60hz panel?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7526,I don't think so.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7526,It's not able to power up the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7526,Connect to a USB c monitor is ok

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7528,"Anyway, I don't experience 240fps throughout.."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7529,dont bother clone your nvme ssd to sata
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7529,"2.5"" ssd."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7529,stock samsung nvme is much faster.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7529,unless you plan to buy a new Samsung 970 PRO NVMe M.2 Ssd
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7529,then cloning is worth it
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7530,sadly no cannot charge.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7530,usbc only for displayport
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7531,dont forget to debloat windows 10
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7532,Those with the smaller battery can consider limiting cpu max to 30% in power options and max graphics power savings when in battery mode.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7532,Your battery life will double to 7h as cpu limits itself to 1.38Ghz instead of running 3GHz all the time
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7532,performance at 1.38GHz is about a ryzen 2500u
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7533,can share how to limit cpu
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7534,Received mine today.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7534,Ran Cinebench R20.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7534,For reference my 2015 Razer Blade 4720HQ gets around 1200pts.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7534,"This beast got 4400-4500pts on performance mode with no dips on multiple runs plus it is quieterlower pitch fan noise than my Razer Blade, peak temp 92c on the CPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7534,Will be using it mostly for photo/video editing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7534,Love the keyboard and build quality especially for the price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7534,But i might be tempted if they release a 2060 version since Premiere Pro just got updated and supports NVENC exports.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7534,I also like the Lenovo Vantage application for the battery conservation mode
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7534,", i usually leave the laptop plugged in and conservation mode doesn't fully charge the battery to reduce battery degradation."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7535,Base on what I read from Ultrabook review website...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7535,"Legion 5 is able to go up to RTX 2060,  up to 64GB ram 2 x 32gb and paired with 144hz screen"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7537,This is so true.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7538,this the s540 13are?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7539,Not bad for 15w cpu perform better than 45w 4600H
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7540,Of course it is.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7541,advanced power option
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7542,How do you wish to limit the cpu?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7542,Turn off boosting?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7543,"Luck of draw,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7543,The one i've gotten came with the Samsung PM981a and the best 2.5K QHD panel out of the 4 currently used by lenovo for this model.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7544,switchable graphics
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7544,>
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7544,if force power savings when on battery
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7544,The laptop uses amd apu instead of nvidia.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7544,uses 18w when gaming and fan doesn't blow hot air
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7545,I play the same game.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7545,The 4800H and
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7545,GTX1650
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7545,Ti gives me constant 60 FPS
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7545,I limit it on 1080P
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7545,but in wvw or world boss events it drops to 30-45..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7545,which is still darn good for an unoptimised game.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7545,My desktop i5-6500 and GTX1070 gives 20-25 FPS in same scenario..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7545,but its running 1440P ultra widescreen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7546,How did you buy this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7547,If you all using Lenovo Vantage software.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7547,I believe you all can control performance or windows power profile.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7547,If you really want a very cool cpu under gaming load.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7547,Best is to disable boost mode.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7547,This will run 4800H at 2.9Ghz on all cores during gaming.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7547,It will be negligible performance impact on games.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7553,300nits?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7553,so what is total landing price inclusive gst ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7553,I think it's like around $1100 ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7553,cheap compared to Legion 5?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7554,should be QHD 2.5K panel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7555,I used a china card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7555,When i was making payment i saw that they accepted international payment though i did not try a non-china card before
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7556,Not sure what you mean by suitable CC.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7556,Bought using mastercard.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7556,There is no need for 3rd party forwarder when buying from official flagship stores on platforms for example JD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7556,They will ship direct to your designated address.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7558,ma  use battery  ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7559,You are welcomed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7559,The battery should last more than 8 hours on balanced power profile.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7559,Official reviews put the numbers closer to 11 hours.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7559,GAN PD chargers are 1/2 the size and weight of the included power adapter which serves as excellent alternative for frequent travellers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7559,Do not think it is advisable to bring personal notebooks for work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7559,This notebook is also suitable for females as it weighs only 1.26kg and only the size of an A4 paper.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7560,will this model brought into singapore?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7561,Wow I see.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7561,I guess it only applies to certain items.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7561,I tried to buy the UX425 from JD but it wouldn't let me checkout to Singapore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7561,"When I put a China forwarding address, it would only let me link to a Chinese bank account on payment."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7562,bro gian already ah?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7563,Do you mind to PM the URL?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7563,Thanks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7564,"Holy sheet, like that no point buying laptop from Singapore sia."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7564,So much cheaper even with GST.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7564,Do note the two Type C on the S540/Xiaoxin are Gen 1 only
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7565,"If purchase from JD, means no warranty?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7566,Yeah I guess need to ship back to China yourself.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7566,That is the only risk ba.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7566,Cos you may end up with dead pixels all those if you are unlucky
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7567,Eventually it will come.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7567,"But looking at the price of a particular local reseller listing a lower tier model,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7567,I'm pretty sure this notebook will not come cheap when it start selling in SG.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7567,These are the prices in CN.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7567,"Currently there is a shortage, may be due to insufficient components such as the NVME SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7567,The SG version should comes with 1TB NVME SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7567,NOTE:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7567,This notebook can only be equipped with single sided NVME SSD if you intend to swap out or upgrade.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7568,very good price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7568,got international warranty?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7569,The USB C ports seems to be able to support 4K 60Hz output according to this review
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7570,Ship back to China for warranty if you bought it elsewhere.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7571,Yup DP thru type C should be able to support 4k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7571,"Question is whether it's displayport 1.4, which can then support up to 3x 4k 60hz over one cable"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7572,Deleted.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7572,Post in wrong forum
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7573,you can always buy from the usa and ship back sg
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7574,"Do not buy the wrong one, JD will auto revert to a item base on availability and Geo-location."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7574,"in this case, your link is correct, this is the lenovo official flagship store, but the notebook is out of stock, the selection automatically refer to last year's model."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7575,so actually is it only speed difference since it has PD charging and display?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7576,Maybe should take a look at how much JD is selling for this model and why now many people are avoiding this variant.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7577,"Haha, JD is selling how much for the same specifications?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7578,KYM
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7578,Rumour:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7578,"Tiagong, A particular A coy made a complain to another"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7578,A coy saying another coy not playing fair by secretly increasing their line of 4800H TDP beyond 54watt.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7578,In the end their own line of products came under scrutiny for bad design with overheating problems.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7578,tiagong only....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7579,Interesting story.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7579,Any link to read?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7579,There are only 2 Axxx company.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7579,Easily guess.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7580,Apple and Aftershock?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7580,Hahaha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7581,"Yup, there are actually 4 different panel vendors for this notebook as well as 2 Nvme SSD vendors, SamsungPM981a and WD black SN730."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7581,it is full metal case finish.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7581,Back lacks HDMI output.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7581,"For people who want to make comparison for the different models, can refer to the below: only in Mandarin"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7582,Acer could be offended by my statement:

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7582,AMD could be offended by my statement?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7582,Asrock could be offended by my statement?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7583,You forget to add Aftershock.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7584,Nice that is quite fast.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7584,Was it easy to change from Chinese OS to English OS?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7585,Only Tier manufacturers could afford to make the complain.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7585,They have all the leverages.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7585,Resellers have better know their place less making a whimper might not even have the stocks allocated for them to make any sales.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7586,Format and reinstall.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7586,20mins affair.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7586,I have to forgo the included authentic MS office.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7586,99.9% of notebooks sold in CN have a variant of Windows 10 chinese version meant only for their market.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7586,There is a slight difference from the windows 10 used by the rest of the world.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7586,One does not simply change the language from chinese to EN.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7587,Can reuse the same licence?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7587,Heard need to have own code
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7588,"Vid of someone using a PD charger while playing game ""simple games""."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7588,note the glossy screen
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7589,"Very nice, still can play GTA somemore."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7589,Do you guys know any other brand name laptops that can ship from JD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7589,seems like latest envy
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7589,x360 and Asus restricted from shipping to sg
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7590,Yes there are times where by the flagship stores themselves do not want to entertain overseas purchases for certain batches of goods.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7590,"same when as you go into newegg US or amazon US when the item added in the cart ""disappear"" after changing location to SG."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7590,the same thing happens for this first batch of S540-13ARE when it was initially launched.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7590,"The JD website will show ""this item is not supported for sale in your region"""
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7590,I was lucky to camp the site when the 3rd batch release to able to select SG as my shipping destination.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7590,Now the price of this notebook has increased and worse...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7590,no more stocks after reviews came out.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7593,p/s you download windows to thumbdrive?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7594,No.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7594,This is not provided.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7594,it is to illustrate that the notebook supports compatible PD chargers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7595,There is something like a key or certificate in the BIOS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7595,I believe a fellow forumer posted a rough guide on how to reinstall windows.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7596,what's the diff btw the one at JD and

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7600,"Overall, really satisfied with the build quality and performance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7600,Touchpen accuracy is fantastic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7600,Hinges are solid during tablet and tent mode.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7600,"The screen however, is pretty lacking"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7600,"did my research prior so within expectations Can't really discern red and orange, so for those doing video editing do look elsewhere"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7600,"Excellent product for me, price point wise!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7601,I don't think this model or it's variants are available for sale in CN
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7602,That was a pretty good deal you've gotten.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7603,"So difference is slim bigger battery, FHD screen but 14"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7604,Deal
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7604,wasnt as great
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7604,but they did gave another 5% discount due to delay shipment from 2 weeks to roughly 6 weeks
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7604,Probably my initial discount code at 12% wasnt that high to begin with.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7605,The first ThinkPad with Ryzen 4000 has arrived: AMD much faster than Intel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7606,Wah total 17%

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7647,They first asked whether there's any modifications etc.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7658,highlight or whatsoveer?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7658,Also do you still use A4 lecture pad?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7659,"unfortunately we only got estimates..
june supposedly, but june has come and almost ending."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7659,So me guess is july/august pending any further delays
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7659,AMD versions has arrived for reviews..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7659,so i suppose its not far.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7660,Recommended by Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7660,Goto Vantage set the battery to conservative mode.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7660,It wont charge battery over 60 % to prolong the battery life.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7661,Anyone got reviews on the older Amd?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7661,A10 9700b series is listed as quad core but unsure of how it will stand compared to stuff like i5 8250
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7662,HP one look not bad
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7662,got

especially now that new apu are already in the market."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7664,so I can review my lectures on the go
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7665,The A series architecturally speaking is much much weaker than the Ryzen series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7665,Infact Ryzen is the successor to it
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7665,but it is still in produced for lower end models
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7666,"Why not flat when closed mode, got flex one."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7668,Optimizing for lifespan years
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7668,"Battery longevity is affected by age, the number of charge cycles, amount of time at full charge, and high temperature."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7668,"For maximum lifespan when rarely using the battery, set Custom charge thresholds to start charging at 40% capacity and stop at 50%, and keep the ThinkPad cool."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7668,The thresholds can be adjusted in the Battery Maintenance settings of Lenovo Power Manager.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7668,"If the battery is used somewhat frequently, set the start threshold at around 85% and stop at 90%."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7668,This will still give a good lifespan benefit over keeping the battery charged to 100%.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7668,"The simplest way to optimize battery lifespan is to select Automatic in the Power Manager Battery Maintenance settings, and let the power manager manage the battery charge thresholds."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7669,HP can give heavy discount like lenovo?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7670,Hp normally give discount on shopee

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7675,"I think with Lenovo E series prices so affordable, really can consider a Ryzen 5 minimally"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7676,Perhaps last reply.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7676,We can discuss about this on another thread - to prevent this topic from going off topic.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7676,Text book is different though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7676,"If it's university level, it's few hundred to thousand over pages."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7676,I never tried that before on One note.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7676,It typically take sometime to load PDFs in.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7676,"So with so many pages, theoretically possible, but not too sure on performance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7676,"For those, I use either Microsoft Edge to read and highlight"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7676,must remember to save the PDF.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7676,If written eqn etc.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7676,iPad with apple pencil.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7676,"If type equations, I do it on overleaf or Latex on desktop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7676,Also on A4 paper
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7677,You can look at cpumark to guage how fast it is.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7677,anything above 2500 points is usable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7677,it is 30% the speed of 8250.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7677,still decent for web browsing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7678,dunno also.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7678,maybe is that unit problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7679,never see before...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7679,if can give discount like lenovo will be quite worth it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7680,Btw how will chiu know when Lenovo will deliver the Xbox one gift?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7681,guess we have to see the 2060 version
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7682,it is about the price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7682,"Now with highest spec, we can get about 1400-1500 after disc & cashback but not included xbox sale."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7682,"With 2060 will be near to $1,800-2,000."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7683,yea likely
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7684,Before or after discount?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7684,If after discount still seem ex though
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7685,Bought a laptop from lenovo online ytd under the fast delivery ship out within 2 business days.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7685,"Though its not a Thinkpad, anyone knows if it will actually ship out within 2 business days given the many delays that many people reported"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7685,"Oh and I used both LENOVO18 and the shopback cashback, no problems with the cashback right?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7685,"Not sure if there are any changes but when I buy last year with agent promo code + shopback, all is good.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7686,after discount
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7687,They will ship within 2 business days.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7687,So you'll gonna receive it after 4 business days from the date you ordered.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7691,Anyone knows where to buy original Lenovo LCD panel for T495s?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7691,I bought one online via ebay
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7691,but it is not original even though it comes with Lenovo sticker with the model number and part number
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7691,but it is not not same after installation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7691,Windows also fails to detect it as a Lenovo panel but recognise it only a generic PnP monitor and even AMD Radeon FreeSync is disabled as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7691,HWInfo only captured the OEM panel manufacturer such as ChiMei but the actual OEM part number is not the same as the sticker as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7691,So most likely it is an OEM panel with fake Lenovo sticker.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7691,I did ask Lenovo for the panel
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7691,but it costs almost $400 and still charged me $150 on top to install.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7692,drop me a PM
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7693,Bro your PM is full.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7698,Yes by default it is enabled using AMD drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7699,"I see, I did not even noticed it after using T495 for coming to a year."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7700,Awesome!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7700,THANKS!!!!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7700,"yes... for T495s thinkpad users, if your monitor comes with AMD freesync, you can update to AMD Radeon software"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7702,"For those with legion 5, may i know do u all have issue with turning on the keyboard backlit?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7702,I'm not able to turn it on with FN+spacebar most of the time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7702,But no issue turning it on with lenovo vantage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7702,"After turning on with vantage, i can toggle it off using FN+spacebar but will not be able to turn it back on unless i use vantage to toggle."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7702,Summary:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7702,Use FN+spcaebar not able to on backlit
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7703,try to do a clean uninstall of Lenovo Vantage and re-install again
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7703,"if that fails, then try to download Lenovo Utility App"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7703,When I first boot up my Legion 5...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7703,I spent the whole afternoon updating the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7703,Make sure the Windows 10 Home has all the latest patches
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7703,Make sure Lenovo Vantage update
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7703,all the Lenovo software and programs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7703,Make sure AMD is updated
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7703,Make sure Nvidia is updated
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7703,Update Microsoft Edge to the latest edition
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7703,Remove all bloatware thanks for sharing the program to remove the bloatware.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7703,once all these is done.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7703,"I will run all the update checks one more time, just to make sure that everything is updated."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7703,Then I proceed to install my games
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7704,Backlit no issue
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7705,Same.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7705,"I realized once Lenovo Vantage starts up and takes over control, you can only control through the app."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7705,"Else, just restart and don't start-up Vantage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7705,It will work normally with FN + Spacebar
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7706,I would like to know too.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7706,"Suay, used chrome plugin but my shopback cashback was rejected."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7706,Checked with sgcs@lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7706,Reply:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7706,We will send out 50 Xbox to the 1st 50 customers who buy this item at over 1500 SGD price after 7% GST.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7706,Our marketing team will reach you if you are one of the lucky first 50 customers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7706,Qsn: Asked if I was one of the 50 :
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7706,Reply :
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7706,"Sorry, we have no access to find this out, our marketing team will reach out to the qualified customers  after the order is delivered successfully."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7707,Whoa they chut so many pattern one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7707,"Luckily i saved the chat log of the customer service staff that mentioned I am entitled to the xbox one straightaway without the ""one of the lucky first 50 customers. """
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7708,May I know how do you remove the bloatware?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7709,Was your shopback cashback tracked after you made your payment?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7709,How long was it before you are notified of the rejection?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7709,Got use any promo codes when checking out at lenovo online?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7709,"Asking cos my cashback is shown as tracked currently, with no futher updates.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7710,Looks promising...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7710,The version coming to Singapore should have similar specs
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7711,Mine only Click activity clicked.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7711,My transaction was not recorded
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7711,so I reported missing cashback.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7711,I received my order and report missing cashback with updated info.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7711,Shopback stated that - Lenovo 'deemed my order did not arise from Shopback'.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7711,CSO helped me quote order using SHOPBACK20 after it expired.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7711,Maybe because the T&C ' Use only promo codes featured on ShopBack'.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7712,Lucky you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7712,Sibei sian.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7712,"Pattern more than badminton,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7712,no transparency with the promotion.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7712,"I checked another CSO after my order, say Promotion still on-going after I made my order."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7712,"Sadly, forget to SS."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7712,Now need to play waiting game.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7712,Don't know how to contact the marketing department.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7712,Please update here if you received an email from their 'Marketing Department'.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7712,Fell prey to their promotional deal.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7712,I push to 1.5k really shoot myself in the foot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7713,That sucks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7713,Lenovo products are good but their customer service and their promotions always have a lot of hidden T&Cs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7713,Much more than other companies.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7713,"For their live chat, I think its heng suay.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7713,it depends on who you are talking to.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7713,Some are very stingy and make their replies very ambiguous.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7714,Hope his saved chat will work in the event they say he is not in the first 50.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7714,Later they say their decision is final and there is no way to change it even though their CSO says otherwise
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7714,lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7715,"Hais, do whatever they can to hit sales target"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7715,"bah

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7715,Too bad I on the receiving end
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7716,"Yeah....after you make order, talk to CSO"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7716,"no use already, they won the battle and convinced you to buy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7716,"Please proceed to contact sgcs@lenovo, the backend team for any enquiries on your existing orders."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7716,Next round of badminton
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7717,Most likely they will choose either.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7724,"It's normal, ultrabooks are meant to be thin"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7724,but with that comes limited cooling capabilities.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7724,For Renoir it depends on the implementation of the cooling system.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7724,Like for eg.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7724,see the complaints on the net about the Asus TUF.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7725,No.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7725,I was referring to the HP Envy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7725,The uh-x is overpriced imo for its specs...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7725,Comet lake and no thunderbolt 3...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7726,That's the only issue with AMD
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7726,No TB3
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7726,this is kinda exclusive only to Intel.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7739,Can manually delete just Google it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7740,My new Legion 5 has only 1 set of 512mb m.2 disk.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7740,"If I add ssd to the empty second disk slot, will it void the warranty?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7741,"SSD, HDD and RAM are supposed to be user replaceable parts."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7741,So warranty should not be voided
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7742,No.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7742,They just wont warranty the parts
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7742,u change.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7742,So say you put in ssd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7742,They just dont warranty that ssd loh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7742,The rest will still be intact.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7743,So should I get the Aftershock Apex 15R Lite or wait for Legion 5 to come out with a 2060 option?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7743,I need the 2060 graphics.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7743,Am not sure whether Lenovo will issue a 2060 Legion 5 model in SG.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7743,Then again also concerned about the small 47W battery in the Apex - surely the batt will die very quickly even when not gaming?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7818,ya!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7818,maybe wrong pricing??
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7819,"E14 already 1 soldered 1 sodimm, so mostlikely t14 all soldered."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7819,In my opinion no point buying t14 anymore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7820,according to psref..still have one socket
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7821,16gb enough for me...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7821,I just want 2x usb-c ports for dual displayport output
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7822,cross fingers

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7827,One free slot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7827,16 GB for sure can.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7829,I heard the deep learning needs gpu power
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7829,Ryzen 7 4700u up to task?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7830,The vega 7 intergrated graphic can make it or not?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7831,dunno haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7832,Bought one from jd.com and their declared value for the laptop was about $50 higher using the current fx rate when they convert to sgd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7832,Did you encounter the same thing?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7833,"I think for customoversea shipping declaration, JD will use the official list price of the item value."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7833,"meaning the declared price will not include: when the item is under promotions, flash deals, pre launch sale, rebates etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7833,"Example, I bought a notebook listed as 4999 rmb flash deal, the official list price of the item is 5299 rmb, JD will declare item value as 5299 rmb conversion to destination currency when shipping."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7834,spec says up to 32GB so should be OK.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7834,The 32GB is what I am looking forward to.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7834,"That said, I've tested 32GB DIMM + 8GB soldered on my current T470"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7834,and it worked too despite not in the original spec.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7835,will it include GST when we buy from overseas?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7836,Goods exceeding SGD $400 inclusive are subjected to GST.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7839,Or 16gb
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7839,Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7840,8GB is sufficient.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7840,"but of course, you need to look at what other software and tasks are you going to run on your laptop?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7840,if T495 is your working laptop then having more ram doesn't hurt.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7840,my t495s is my working laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7840,so I went for 16GB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7840,2GB:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7840,Only really found in budget tablet designs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7840,"Fine for them, but youll want more in a laptop or desktop."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7855,so i am unsure what's the issue
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7855,6.0.8750.1 version.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7858,"8GB or 16GB, you need to determine what you are going to use your laptop for."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7858,"If it is light usage, I.e, surfing net, watching shows, and some productivity work, 8GB should suffice."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7858,"If you are looking to use it for some more demanding game or application, best to top it up to 16GB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7858,The amount of memory is shared between the CPU and GPU.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7861,"Mine exactly same as ur version number, also got AMD High def"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7861,the intel driver was for my wireless or bluetooth; dunno whether its the one causing the problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7861,"Anyway, when open device manager->audio output->my driver version same as holocast and also managed by AMD"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7861,I suspect the AMD kit driver update caused the problem because that's around the period i noticed something wrong with speaker and no other updates
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7861,tried this
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7861,but volume level still same...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7861,i thought this setting is when u using microphone to speak during calls and it will reduce background noise..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo,Thinkpad,7861,"For you, it resolved the issue?"

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7901,The news finally came.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7901,It was supposed to be last week because reviewers were under embargo...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7901,I thought it would be sooner than now.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7902,When would it be available in Singapore
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7903,Tomorrow our time.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7903,It's stated in the newsroom today US time
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7904,Should be soon.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7904,Though the website stated available for purchase today according to SG Apple Newsroom.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7904,All Things  Pro on the HardwareZone Forums app
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7905,Whoa the $3999 model actually more worth it
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7905,than last gen given that it gives a more powerful GPU and double the storage.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7906,I think overall the price points still maintain the same from the previous models and configurations.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7906,All Things
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7906, Pro on the HardwareZone Forums app
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7907,That’s very true
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7907,Who’s hooting?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7907,Sicssor keyboard is the game changer
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7908,So far I prefer the butterfly keyboard.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7909,Inverted T directional keys and PHYSICAL escape key!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7910,Not really.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7910,The 16” has double the storage and GPU of Vega
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7910,20 level of last gen.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7910,Oh and faster RAM too.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7911,Are you getting it?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7912,"16gb is not good enough for video exporting, still refuse to bring back sd card slot too, kinda sad, also have to wait to see if overheating is still an issue."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7913,Re-designed airflow.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7914,Still using my 2015 MBP with scissors mechanism keys.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7914,So far so good.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7914,But lately spent a bit too much on Apple hardware
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7914,so need to stop a while.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7915,Will have to wait and see how effective.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7916,Guess I am holding off this one.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7916,Completely based on the keyboard alone.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7916,"At the most, I will consider the 2019 15"" one with the Butterfly mechanism."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7917,May I ask what do you usually use MBP for?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7918,Writing code.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7919,Next year 14” should be a new design.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7920,Feb/Mar 2020?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7921,More likely towards WWDC where new design for both 14” and 16” with 11th Gen and 10th Gen Processor respectively.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7921,This 16” to me is just a stop gap.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7922,Don’t find the need at the moment as my 2013 MacBook Pro still serve me well.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7922,As long as still supports the latest MacOS can already.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7923,Hope it comes with scissor mechanism too!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7923,Cant
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7923,wait!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7924,those who bought the highest end 15inch for the past 5 months really bang wall
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7925,will wait for Intel 10th Gen CPU.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7926,It will definitely.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7927,Haha last one month still got reason to ask Apple for a return and get the 16” model.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7928,It is stated in the announcement text.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7929,no keynote.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7929,but this is the closest we can
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7929,get~
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7929,not sure what the dude did to get to talk to Phil Schiller.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7929,but good on him.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7930,Oh they announced the 14 MacBook Pro already?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7930,Do you have a link for that?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7930,Cant seemed to find it
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7931,Only 16 inch MacBook Pro
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7931,"and it comes with the scissors keyboard, but no news or new models on the 13 or 14 inch models."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7931,All Things
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7931, Pro on the HardwareZone Forums app
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7932,No no.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7932,Referring to the part you said you hope is scissors mechanism.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7932,Sorry.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7932,I read wrongly earlier.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7933,Any idea roughly when the preorder start ?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7933,I saw the news wrote today
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7933,but doesnt seems like it
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7934,Maybe have to wait tomorrow
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7934,9am liao
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7935,us time i think?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7936,"With the announcement of this, alot of good bargains in the refurbished section."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7936,Haha
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7937,For example?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7938,I just got my MacBook Pro 15” i9 1TB Vega 20 like 3 weeks ago.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7938,Planning to return and get the $3999 16” model.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7938,The performance gain should be at least 20%
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7939,I thought return only within 14 days?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7940,Cannot return liao
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7941,No worries
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7941,"bro, you got my hopes up"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7941,haha! 😂
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7942,Apple can always make an exception when there is a new product launch within a certain time frame.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7943,I wrote to Apple SG Press Relations.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7943,They apologised for the confusion as the press release was changed from available today to coming soon.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7943,They just said keep an eye out on Apple.com/sg for availability.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7944,You just got the 13 right
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7944,Maybe can consider this.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7944,Bigger screen for productivity
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7944,But if u like portability just stick to 13
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7945,that’s very bad news
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7945,Thanks for letting us know
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7946,Which config you getting?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7946,Max out ahh
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7947,I think the 3999 model more worth
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7947,leh
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7947,1tb and better gpu.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7947,Will be getting edu price also.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7947,Hopefully tmr morning can order
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7948,Not upgrading to 32GB RAM or GPU to the 8GB model?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7949,That's annoying -
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7949,I saw the original press release and have refreshed the store page a few times a day since then expecting them to be available.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7949,"Looks like we are going to have to wait, although I wouldn't expect it to be longer than a week or two."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7950,Ya I prefer 13 size.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7950,16 too big for me
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7950,Anyway I will be getting a refurb set and return my recent purchase.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7950,"The refurb set has better specs in terms of cpu, ram, ssd, ports etc."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7950,FOR THE SAME PRICE!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7951,The base 16-inch model is now available to order on apple.com/sg.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7951,"Try to configure a build-to-order model though, delivery goes to 02 Jan 2020, and then the MacBook disappears from your bag."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7952,"Fully spec out Macbook 16 inch cost S$8,619"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7953,"They've changed that already it seems, now any customization AT"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7953,"ALL makes 'shipping unavailable', so it seems right now"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7953,it's base model only.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7953,Anyone know if they have demo units at the store yet
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7953,", I know they don't have them in-stock for delivery, but I'd like to see the thing before throwing $4k at it."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7954,Even adding Final Cut to the base model makes it unavailable.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7954,I assume its a problem with the website.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7955,Your bag is empty.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7955,anyways 32GB RAM config:
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7955,"S$4,059.00"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7955,sigh..
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7955,so expensive.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7955,will wait for reviews.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7956,Overkill
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7957,"Just tried the 1tb, i9 processor and 8gb gpu option but nothing in cart"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7958,base model available on 22-Nov.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7958,guess thats the same day it will be available for demo.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7959,Usually MacBook Pro can last at least 5 years especially now that the keyboard is no longer the problematic butterfly one.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7960,Cant seems to decide whether to go for the refurbished 15inch base model or wait for 16inch
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7961,16 inch edu price
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7961,No need think
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7962,Refurbished still save alot more
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7962,but I just concern whether to risk with the butterfly switch
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7962,hahaha
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7963,It comes with 4 years keyboard warranty.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7964,the butterfly keyboard is not for everyone.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7964,i tried it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7964,buttons seemed bigger.. but also flatter and closer to the frame.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7964,and it's noisy.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7964,did they take cue/reference from mechanical keyboard~?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7965,Think they have already fixed the kb issues.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7965,Now is just a matter of taste and preference.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7965,"I can’t stand the butterfly ones, have to rely on Bt keyboard and a laptop stand"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7965,"16 inch price is about the same as the previous 15, and refurbished in few months should be the same as the price u r seeing for 15."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7965,Buying a 16 would mean better resale value in the future as well since majority dreaded the butterfly kb.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7966,yeah.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7966,then add Apple Care: S$549.00.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7966,jesus~
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7967,"consider the improved thermal too, and reviewers have been saying that fans are quiet and not kicking in too much versus the previous 15."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7967,"And many more like the improved speakers, etc,."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7967,value proposition is way higher
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7968,I dont think can purchase leh.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7968,Does it need student
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7968,id
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7968,verification?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7969,Can purchase
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7970,It is showing available at Apple store on 25th nov
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7971,can customized to 32GB RAM and add to bag liaoz.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7971,Order today.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7971,Delivers on 22/11/2019 - 25/11/2019.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7971,or should i wait for Intel 10th
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7971,Gen~?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7971,i think mid or even Q1 2020
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7971,we should be seeing that refresh.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7971,ugh...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7972,It’s much cheaper than last gen which tops up at 4TB and 32GB of RAM.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7973,Any one who went to Apple store yet?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7973,Are the MacBook up on the display?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7974,Can buy from US.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7974,Some stores already discounted.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7974,More worth it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7975,Air freight would be expensive and GST at customs?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7976,And they give u US plug
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7976,Not so worth it la
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7977,Whooo just arranged a return for my MBP 15”.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7977,Gonna get there
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7977,16” model next week!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7978,US plug is more elegant bro
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7978,haha
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7979,Not until when u plug into a protruding travel adapter
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7980,"My current 13"" 2015 model is an Australian plug."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7980,The design makes the plug very pointy.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7981,I don’t really see the big deal with butterfly keyboard actually
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7982,Congrats!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7982,I think you will love the 16
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7983,Has anyone seen the new models at any of the two stores yet?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7984,Just came back from jewel apple store.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7984,Not yet
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7985,Nope.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7985,Think 25th then have
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7986,Okay.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7986,Thanks guys.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7987,a bit useless unless it can improve battery
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7987,life~
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7988,So anyone here has one already?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7989,"Funny is, it’s already on sales in the US."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7990,Earliest for anyone to get in sg will be 22nd
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7991,base model can be picked up in store
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7992,"Yes, just checked."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7992,Can pick up today.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7992,The base model is already very powerful.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7992,I think more than enough for many people.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7993,This or Alienware M15?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7994,My goodnessssss
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7995,Went down to orchard Apple display set is up to try out
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7996,Just got my set
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7997,Congrats!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7997,The base model?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7998,Yes just the base model is available.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7998,Gotta cancel my 1tb model
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7999,congrats!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,7999,I just got the base model too
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8000,How does the keyboard feel?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8000,Scissors > butterfly for many folks.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8000,But Scissors 1mm travel ....
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8001,"I tried both scissors and butterfly, but scissors felt so much better than butterfly because of the tactile feedback"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8002,Congrats all.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8002,Make me jealous and impulsive now.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8002,Hahahha
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8003,Way better.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8003,But the 16 like a bit too big and heavy when I try the 13 just now in store
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8004,Wait until 14” come out or my current MacBook Pro with Retina display cannot receive latest MacOS software then buy.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8004,16” too big for my liking.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8004,Hopefully the escape key and the keyboard goes to next generation 13 or 14”
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8004,Both my MacBook Pro and MacBook Pro with Retina Display are 13”
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8005,"This new 16"" revert of the keyboard to the 2015 design makes my 2015 model 'valuable' again."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8006,Enjoying it
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8007,Congrats bro and enjoy it to the max!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8007,"I still can't justify upgrading my current mid 2015 15"" MBP as it's still going strong, battery still good so far."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8007,"Only thing, no touch bar."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8008,Tbh I rather they remove the Touch Bar.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8008,Don’t find it intuitive.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8008,Speaker does sound better.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8008,Keyboard tactile.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8008,Hope to get used to the side
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8009,Was at Jewel and the new MBP 16 inch is also available.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8009,"Wow, the keyboard does felt very solid."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8009,I kinda like it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8009,"In my opinion, the tactileness is much better/higher as compared to the 2016-2019."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8009,Shall try it later in the month/or next month and see how the keyboard wears out.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8010,It’s better for you to upgrade to that 8GB GPU for just $140.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8011,All MBPs are awesome laptops.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8011,"Perhaps because I don't own any MBP that have the touch bar, hence it's new to me."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8011,"I've yet to try the keyboard, see how it compares to mine."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8011,"But I wished Apple brought back the illuminated Apple logo, because the 2015 model is the last one that has it."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8012,Went down to Apple to try the MacBook.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8012,The keyboard has convinced me to get it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8012,It’s an in between my personal 2015 scissors one and my 2017 butterfly work one.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8012,I like it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8012,The Touch ID button now feels more like an on and off button.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8012,I would have gotten the base model
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8012,but here’s a question to you folks.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8012,Is 16GB suffice or at least 32GB for future proofing.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8012,Upgrading from a 13” 2015 to 16” model now.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8012,excited
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8013,really depend what u using it for.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8013,are u facing a lot of slow down on ur current setup?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8013,"if photo/video editing, 32GB RAM would be recommended."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8014,I opt for 16gb because so far most programmes 8gb is more than enough unless you are doing heavy tasking like programming etc..
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8014,"Compare to your 13"" 2015, is the ram enough for you?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8015,8GB for the current.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8015,Definitely not enough.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8015,16GB seems to be okay.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8015,32GB will be future proof for the next 5 years+.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8015,Still deciding if it’s really worth to top up $504 for it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8016,"Heck, i find 8gb ram like quite taxing for my usual stuff"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8016,No hardcore processing by the way.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8016,"Just email, running 2 whatsapp, webpages etc."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8016,16gb should be the minimum
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8017,Thanks for your contribution.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8017,Definitely helping me to decide for the 32GB at this rate.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8018,Saw it available in store.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8018,Couldn’t think straight.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8018,Think for my usage should be sufficient.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8018,Save some moolah.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8018,Got 2 weeks to play with.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8018,"If really need an upgrade, can just return."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8018,Very happy with the set.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8018,Gonna keep this for a quite awhile
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8019,Yes this is the best MacBook Pro since the 2015 model haha
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8020,I dont do video editing but photo editing and 16GB is sufficient.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8020,If video maybe 32GB.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8021,"Does anyone know when the 8core i9, 1TB model be available for buying in store?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8021,"It seems to be the most reasonably priced upgrade from base model, I have ever seen from Apple."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8022,Should be $560 right?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8023,I am currently using a 8GB MacBook Pro 2017.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8023,"Able to run Photoshop, WhatsApp, Xcode, Safari and Chrome all at the same time with no issue."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8023,Just that compiling project not so fast
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8023,but I think there is more to do with the processing power.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8023,I feel 32GB necessary if you running 1-2 VMs in addition to your normal tasks.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8023,I am trying to convince myself to get the 16GB one..
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8024,I thought it should be more or less the same from the base model after adding the upgrades?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8025,"32GB for video, 16GB for photo editing."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8025,no point having more if not using it much.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8025,unless the cost is not so huge for the Ram increase.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8025,else 16GB really more than enuff.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8026,I’m buying from education store.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8026,I got the legit documents to verify if they need it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8027,"I find 32GB RAM more for those who do intense graphical work, else 16GB is more than enough."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8027,16GB now is also the norm too.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8027,Posted with Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max HardwareZone Forums app
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8028,Nah even 1-2 VMs is enough with 16GB RAM.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8028,It’s a Mac not a PC by the way.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8029,You can’t upgrade to 2.3Ghz CPU from the base model
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8029,so
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8029,yeah
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8029,the $3999 is priced reasonably.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8030,Which VM did you test this with?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8030,Parallels or VMware Fusion?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8031,"If you buy base model and add the cpu, gfx card and storage upgrades, it costs 4279$."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8031,So you save 280$ by buying the 3999$ model.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8031,Anyway I have bought it today.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8031,This model is available in Apple store at Orchard.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8031,Got it in space grey.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8031,My first Mac.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8031,Have upgraded from Surface Book 1.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8032,Yes cos you saved by not going to the 2.4Ghz CPU directly
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8032,which is the only CPU the $3299 model able to upgrade to.

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8032,Apple doesn’t allow you to go with 512GB with 2.3Ghz CPU.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8032,They are smart indeed with the config.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8033,Personally I think Parallels is the best for the Mac.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8033,The integration is very seamless.

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8038,The dilemma for 16GB or 32GB is real.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8038,First world problem.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8039,Yes got it for that price
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8039,Super worth it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8039,Considering 2019 13’ 512gb is already about 2.8
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8040,Video editor?

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8048,Buy middle specs will do...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8048,after awhile come out new models again
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8049,Check out the review of the base model.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8050,Wrong.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8050,Buy what you need.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8050,If you need 64GB with 5500M 8GB 4TB SSD go for it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8050,Every year will have new release but MacBook generally can last unless you use it to earn a living.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8050,6 months later will have a new MacBook Pro 16” with intel 10-gen processor and
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8050,Wifi6.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8050,How do you keep up?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8050,It’s not a phone.

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8053,"I wonder how many of you guys are really using it to full potential, i.e, video processing / programming etc"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8054,I buy it to surf YouTube at Starbucks.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8054,"Wondering 16gb enough or not, or should I up to 32gb"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8054,so I can watch 4K at Starbucks
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8055,64GB.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8055,Watch 8K.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8056,That’s why my MacBook Pro use from 2013 until now never change.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8056,Wait until cannot upgrade to latest Mac OS then change
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8057,Just went to try out the 16 MBP at Jewel Apple Store.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8057,"Overall beautiful machine with gorgeous display, the scissors mechanisms tactile feedback also slightly different from my 2015 15 MBP."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8057,"Theres also a 2.4GHz 8-core i9 with 32GB RAM, 8GB 5500 graphics and 2TB SSD config, going for $5538 which is not stated in Apples website."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8058,Yup a bit different
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8059,Perhaps mines the old type while this is the improved type.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8060,The improved one seems to have less key travel.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8061,"Most probably, but the tactile feedback is good."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8061,So far among the best.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8062,I do prefer the lesser key travel.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8062,The 16” MacBook Pro has convinced me.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8063,It’s available to order online too.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8063,You have to self build to this config.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8063,Same price $5538.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8063,This is the config most Pro will go with.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8064,"But seems overkill for the average user, the $3999 config should suffice."

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8072,"On my current machine already can manage well, so can imagine the 16""!"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8072,"But only thing is, drain batt quite fast."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8073,The base model looks attractive enough.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8073,Totally beaten the 2019 15-inch gao gal and again cheaper with so many improved features.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8074,"Specs definitely better, but I find the base model should also use Core i9."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8075,Yes I was wondering why battery drain so fast.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8075,Hopefully not just me
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8076,"Lightroom for example, uses quite a bit of RAM for editing photos and internal fan revs up and temperature goes up, hence draining the battery."

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8077,Wow.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8077,You guys are all paying educational pricing ah.

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8129,"But for Mac, it’s going to be a long term investment"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8129,so AppleCare+ is critical given you can’t replace most of the parts yourself.

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8147,Buy already and feel bad.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8148,Wah.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8148,You want to return for a rumor?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8148,Minimum need to wait for one more year even if it is true.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8148,This version is very well received so dont
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8148,they will be so keen to refresh it so quickly.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8149,I just feel no point to return.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8149,This one is probably the most stable one since it’s design.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8149,Next design might come in a mess
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8150,Agree.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8150,"Just like the 2015 MacBook Pro which is their best and most stable iteration until 2016, they itchy finger, introduce the butterfly keyboard, Touch Bar etc. 😂"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8151,I think the biggest value to upgrade from my 13” 2015 one is the Touch ID.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8151,It bought me so much convenience.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8152,There will be a refresh definitely to the 10th Gen Intel Processor and more powerful GPU.

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8161,the waiting game is no joke.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8161,Rather keep and use if new one comes by then sell and ‘upgrade’
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8162,"I got the 8 core, 1TB one"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8163,Sorry for the noob qns but cant seem to find the right thread for this..
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8163,Anyone got recommendations for the usb hub/ports?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8164,Recommend this
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8165,I’ll recommend this.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8166,Nice this is a new product released not Long ago.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8166,Should be around 150 after shipping
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8167,Thanks for the recommendations!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8167,Is there any that is connect directly at the side of the laptop?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8167,Means no cable involved..
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8167,cuz my portable hdd alr got cable 😅 if nt v messy
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8168,This one go for hyper
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8169,Yeap I agree.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8169,Else go for Satechi.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8169,The 2 more reputable brands.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8170,I recommend hyperdrive too.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8170,I am using the 9 in 1 one.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8170,But has a cable dangling though.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8171,Anyone experienced popping sound in the speakers when you stop an audio track Spotify or close a youtube video when it is playing?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8171,It doesn't affect me much but still unsettles me.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8172,Yes.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8172,"On my 16"" Macbook Pro."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8172,I have already sent feedback to
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8173,Yea I googled and found this to be a common issue unfortunately.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8173,Can update if they get back to you?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8173,I need the laptop for my exams over the next 2 weeks
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8173,so I can’t bring it down to Apple Store to check yet.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8174,Yes a lot of cracking sound
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8175,My friend also confirmed can hear.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8175,Hopefully it is just an issue that can be solved with software update.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8175,Else there will a major recall for a this excellent MacBook.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8176,No need to bring down.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8176,"Even if you go for a replacement, likely to get back one with the same issue."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8177,does the cracking sound last very long or jus a split second type~?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8178,"It happens in a split second, when I close a YouTube video for instance."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8178,It doesn’t affect my workflow whatsoever
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8178,but it’s definitely loud and annoying.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8178,I read that it occurs frequently for those using FCP to edit videos.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8179,Okay.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8179,Keeping my 16” and trading in with brightstar for my 13” 2015 one.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8179,Bought in Australia so it came with an Australian plug head.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8180,How much is Brightstar offering you?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8181,Around $300+
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8182,What are the specs?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8183,I cannot remember in detail .
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8183,It’s the basic 13” 2015 pro model.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8183,8GB RAM.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8183,No graphics card
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8184,I asked because a relative of mine managed to sell his 13” retina 2013 for $400 on carsousell a couple of months back.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8185,Older MacBook Pro really convenient with the ports available
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8186,Carousell probably can fetch higher price but must be prepared to meet all sort of buyers including those last minute no show or bargain on the spot.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8186,Some have expectations whatever you are selling to be in a perfect condition like brand new even though it is few years ago.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8186,BrightStar is more straightforward and save you time and frustration of dealing with such buyers.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8187,Get used to it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8187,Soon there will be no ports
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8188,Thats also one of the reason why I dont wish to change my 2015 MBP yet.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8189,No USB ports jin Sian
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8190,My favourite mouse requires USB port.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8190,Older macbook feel more sturdy also and the Apple logo does light up.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8190,I find the older kb more tactile too
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8191,You summed up the reasons why I am lazy to deal with Carousell buyers.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8192,"Hey all, another Student here..."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8192,"I'm seriously considering getting the 16"" MBP now."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8192,"But if I get it, bootcamp must function just as well as a typical windows 10 laptop."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8192,This is because my school is predominately a windows-only environment.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8192,Most softwares of my course are exclusive to windows only.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8192,I can't get a windows laptop as my photography/filmmaking hobby heavily relies on Mac OS.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8192,Photoshop + FCPX user
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8192,"So, have anyone tried bootcamp before?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8192,"I heard that the dedicated Radeon Graphics is forever switched-on, hence draining the battery significantly faster compared to Mac OS."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8192,Correct me if I'm wrong
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8193,You might want to use a VM like Parallels instead of running Bootcamp.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8194,Just got hands on the 16 inch MacBook Pro at i Studio just now
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8194,I used the 13 inch compare to 16 inch like no difference
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8194,The keyboard feels like the same as 13 inch just ticker that’s all.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8195,VM will struggle as the windows programs I use are CPU + GPU intensive.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8195,eg.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8195,3D Modelling with 3DS Max & Revit
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8195,"Btw, these Radeon 5000M series graphics work way better than the GTX1650s that are found on most windows laptops."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8195,They're very much optimised for workstation use.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8195,That's why I'm so inclined to go for Macs even though they're not windows native devices.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8196,I find VM too laggy for me...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8196,bootcamp is my preference.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8196,Running bootcamp has it pros and cons.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8196,"Macbook pro is a very solid hardware, so far never have a BSOD."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8196,Compared to my other new i9 Lenovo which BSOD at least once a day.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8196,"The downside, it runs hot and the fan spin-up very quickly even on light loads."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8196,"Guess its the combination of win 10 and driver issues e.g, unable to turn off the GFX when idling."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8196,"Now matter how it drains the battery, it still outlast the lenovo."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8196,The retina screen is the sharpest and best color accurate one...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8196,"Till today, in my opinion MBP is the best non-gaming win10 laptop money can buy ignoring the lack of ports, and weight..."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8196,"But if you just run MS office, its an overkill and waste of $$$."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8197,Interesting...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8197,May I know what's battery life like for both the Lenovo and MBP?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8197,When the MBP is in bootcamp mode of course
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8197,"Also, is your MBP a 15"" model with discrete graphics?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8198,I agree on the keyboard.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8198,I currently use Magic Keyboard 2 from my 5K iMac.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8198,"The 16"" MBP ones still lack the key travel of the 5K iMac ones."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8198,"In short, they're deeper than the 2016 MBP but shallower than the 5K iMac."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8198,Still a little uncomfortable IMO.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8198,"Oh, one thing to note is that the 16"" screen is 100 nits dimmer than it's predecessor."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8198,Approx 410nits
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8198,So false marketing there from Apple.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8199,"For those who have purchased the 16"" MBP:
Are they Malaysian sets?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8199,You can check it out on the outer box packaging.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8199,My previous purchase from Apple.sg was a Malaysian one.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8199,"So I thought if those in the stores are SG ones, it""ll be better to pick it up than to get it delivered."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8199,I'm asking this
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8199,cuz I need a valid 1 year SG warranty.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8199,Won't be purchasing AC+ as it's not worth it
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8200,If they can bring back the keyboard from MacBook Pro with Retina display that will be good.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8200,I still using the 13” MacBook Pro with Retina Display from 2013 and still loving it
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8200,That is still the best MacBook Pro keyboard I have ever used
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8201,have you considered XPS 15?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8201,Or XPS 13 for u prefer a small form factor
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8201,Posted from Hell B18 HardwareZone Forums
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8201,app
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8202,What Malaysian set?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8202,Don’t get it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8203,Pretty sure Malaysian sets also can get it serviced in Singapore
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8204,It just happen so MY and SG are sharing the same model configurations plugs and etc and
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8204,"thus, the same packaging, for both countries."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8204,So don’t have to worry if AppleCare doesn’t cover.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8204,It does cover in SG and internationally too.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8204,All Things
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8204, Pro on the HardwareZone Forums app
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8205,I think you might not have known.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8205,Even a US set can be service in Singapore.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8205,SG and Malaysia set shared the same model number
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8205,so doesn’t matter if it’s Singapore or Malaysia set.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8205,Both are the same.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8205,"And for the screen brightness, you are wrong."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8205,"In fact, the screen this year is lightly brighter than last year model."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8206,"Its as good as asking apple to remove the touchbar, or adding a sdcard reader ;-."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8206,"Passby an apple shop near my house, test drive the 16"" MBP keyboard"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8206,"seems more ""firm"" then previous version, but still mallow compared to the best in class keyboard from lenovo."

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8206,just maybe...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8207,XPS are the best looking windows laptop i think
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8208,How is MacBook not the nicest looking laptop?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8208,It’s designed by Jony Ive even.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8209,Best looking windows laptop will be MacBook Pro running bootcamp
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8210,"Yes, but I need Mac OS to run FCPX especially."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8211,"Cool, didn't know that standard 1 year warranty is international warranty."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8212,"As much as possible I""ll stay away from Dell because their after sales service is basically non-existent."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8212,They don't even have an official warehouse in SG and all purchases from the flagship store have to be back-ordered and shipped from Malaysia.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8212,"IMO, the Surface Book 2 is the nicest looking windows laptop."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8212,"But it costs slightly more than the 16"" MBP with a dated and underpowered CPU+GPU."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8212,2017
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8212,Hardware
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8212,"So now I'm left with Apple MBP 16""."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8212,It's marginally cheaper than the Dell and Microsoft.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8212,"Plus, I study overseas and global warranty coverage certainly helps a lot."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8213,Hi guys anyone using it for data science work?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8213,"I'm thinking of going for 2.3 i9 8 core, 64 GB ram and 1 TB."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8213,Should I take 5500 4 GB or 8 GB?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8213,Sent from HUAWEI VOG-L29 using GAGT
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8214,"For data science, you don’t need GPU."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8214,Just focus on CPU and RAM.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8215,Don’t have to go until 64gb.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8215,32 is sweet spot for many editors
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8215,5500 4gb to 8gb is a $100
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8215,=+ jump If u wanna max out the graphics
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8216,Is it better to run parallel or bootcamp
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8217,You don’t need 64GB for data science work.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8217,32GB is more than enough.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8218,It depends on usage.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8218,Can always try parallels first before doing bootcamp.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8219,"For data science work, you can go for a maxed out 13"" MacBook Pro."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8219,"Then, invest on a solid monitor like the LG 5K UltraFine Display or the upcoming Apple XDR Display."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8219,Launching in December.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8219,"16"" display won't do justice for data stuff."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8219,"You""ll need a much larger canvas."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8219,"27"" or 32"" monitor preferably."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8220,That's what I thought.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8220,Cos
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8220,my games also don't really use much gpu lol.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8220,Just that sometimes I do Photoshop and Lightroom
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8220,I think should be fine right.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8220,Should I go 2.4 i9 processor with 5300 4gb or 2.3 i9 5500 4gb ?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8220,Thanks guys
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8220,but I was using Thinkpad T series with 32gb ram and
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8220,it's getting slow when I'm transforming huge dataset.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8220,So I thought 64 might ease the load in the long run.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8220,I have monitor.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8220,Actually more for on the go too when running overseas and no monitor.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8220,Battery life is impt.

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8221,"In general, the higher the ram, the higher the power consumption."

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8222,"If battery life is a concern, can get a powerbank for laptop."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8222,There are some powerbank with PD and USB-C that can charge USB-C laptop.

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8222,Posted from Hell B18 HardwareZone Forums app
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8223,You should go for 2.3Ghz model with 64GB RAM and 5500M 4GB GPU.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8223,This should suit your usage.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8223,You need that H processor instead of the U processor found in 13”.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8223,That additional GHz in the 2.4Ghz doesn’t justify the $200+ increase.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8223,"Then again, $140 upgrade to"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8223,8GB GPU is worth it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8224,I have tried the Xiaomi powerbank gen 3 20k mah which supports 45W pd.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8224,Still a bit slow to charge since this laptop comes with a 96w brick.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8224,Searched high and low but most powerbanks with wattage of 60W and above are like about $200..
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8224,until I found zmi powerpack 20k
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8224,pro which gives out 65W and only costs $90.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8224,Gets the juice up fast as well.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8224,Omni 20c is good also but too expensive.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8224,Does anyone know if we can plug in 97w brick into Ravpower 20100 mAh Powerbank that has a 3 pin UK port.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8225,May not be necessary translate to better performance with 64GB Ram.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8225,Suspect it's the I/O bottleneck
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8225,...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8225,What's your task manager committed and cache memory values under peak load?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8226,I got the zendure one which can charge up to 100W along with the power adapter which can juice up the Powerbank in 100W in just an hr.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8227,How much and from where?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8227,If too expensive maybe won’t consider.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8227,since the laptop doesn’t charge at full 96W throughout

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8247,but now no longer the case.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8248,"Still can't find anyone selling 16"" MBP keyboard cover."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8248,"Have anyone tried putting a Non-Retina MBP keyboard cover with the inverted T arrow keys into the new 16"" MBP?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8248,Does it fit?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8248,"If so, I might take that and nicely trim off the function keys of the cover."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8249,No the dimension are totally different.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8249,You can get the cover from Taobao.

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8250,Won’t be needing it if using Razer core x chroma..
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8250,too bad
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8250,it’s too expensive.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8251,Come to think of it..
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8251,the 5500 graphics card that come with it already quite sufficient.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8251,Comparable to Vega 64.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8251,Maybe can’t fight with Radeon vii.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8252,Nah it’s not comparable to Vega 64.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8252,Still like 40% off
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8252,but it’s much better than Vega 20 from last gen.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8253,The incentive to get a egpu would be very low for most if it is 40% off.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8253,Vega 64
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8253,+ egpu already 1k
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8254,i just hope there is an SD card reader
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8255,Won’t happen.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8255,Can forget about it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8256,no turning back.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8256,centralizing the ports USB-C means cheaper to manufacture for Apple.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8256,"lesser parts to fail, cheaper to repair overall."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8256,Apple did had
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8256,"a
to push USB-C proposal."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8256,i am still on the fence.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8256,still got to buy a USB-C hub.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8256,jin mafan~
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8257,I know there's quite a few base model buyers here
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8257,"but out of curiosity, did anyone actually buy this exact config?"

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8258,Not exactly the same
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8258,but I bought it with the following:
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8258,2.4Ghz i9
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8258,16GB RAM Might return and upgrade to 32GB.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8258,5500M 8GB.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8258,512GB
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8259,"Cool, how's it like living with 16GB ram?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8259,$500 savings is quite a lot of $$$.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8259,Haha.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8260,16GB not enough for your usage?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8261,Anyone bought hyperdrive 6 in 2?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8261,I got one..
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8261,and i find that it's really loose..
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8261,not sure if anyone else thinks the same?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8262,Gain City Online selling base model at $3182 and higher specs at $3636.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8263,Wow.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8263,Great price..
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8263,I think even lower than educational price.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8263,How did they manage to do it?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8263,Is it a Black Friday sale?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8264,Just ordered 2.3Ghz

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8264,Apple states that it will be delivered from 6th-9th December.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8264,Anyone knows whether they tend to home deliver earlier than scheduled for custom configurations?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8265,"From what I know, no."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8265,Apple usually don’t deliver earlier unless there is a change in circumstances.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8265,May I ask what you use your MacBook for?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8265,The specs looks high-end.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8266,Omg wtf.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8266,Thats a damn good deal leh.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8266,Trying to sell away my late 2017 15 model before I can buy the new one.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8266,😭
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8267,Ok thanks for the info!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8267,"Will mainly be using it for 4K Video Editing, 42MP Raw Photo Editing, and 3D Modelling of high-rise buildings."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8267,"Autocad, Revit, Rhino, 3Ds Max, Maya, Photoshop, FCPX & After Effects"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8267,"Hence, I""ll be dual booting as some apps are only exclusive to either of the OS."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8267,"Anyway if I find the specs overkill, if I'm not wrong, I can return and get a lower specced one."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8267,"We""ll see."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8268,Your work seems fit for the specs mentioned.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8268,You’ll be fine with what you have ordered I think.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8269,Which usb hub did u guys get?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8269,Ugreen or baseus?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8269,Posted with  iPhone 11 PRO
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8269, HardwareZone Forums app
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8270,Didn’t get any.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8270,But would choose Baseus if I have to.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8271,I have been using dodocool for about 2 years now.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8271,"It's very reliable, compact and light."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8271,"However, it runs warm when only 1 peripheral is connected."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8271,eg.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8271,4K HDMI @
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8271,60HZ
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8271,I guess this is normal as these hubs aren't directly powered from a socket.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8271,P.s.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8271,You can't go wrong with Ugreen and Baseus too.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8271,They're solid brands.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8272,"Bro, why not get the i9 2.4Ghz, 2TB, 32GB RAM, 5500M 8GB config and you can get it almost immediately?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8273,Isn't that a custom configuration that is only available online?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8273,I just cannot justify the $200 1Ghz base clock difference.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8273,2TB is nice for dual booting
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8273,but I'm a student and opting for the i9 1TB config
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8273,is as good as buying a motorbike liao.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8273,"In fact, I'm even considering returning the 2.3Ghz i9 MBP for a slower model."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8273,"i7, 32GB DDR4, 1TB SSD, 5300M 4GB"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8273,"But I""ll have to test it out."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8273,"If I don't take advantage of the beefy hardware, I might make this move."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8274,Yes that’s a custom build but only that build has it readily available.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8274,i7 processor might not be enough for your 3D modelling though I’m not sure how heavy a user are you.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8275,"Oh cool, The jewel staff didn't tell me such a config is available."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8275,I too can't tell yet on how much power I need.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8275,All I can say is that my i7-7700HQ is always at 100% Utilisation whenever I 3D Model.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8275,But that's a 7th gen quad core processor.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8275,"Have to buy and test the MBP to find out, no choice."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8276,hmm.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8276,"if you are using gfx software that is exclusive to Windows, my suggestion will always to not get a Macbook."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8276,"even though you can dual boot, i used to have thermal issues when playing a 5 years old game."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8276,performance of bootcamp is abit dubious as well.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8276,plus some of those software runs better with CUDA core which is NVIDIA exclusive.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8277,Anyone bought the Caldigit TS3+ docking station?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8277,It has 85W charging but
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8277,"a Caldigit employee mentioned they will release a firmware update by the end of 2019 to cope with the new 96W charging of the 16"" MBP."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8278,A few Apple related outlets reporting this already.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8278,Seems like it is related to Catalina as opposed to hardware?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8279,Likely to be software problem.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8279,It’s almost affecting 90% of the 16” MacBook.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8280,"Just received the 16"" MBP."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8280,Already can hear popping sounds  from the welcome screen by selecting random language sounds.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8280,Should I return it?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8280,"The volume and intensity of the ""Pop"" is highly variable."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8280,Can be really soft or loud.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8281,depends on whether it really is software related.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8281,"if software related, then still can wait."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8281,but isnt the popping sound from a selection of softwares FCP~?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8282,The popping sound sounds more like software issue than hardware.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8283,I don't think it's related to any specific Mac software.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8283,I highly suspect it's either a hardware defect or a Mac OS bug.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8283,Will be installing bootcamp shortly
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8283,", that will confirm whether it's software or hardware related."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8284,same as this one mah~?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8285,Alamak....
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8285,xiao liao....
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8286,This Utuber did some deep dive on the popping issue.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8286,Maybe is good to share here
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8287,"Yes, exactly the same."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8288,"Ok, installed bootcamp."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8288,Popping still exists but it's slightly softer on windows.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8288,Tested on YouTube with Microsoft Edge.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8288,Apple just sent a memo to Apple Staffs to deny replacements as they claim it's a software issue.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8288,I wonder why it exists on Windows 10 then.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8288,Sounds to me like a sound card or wiring issue to 1 of the 6 speakers.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8289,"Apple Investigating 16-Inch MacBook Pro Popping Sound Issue, Fix Planned in Future Software Updates"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8290,Since it can be workaround then a software fix will do.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8291,It’s definitely a software/ driver issue.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8291,Happened before.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8291,Just wait for Apple to release software fix.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8291,No need to be alarm.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8292,Thought this issue is common in the 15’ as well.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8292,Only fixing it when more complain
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8293,"I dont have this problem on my 2015 15 MBP, also running Catalina 10.15.1."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8294,Not all macbooks will have this issue.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8294,Like my 16” doesn’t experience any popping sound.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8295,Let’s see if the macOS 10.15.2 update will fix the problem later.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8295,Many people on the beta have reported that it seemed to be fixed.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8296,2018 15’ one got quite a number of users report.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8296,Saw this.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8296,Somewhat genius design but not digging the look
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8297,Popping issues seemed fixed with macOS 10.15.2 update.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8298,Officially released already ah.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8298,I’ll update it tonight and see if issue has been fixed.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8299,I have not tested.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8299,Just reading from others.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8299,I’ve updated but hopefully it’s fixed.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8300,@7:47th mark.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8300,as expected.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8300,performance is abysmal for Bootcamp.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8301,I just tested it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8301,It’s solved the issue for me.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8301,Hope yours is ok too.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8302,I haven’t tested it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8302,I have no 100% way to reproduce the error.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8302,Mine comes randomly.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8303,hows e new keyboard?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8303,I was at  store just now n tested some typing.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8303,e new key travel is still shallow but better than e previous butterfly keyboard
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8304,I personally like the butterfly keyboard.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8304,But I guess this is a good compromise for the so called “widespread sticky keys” problem.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8304,So it’s perfect for me.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8304,"If you like it, just get it."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8304,I think it’s going to be a stable good MacBook for a while till the new design comes.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8305,16inch is like too big for me
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8305,cos
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8305,I bring it around
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8305,so Ill wait for smaller size.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8306,Oh I see.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8306,Then wait for 14”
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8307,Updated mine to 15.2.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8307,"It's fixed on the Mac OS side but on bootcamp, popping still exists."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8308,"Yeap, bootcamp runs poorly."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8308,But it's simply due to Apple not putting enough effort to optimise their drivers for windows.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8308,The main issue so far is fan management control.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8308,3rd party apps like throttlestop did help a lot for the CPU
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8308,but GPU continues to go bananas.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8308,So the fan speeds can ramp up to 5200rpm despite the overal temp being at 60°C.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8309,Heng never upgrade to 16 lol
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8309,So many probs
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8310,Wtf are you talking about?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8311,Time is bad.

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8314,😆
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8315,Yeah.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8315,Don’t know what’s the problem he mentioned.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8315,Probably is the boot camp thing.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8315,But who buys a mac to install crap OS like Windows?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8316,Get straight from Apple Ma.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8316,Educational price is the cheapest Liao.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8316,Unless they have refurbished + edu
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8317,Refurbished is the cheapest lol.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8317,Wasted the discount cannot stack.

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8325,My 16 MacBook Pro has popping sound watching Netflix on safari when u jump the video....
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8325,I took the standard 1tb config.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8325,Anyone has similar issue?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8325,I tested out a 16 model at epi Center
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8325,no such problem...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8325,Is it fixable by hardware or software issue?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8326,This should be fixed in the latest OS update.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8327,my OS is up to date since day 1.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8327,I still hear the popping.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8327,Anyone watches Netflix on safari?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8327,It only happens when I back up the video or closes it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8327,Not sure if I should send it in...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8327,l
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8328,I have the same MBP as yours.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8328,It's running on the latest 15.2 update and I'm still hearing loud popping sounds on Safari.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8328,"However, all other apps I tested have been resolved."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8328,"If you were to use Chrome, you won't hear any pop."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8328,This is a software issue known on T2 Chip based Macs.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8328,Just wait for 15.3 update and hope for the best.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8329,"chrome is ok, but the resolution is only 720p for Netflix?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8329,also people say chrome is a battery hog...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8329,So I am sticking with safari.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8329,Apple TV app
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8329,also got popping sound....
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8329,even their own app has issues...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8330,"Yes sometimes there would be discounts, but if you want savings; I would recommend you buy refurbished iPads"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8330,instead
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8330,but I digress as this forum is for MacBook Pro 16”
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8331,"Totally agree, chrome is just.. meh..."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8332,"hey guys, when using the 96w charger provided by apple, how fast is your laptop charging?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8332,i am getting 70-90w.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8332,how about yours?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8332,"when i use this charger from anker at work, i get about 60w.."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8332,will bring it home and try to see if it's the sockets at my workplace that has problems
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8333,Guys.

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8335,"just got the 3999 version 3702 after education discount, enjoying it so far, the speakers are really good, installing bootcamp now, will see how it fares in light gaming"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8336,Wah $3702!

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8336,I trying to check gain city if they still have the price as advertised $3709
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8337,Anyone installed screen protector?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8337,Required?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8338,i got the same one at educational pricing too!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8338,loving it
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8339,i don’t think it is needed
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8340,Really tempted to purchase 1 16 inch MBP.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8340,but the thing is i'm not gonna use it to do any video editing or photo editing.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8340,"just gonna be using it casually for entertainment, document writing, presentation slides, excel, emails, etc."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8340,So is it overkill to get 16 inch?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8340,and go for the macbook air?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8340,Personally i would want the 16inch
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8340,but the 3500 is a bit painful.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8340,Advice please?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8341,"If u need the screen size, want the best then go for it."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8341,Macbook lasts for many years.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8341,Think of it as investment
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8342,Refurbished models appearing soon!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8343,heng suay bah..
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8343,definitely doesn't last many years for me
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8343,twice my 2 mbp mobo died after 1 year.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8344,"If, u have ur own desk/room, maybe can consider getting the mbp 13"" or air and connect to a good external monitor?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8344,"seriously, its a waste to spend so much just for bigger screen and casual use."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8345,There are so many other 15.6 inch laptops out there in the market that can do those task at significantly lower price point.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8345,Don't buy this just because it's Apple.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8345,Buy for the work you do.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8346,"For your usage, a MacBook Air will be good enough."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8346,If you want a bigger screen then connect it to an external monitor.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8346,You can save a ton more with external monitor setup.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8347,Buying it cause of the ecosystem of Apple.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8347,The convenience of using Apple.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8347,Other laptops are not iOS unfortunately
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8348,I do have a gaming desktop at home.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8348,But the laptop is mainly to bring to office to use.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8348,Since there’s limited internet access at work and work laptop can only connect to intranet.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8348,Have always find 13 inch to be a little tad small
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8349,My 15’ model since 2013 until now.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8349,Still good.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8349,Even got a USB c to MagSafe charger for it
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8349,I would always recommend getting MAC for his kind of usage.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8349,Not only is the whole system very reliable.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8349,Battery life is solid and more secure than windows.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8349,Can consider waiting for their rumoured 14’ as well since the only lineup with improved keyboard is with the 16’ for now
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8350,how does one buy the macbook pro at education pricing?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8350,"upon paying at the apple education page, do I need to show my student card upon collection?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8351,Google Apple education store.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8351,They won’t ask for student card upon collection if u look like a student
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8351,If u opt for home delivery they might send u an email asking for one just for auditing purposes
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8352,I'm entering uni this July.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8352,I received the letter but haven't accepted yet.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8352,Just incase they ask for proof will that work?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8353,Has the popping sound issues being fixed in the recent updates?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8354,It’s has been fixed like 2 months ago
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8355,You meant my kind of usage?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8355,Haha.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8355,Tried the mbp16 a couple of times at Apple store.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8355,I have to say the speakers are really awesome.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8355,It is definitely a beast.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8355,"Just thinking, whether using such a beast to do excel, ppt and word, surfing and video watching if it’s too overkill."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8355,Haha.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8355,But the Apple ecosystem and the screen size is just too good.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8355,Should I purchase it now?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8355,Or wait for the 2020 mbp16” release?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8356,If you can afford 16’’ just get it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8357,Show them ur matriculation letter.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8358,it’ll be an endless waiting game
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8359,If you can afford it go for it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8359,I code for a living and this Macbook hasn't slipped a beat...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8359,"running multiple instances of VS code, Docker, etc"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8359,the keyboard is also a joy to type on
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8360,it is not fixed...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8360,But I found a workaround.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8360,Set the sampling in Audio Midi Setup to 48 khertz.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8360,My MBP still has popping sound at the default 44.1 khertz.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8360,Try it if yours has popping sound.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8360,such a simple workaround
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8360,", I wished I chance on it sooner."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8361,The next big upgrade should be the mini led display.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8361,"If you can wait for it, why not?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8361,"The generation is pretty big upgrade though with a new form factor, keyboard, speakers."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8361,Plus the regular internals upgrade.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8362,but wouldn't know if they are really releasing Q4 2020
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8362,right?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8362,lol Q4 is a long while to go.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8362,now is only mid Q1!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8362,lol
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8363,I do like my 13.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8363,Note that the MacBook Pro is also heavier by about 0.3 pounds.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8363,"If you have accessories designed to fit the 15-inch MacBook Pro, they may not fit the new 16-inch model."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8364,"And if you have a smaller bag or backpack that snugly fits the 15-inch MacBook Pro, the 16-inch model may be too big."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8364,So just try first.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8365,"Actually there's no much difference between the new 16"" and the older 15""."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8365,Cos they just minimize the bezels for a larger screen.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8366,Updated and no issues with 10.15.3.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8366,Had the pop on my unit with the preinstalled 10.51.1.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8367,Trying to sell off sparkling New macbook 15 2019..
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8367,anybody wanna check it out ?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8367,Haha
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8367,Edit:
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8367,sold my MacBook Pro 15 2019 and bought MacBook Pro 16.. but feels the diff is not significant..
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8368,new MBA with e new scissor keyboard is out
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8369,Any improvement to keyboard?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8369,Hows e typing?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8369,Posted with  HardwareZone Forums
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8369,app
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8370,"Any new users of the MacBook Pro 16"" would like to contribute any reviews?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8370,"I think this thread got buried so deeply that some are leaving reviews on the 13"" thread."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8371,ya i wonder where the thread disappeared to
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8372,"loving the 16""."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8372,really the best macbook ive used to far.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8372,only complaint i have is the weight and size
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8372,but thats the caveat when using so much power.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8372,everything else is great.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8372,the thinner bezels makes the whole thing so immersive.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8372,speakers are fantastic.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8372,typing is great
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8372,took awhile for me to get used to cos
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8372,ive been using butterfly keyboard for
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8372,so long.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8372,"mine is a refurb model, 8-core/1tb/16GB/5500m"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8373,"refurbished, will there be any mild scratches or dings on the exterior or dead pixel on lcd etc....?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8373,cos usually only got issues
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8373,then ppl will return the machine to apple mah.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8374,You can check and if not happy return for another one.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8375,I am eyeing that model too!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8375,Does the fan run noisy frequently?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8375,Did you buy Apple care+?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8376,Im using similar model but configured with 32GB and this thing runs like a beast.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8376,"I ran 4K video in the background while doing editing with AI and also FaceTime call, this MacBook takes everything in its stride."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8376,Fans kicked up but its not loud that it irritates me.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8377,I bought AppleCare+ for mine using the education store.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8377,Buying the refurbished set means like paying the actual retail price with additional savings PLUS the AppleCare - which costs $489 mind you.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8377,It will come with a new outer shell so no scratches
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8377,la.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8377,Returned sets could also be people who bought and returned during the 14-day window period.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8377,"I sent my 15"" for repair last year and Apple did an amazing job replacing the battery and outer shell for me for free when they deducted an issue which wasn't caused by me."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8377,Apple's service is seriously stellar.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8377,Noted that there are people who faced issues with Apple before
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8377,but I've always been lucky since I became a user in 2009.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8377,The fan will be a little more noisy and the area above keyboard more warm only if I turn off graphic switching.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8377,Other than that nah
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8377,I never ever hear the fan unless I turn on Dota 2.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8377,"On a side note, if you're not editing high res video daily, I really think that the amd 5500m 8gb will be an overkill...."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8378,Wow.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8378,The 32GB upgrade cost $600 more.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8378,Guess it is worth it if you are making money from it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8379,apple refurbs are as good as new.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8379,i'm super anal when it comes to things like dings and scratches....
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8379,none of the sort at all....perfectly MINT
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8380,going to use it for a few more days
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8380,and then i'll get apple care.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8380,making sure that there is no issues before i get it...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8380,fans only kicked in during indexing and rendering.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8380,"the thing you gotta realise is, there are two kinds of fan noise...."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8380,the screeching turbo jet engine kind from windows based machines and then the kind from macs which is a lower frequency and doesn't annoy me as much.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8381,"on the refurb store now, you can get the upgraded model thats $4.7k at retail for $3.9k now."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8381,thats MASSIVE savings for a crazy ass beast laptop.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8381,i was tempted by it
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8381,but i'm saving the $$ for now cos
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8381,there is a good chance that i'll upgrade to the next upgrade when/if its got mini-led displays.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8382,I just got UAG Hard Casing for Macbook Pro 16 yesterday arrived.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8383,Good decision.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8383,"I think Mini-LED if ever coming to MBP, will take at least 2 years."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8383,Macbook or MacBook Air will get them first.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8384,It is alive again!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8384,"Still a very good computer despite the release of a new toy 10 gen MacBook Pro 13""."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8385,Its definitely coming next year along with a refreshed design and processor.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8385,Keep a look out for it
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8386,this is the only reason why i've not gone for a 32gb model.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8386,just waiting for a revolutionary re-design.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8386,"the design of the 16"" gives me confidence"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8387,"If it is a re-design, it is better not to go for the first iteration."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8387,"I think you can safely use your 16"" for 3 years before investing in a new and more mature version."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8388,"The MBP 16"" sounds like a dyson fan tower AM07 but in auto-breeze mode."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8389,haha yes exactly!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8389,"its loud but not obnoxious,as it should be to cool that processor and gpu"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8389,i dunno
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8389,"man, ive tried the gaming laptops from razer, msi, asus....."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8389,the sound of their fans just irritate me.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8389,probably the frequency?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8389,"anyway thats why ive gone with the 16"""
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8389,also la.....
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8389,"i casualyl play LoL , PUBG & Overwatch and its sufficient at 1440p"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8390,Frequency is one thing
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8390,but the design of the blades and chamber are important aspects of fan noise.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8390,Apple has always done wonderful jobs in their fans design.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8391,"Do you guys still experience the ""pop"" sound issue?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8391,Read from other forums the issue still exists.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8392,Yeap it's still there.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8392,Gotten used to it already.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8393,"When gaming with the 16"", I usually put on a laptop stand, just to make sure the air disperses more efficiently."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8393,The fan noise will also be less prominent.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8394,Nearly 8 months and Apple still unable able to solve it.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8395,Hi I have just purchased my new
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8395,16 MacBook Pro
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8395,but right now Im having some dilemma on choosing the right monitor.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8395,Im pretty much a tech idiot
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8395,so I would like to get some help in choosing the right monitor!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8395,Im currently looking at 2 ultrawide monitors from.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8395,prism
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8395,+.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8395,"X300 has a resolution of 2560x1080, 200hz refresh rate and comes with HDMI 2.0 ports along w HDMI 1.4 and Display ports"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8395,"X290 has the same resolution of 2560x1080, 100hz refresh rate and only has HDMI 1.4 and display ports"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8395,"While Im more than happy paying the extra money for the x300, Im just wondering if our 16 MBP GPU can support the specs of monitor 1, or is monitor 1 a bit of an overkill here?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8395,Thank you in advance!!!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8396,The MacBook Pro can connects up to 2 6K 60Hz or 4 4K external monitors through TB3 USB-C.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8396,I would recommend a monitor that comes with a USB C port
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8396,"so you can connect to your MacBook Pro 16""."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8397,Thanks adiboy!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8397,What about the use of an USB-C to HDMI adaptor?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8397,Will that affect the graphics?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8397,Or its just an hassle because I need to buy an extra adaptor?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8398,"ya, u can prob daisy chain e 2 monitors thru 1 TB3 also."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8399,Anyone using the base i9 model?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8399,Any feedback or regrets?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8400,i9 machine here and no regrets!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8400,Beast of a machine and the sound quality from the speaker is second to none in the market.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8401,Working well even when connected to an external monitor?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8402,You can now configure your Macbook Pro 16' to have a AMD Radeon Pro 5600M graphics with 8GB of HBM2 memory
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8403,I never connect mine to external monitor...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8403,"the screen to me is big enough to work on, even for my photo editing."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8403,"I switch my 32"" dell monitor which I used to edit colors for my photos to a 55"" TV because I feel the macbook pro 16 screen is good enough."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,Base i9 user here.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,The only complaint I have is that the fans get very noisy and the surface around the touch bar area gets warm easily.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,This occurs whenever the dedicated graphics are in use.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,"So plugging the 16"" to a monitor will force enable the Radeon card, and drive the fans to around 2800rpm without any background  application running."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,"If you were to run Zoom with external monitor, that would bump the fan speed to 4400rpm."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,This is in contrast to the idle fan speed of 1800rpm.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,"However, this does not mean that the 16"" cannot perform intensive tasks."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,"In fact, the i9 never throttled."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,It just remained warm at 74°C consistently.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,"If you currently own a Dyson fan or hairdryer, the 16"" MacBook Pro fans will sound no different."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,"It's the exact same sound frequency, some like it, others don't."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,The 6-Core i7 will probably be quiter and cooler.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,But I can't confirm this.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,"Besides this, I must say the 16"" retina screen with thin bezels are nice."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,The speakers are undoubtedly the best in the market.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,The tweeters can produce higher highs than my Bose 2.1 speakers.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8404,"And of course, the aluminium body."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8405,"I pair my new 16"" with Dell U2020Q USB-C monitor."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8405,A very great pair..
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8405,I don't hear the noise at all unless I turn on Steam or on long usage with a Chrome browser.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8405,The speaker... is too good.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8405,Sometimes I don't even turn on my Bose speakers.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8406,Very loud leh 16 inch base model....
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8406,But the built in speakers are very good
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8407,does it perform well on final cut pro?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8408,What are you doing at the time when the fans get noisy?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8409,"just hoot 1 from apple online last night, education price + 4.5% cashback from shopback"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8409,"i9 2.3ghz, 32gb ram, 1tb ssd and 5600m 8gb hbm2 ...."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8409,patiently waiting for delivery now...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8410,Wow..
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8410,You hooted the highest end graphics card.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8410,Congrats!
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8411,"Anyone know of any shop I can go to, to help install a screen protector for the MBP 16?"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8412,Dont think the gpu is worth it on mbp
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8413,"Depends.. If you are making money out of your MBP, time is very important."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8414,"Yea, for the work i do, short turnaround time to deliver to clients is impt to me, so just bite the bullet and get it"
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8415,When is yours coming?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8416,Between 7th - 10th jul
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8417,Why not get imac with vega then?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8418,I only using 5300m here.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8418,Performance soso lol.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8418,Need 5500m minimum I think.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8419,What is the use case?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8420,anyone can advise on this?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8420,i input the serial number of my mac
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8420,and it says that 'This device isn’t currently accepted for trade in.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8420,It is still eligible for free recycling.'.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8420,wonder why?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8420,it's only a year old.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8421,For which model?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8421,"Sometimes if too new, they will not accept also."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8422,"2019 13"" Macbook Pro."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8423,Need that 5600m at the very least.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8423,Else don't bother.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8424,Planning to buy a refurbished Mac.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8424,Is 1 TB storage enough for future proofing?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8425,How do you define future proofing?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8425,Continue to get support from Apple?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8426,You can always get external HDDs...
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8426,how much do you need access to immediately that takes up so much space?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8426,"And if you're saying that you're doing 8k video editing, i think your setup needs to be very much different."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8426,"So all that aside, yes it's plenty of space."
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8427,Definitely no plans in doing 8k video editing.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8427,Planning to use it for 4k non-professional editing.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8427,Just thinking if 1TB is enough as a scratch disk or need to have more internal storage.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8428,4K non-professional = 4K from phone those kind of source files?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8428,then yes should be plenty enough for each edit.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8428,Maybe around 200 ~ 300GB per hour of footage.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8428,So yes you will still need to constantly offload to an external HDD once you're done with each project.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8429,I plan to be a professional youtuber like techlead.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8429,What kind of macbook should i get?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8429,Or imac?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8430,Definitely no plans in doing 8k video editing.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8430,Planning to use it for 4k non-professional editing.

mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8431,4K non-professional = 4K from phone those kind of source files?
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8431,then yes should be plenty enough for each edit.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8431,Maybe around 200 ~ 300GB per hour of footage.
mbp 16,Apple,MacBook Pro,8431,So yes you will still need to constantly offload to an external HDD once you're done with each project.

mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8436,Already have a thread on it
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8437,"Hey guys, since all Apple Stores are closed till further notice, anyone knows when the display sets will be out at Challenger or other reseller stores?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8438,That thread like not much traction and the title seems weird =/
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8439,The difference between 2019 and 2020 is just the internals and keyboard.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8439,Based on experience it will take 1-3 months to refresh the stocks.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8440,"i think the keyboard feel is the same as the 16"" mbp"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8440,"u can go challenger or best denki try out , they have 16"" display sets there"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8441,"called apple, they say resellers won't have the display for macbook air 2020 so soon, so i guess we can only use the 16"" mbp as a guage of how the keyboard feels."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8442,The keyboard will be the same as the the 16 MacBook Pro.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8443,Is there a i7 option via the online store?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8443,don't see it.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8444,Yup just select any i3 or i5
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8444,and u can see the processor upgrade
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8445,Rumours has it that new model has an improved keyboard and lower starting price.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8445,I want!
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8446,Not rumours 😂
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8446,its true
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8447,And significantly much faster too than previous generation of MacBook Air.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8447,"For those looking for a compact and lightweight macbook, now is a good time to get the latest MacBook Air."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8448,Should I get ipad Pro or MacBook Air?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8449,Do you see yourself using Apple Pencil?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8449,Writing.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8449,Drawing?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8449,Because that's really the selling point of the iPad Pro
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8450,Get both.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8450,Compliments each other.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8451,iPad Pro is still not a viable replacement to a laptop imo.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8451,Even with a trackpad its still limited by the OS.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8452,Anyway for anyone interested in testing out the demo set was spotted at istudio Paya Lebar Quarter.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8452,This is not an advertisement for them
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8452,I just happened to walk in and saw it
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8453,"Thank you, are there any stocks for sale there?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8454,Thanks everyone for the advice!
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8454,think I will go for MacBook Air as I am not into drawing and writing
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8455,"Anyone have MAC air 2020 version, any good suggest for this unit ?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8455,This unit can get very warm after few hour of usage.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8456,why wud it get warm?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8456,u doing CPU intensive things for a few hours?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8457,Some normal usage can produce alot of heat load and wear off easily.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8458,saw display unit at gain city shops.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8459,normal usage like?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8459,if u're doing intensive CPU stuff like video encoding u're better off with a Macbook Pro.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8459,"Air is meant for everyday tasks like web browsing, documents, media consumption."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8460,Better to upgrade to 16gb ram?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8461,"I ordered a i7 , 16GB ram version on 20 mar 2020."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8461,"Stuck at processing, Still waiting for delivery"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8462,"Call Apple today, shipments for customised versions all delayed till 6th April 2020."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8462,Thats the longest wait ever.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8463,I love the MBA.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8463,Crazy but Im still using my 2012 model.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8463,"Have problems sometimes with the magnetic charging connector, but it still works."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8464,"same, I changed e batt once 2 yrs ago."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8464,otherwise its still chugging along.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8465,My current batt is very weak.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8465,Prob
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8465,an hour if the charging does work.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8465,How much is the batt and also how long does it last now?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8466,I paid $185.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8466,still can last about 5hrs now.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8467,How the performance different between i3 n i5 for this macbook air ?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8468,Benchmark here : https://www.imore.com/early-macbook-air-i7-benchmarks-prove-i5-might-be-one-pick
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8469,it looks like theres some hard limit on e cpu.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8469,which makes sense
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8469,cos else it wud eat into MacBook Pro market share
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8470,"besides the .edu store, any good deals for the basic version?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8471,Edu store still offers a better price.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8471,They never check for online purchases.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8471,Got mine early on Saturday.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8471,The new MacBook Air is really zippy and the battery life is awesome.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8472,When did you order yours?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8472,Mine 1.5 weeks ago still processing
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8473,I ordered on the 20th received it on the 4th
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8474,"I ordered mine on 28/03, with an estimated delivery date of 09/04 to 17/04."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8474,Current status is still under processing.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8475,Thanks for info

mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8475,Should be shipping anytime this week
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8476,Which configuration did you get?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8476,Is it hot when using?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8477,I love the 2012 version too..
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8477,unfortunately the logic board spoilt and repair cost around $800+.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8478,Anyone knows if delivery times for MBA is accurate?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8478,Thinking of ordering one
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8478,but it says delivery date 22/4 - 29/4.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8478,Are there times where the delivery is earlier than stated timing?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8479,Largely accurate.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8479,"However, due to the global situation affecting even logistics and shipments, give and take is necessary, expect it to arrive on the last few days or even exceeding quoted dates."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8480,i5 8GB 256GB MBA 2020
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8480,Order Placed:27 March 2020
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8480,Arrives 07/04/2020 - 16/04/2020.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8480,Preparing to ship
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8481,"Thinking of buying this to bootcamp, is it a good idea?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8482,Probably not.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8482,The fan in MBA seems to spin up relatively easily for moderate tasks
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8483,from reviews it seems cpu constantly at 100deg for e slightest tasks.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8483,fan also full blast
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8483,but doesnt cool down cpu
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8483,cos not connected to heat sink
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8484,a lot of reviews advice not to buy 2020 mba cos' of the heatsink issue.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8485,Then the fan is doing what?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8485,Just for shown?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8486,air circulation
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8487,Hopefully got people mod the heatsink with the fan.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8488,Static pressure fan.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8488,Not as effective as airflow fans
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8489,"Whatever are the comments about it, I have placed an order..."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8489,it should arrive between 17 and 24 Apr 2020~~
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8489,Can't wait~~
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8489,i5 quad core
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8489,"256gb
8"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8489,"g
education price~~"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8490,"For those who are worried about the heatsink, take a look at the video below."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8491,hmm seems pretty ok here 🤔
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8492,"The i5 actually has worse battery life, hotter and louder compared to the 2019 version."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8492,Yes it's faster
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8492,"but if you want better battery life and don't do any intensive tasks, suggest to go for the i3 version which is good enough for basic tasks."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8493,The new 2020 MacBook Air still shares the same internal layout as the previous version.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8493,The fan is not positioned at the heat sink.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8493,So there's a high chance the CPU will thermal throttle itself
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8493,low performance or fried itself due to overheating.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8494,I was worried about this but not anymore after reading many comments and reviews.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8494,"The heat only become an issue if you are doing intensive tasks, such as video rendering, streaming, photoshop, etc etc at the same time."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8494,"If you think u are going to be doing these, I suggest you get the Macbook Pro."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8494,The Air is not for these purposes.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8494,"It can handle the most basic computer tasks with ease emails, youtube, webbrowsing, microsoft office."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8494,Yah chill.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8495,"That is if you are doing intensive tasks, most people buying a macbook air won't be doing any of those and it will be absolutely fine for normal everyday use."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8496,"Totally agree, if you dig deeper into some review."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8496,The temperature you're feeling is just around 40
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8496,+
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8496,degree which is the common temperature you will be feeling in the keypad in almost all laptop of this factor.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8497,True.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8497,"But as years go by, with every OS updates, every program updates, more process intensive web browsing, more memory needed to stream HD youtube/netflix etc, the 2020 macbook air will heat up very quickly say in 2023."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8497,Just like how my 2012 MBP is already heating up to high 70/80 degree activated high fan speed macs fan control surfing on youtube/netflix with Chrome browser.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8497,"Although the specs are good for this new MBA, the performance are impeded by this flawed layout."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8497,"Hence I'll wait for the new 13/14"" MBP which rumour said is coming end of this month."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8498,Really?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8498,End of this month?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8499,Take it with pitch of salt.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8500,Received mine mid noon.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8500,Pretty great machine
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8500,"so far post-setup, yet to start work on it to judge its suitability."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8500,Also eyeing the upcoming 13.3/14 pro model
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8501,Oh!
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8501,What was your delivery window?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8501,Still waiting on mine.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8501,16th-23rd for me
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8502,"On mobile, not convenient to multi quote."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8502,Details are on past few pages
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8503,Which model u guys getting?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8504,"Ordered the i5, 16gb, 512gb model."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8504,"I just sold off my 2015, 15 mbp."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8504,"I no longer do video work, only light photo editing and adobe indesign work."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8504,"The 2015, 15 inch is the best laptop I’ve ever owned."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8504,It’s a workhorse and has never let me down.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8504,"But everytime i’d walk by an Apple store, I’d try the 13 inch models and the size is really attractive."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8504,Was thinking of upgrading last year
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8504,but the butterfly keyboards really made me consider.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8504,"No matter how many times I try it, it felt in every way inferior to the older keyboards Apple used to make."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8504,"I know this MacBook Air has some thermal issues, however with my workflow"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8504,", I don’t think it will be that big of a deal."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8504,"Once the laptop comes in, I’ll use it for a week or so."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8504,If it’s doesn’t run well
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8504,", I’ll return it and wait for the 2020 13inch mbp."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8505,Ive spent some time with it.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8505,"During setup and installation phase, it went as high as sub 80 Celsius."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8505,"My normal usage include simultaneously running a tab of script-active chrome, safari browsing, and several messaging apps."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8505,Typical observed temps hover around 60 to 70 tops.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8505,Netflix on safari went up to similar temps too.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8505,I believe this is an acceptable range for what this device is designed for.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8505,I believe you would do fine
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8505,Keyboard wise
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8505,this felt like a blend of scissors and butterfly switch.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8505,I still have my mid 2016 MBP to compare.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8505,"If anything, the keys on MBA has less wobble and feels somewhat butterfly-like."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8505,Even went to double check if it really is scissors mechanism
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8505,lol
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8506,I also want to upgrade to i5 cos of the quad core but is 16gb ram really needed?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8506,Cos
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8506,"I come from a window 10 user, so"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8506,not sure how powerful iOS ram is.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8506,For me base ssd 256gb should be enough as always can do external drive.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8506,"Wow ur spec should be near $2k range, can buy mbp anytime."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8507,Btw do you guys purchase the $308 AppleCare+?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8507,"If yes, why?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8507,"If no, why?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8508,I ordered the same configuration as yours.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8508,"Ordered on 28 Mar, expected delivery 09"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8508,- 17 Apr. Item shipped from China on 14 Apr.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8508,"As of now, no new updates."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8508,May I check how long the item will typically be delivered after the item has shipped?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8509,peace of mind if u want to use it for > 1 yr
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8510,Mine just left the facility in China yesterday.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8510,Ordered on April 3rd.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8510,Expected delivery date 16th-23rd
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8511,Intel is still making 14nm chips for their latest 10th gen series.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8511,"We need 7nm to bring temps down on these newer ultrathin machines, especially when a number of these are 4/6/8 cores these days..."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8511,"I own a 16"" Macbook Pro"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8511,and it looks like the same thermal issues are happening on the 2020 MacBook Air.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8512,"If DHL Express, 3 days for me"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8513,"So I guess the upcoming 13/14"" will have the same issue."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8514,"When that day comes, its going to be Apple ARM chipset."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8514,Intel doom day is near for ultra thin laptop.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8515,Just had a chat with DHL Express - the parcel is still sitting inside a container in Chengdu after despatching from Apple's warehouse on 14 Apr.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8515,"The parcel will be despatch to HK tonight 17 Apr for consolidation, before delivery to SG."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8515,Likely will be able to receive it only early next week.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8515,That will be way beyond the expected delivery date of 09 - 17 Apr.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8516,Mine just says departed from the facility.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8516,16th April.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8516,Apple site says expected to arrive by 23rd.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8516,by original dates were 16 - 24th
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8517,Whos excited for the macbook pro 2020?!
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8518,Argh my mbp 2015 died.........
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8518,how how
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8519,Not if they keep sticking to intel
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8520,isnt the new 16 inch mbp known for its good thermal performance?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8520,Sent from Google PIXEL 2 XL using GAGT
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8521,Mine arrived in singapore just now morning.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8521,Now its sitting in the dhl delivery facility since 11.30am.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8521,I think they can only send it to me on monday.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8521,But apples site is saying it will arrive wednesday.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8522,Looks like they revert back to the old 2014/5 type scissors keyboard.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8522,"My current macbook 12""'s keyboard is the butterfly type.."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8522,Such a pain to use..
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8523,Any idea how the 14 days return works during C.B Period?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8523,My mbp 2015 died and i looking to get a replacement.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8523,But not sure if i will like the MacBook Air.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8524,do you mind explaining the return process?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8524,same question as previous post
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8524,how does the 14d return policy work during this period?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8525,I think ill just contact apple support and see what they advise me from there.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8525,If too much of a hassle maybe I can just sell it off.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8526,Just get it repaired by 3rd party repairman.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8526,$300 should be your base price.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8527,Repair twice already lol.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8527,$500+
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8527,total.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8527,"Repair already, one year later .. spoil"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8528,Getting my macbook air tomorrow.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8528,I really hope this new generation of apple macbooks are gonna be good.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8528,the butterfly generation was such a low point for the mac.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8528,"Nothin from the 2016 - 2019 mbp line made me want to replace my 4 year old 2015 15inch macbook pro, with the exception of the 16inch mbp."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8528,Hopefully the thermal issues arent too bad.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8529,So far i've been using my mac for the past 3 weeks.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8529,"I always have Whatsapp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Visual Code Studio running."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8529,"I have Safari with 3-5 tabs, chrome with 4- 12 tabs."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8529,with video streaming on one of the tab.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8529,I also run Adobe Illustrator / Adobe Photoshop concurrently.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8529,"So far the heat doesnt feel like a problem to me, it runs really well and able to handle all the tasks i'm using."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8529,Only really throttles when i have Netflix on running video at 1080p.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8529,while all my background tasks are still running.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8529,"im using the i7 , 16gb, 512 ssd version."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8530,If you aren't use it for photo editing would be fine because the display it wasn't 100 % sRGB.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8531,i do very casual photo editing.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8531,"and coming from my 2015, 15inch, I dont think that model had 100% srgb too, so it shouldnt be that big of a deal."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8531,EDIT:
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8531,Both devices also feature True Tone display which adjusts the color temperature of your display to the environment you're in to give you a much better viewing experience.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8531,"The MacBook Pro's display features P3 wide color gamut, versus the Air's sRGB so colors and contrast ratio is much better on the Pro."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8531,Lifted from a review on Appleinsider.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8531,I think the 2016 models onwards got the P3 wide colour gamut screens.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8531,2015 and
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8531,below retinas used the regular sRGB screens.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8531,similar to the 2020 macbook air
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8532,Mine is on the same shipment as yours.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8532,"And I managed to get my set yesterday, on the same day it arrives in SG."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8533,You just have to pack your MacBook Air back to its original packaging and wait for DHL to come up and pick it from you.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8534,First impressions after 8 hours of use.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8534,I restored an original time machine from my old macbook pro.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8534,"Took awhile and after the restore was done, the macbook air was unusable due to the indexing that was being done."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8534,After an hour or two the mac finally settled down and is quite snappy to use.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8534,"HOWEVER, the fans do kick up quite abit."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8534,One thing that i do use is screen sharing on discord and this macbook air can handle screen sharing
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8534,but the cpu is always at 100 degrees and the fans are at full blast when screen sharing.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8534,Quite a deal breaker honestly.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8534,I'll keep using it for now.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8534,Maybe its still indexing in the background and stuff.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8534,But so far the fans do kick in quite alot.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8534,"Tested with the i5, 16gb ram and 512gb ssd model"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8535,Status of With delivery courier dated today at 10.28am means it will be delivered to my home today?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8536,when e CPU is at 100 deg
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8536,what's e distribution of e cores usage at?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8536,100%?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8537,"Yes, thermal performance have been improved on the 16"" but Apple increased the fan speeds, heat pipe diameter and air vent holes to compensate Intel's ""hotter"" 14nm CPUs."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8537,"This is more or less a ""damage control"" approach, and the drawback will be inevitably louder fan noises."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8537,It appears that 2020 MacBook Air users experience louder fan noises too.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8537,Apple has done their part.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8537,"It's now Intel's turn to do the right thing, and that is to introduce 7nm chips."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8538,"Okay, quick update."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8538,"This afternoon I received the MBA 2020, i5, 256gd SSD, 8gb memory."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8538,Opened Safari with 3 tabs.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8538,one for trading account.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8538,one for whatsapp.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8538,one for youtube / netflix
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8538,The top middle part of the keyboard gets too hot for my liking.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8538,"When I plugged in the power cable, I get static feel too."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8538,I expect more from Apple's product.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8538,I have arranged return and refund 15min ago.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8538,Yup.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8538,All on the same day.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8538,I am going to get the Dell XPS
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8538,13 2020 instead.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8538,Mac OS was my preferred choice
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8538,but it was not meant to be.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8539,"yeah,"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8539,"im feeling the same way, coming from a 2015 mbp."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8539,This 2020 air feels really lackluster.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8539,"I had 8 tabs open in safari, the mac photos app and discord open."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8539,the photos app was chugging while scrolling through and once in awhile my mac would slow to a crawl and
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8539,the force touch trackpad wouldnt click for 10 seconds or so as i see the spinning beachball.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8539,Really sucks
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8540,"For new macbook or new OS installed or new SSD fixed, it's normal for it to run hot as the processor is indexing."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8540,It will be normal after a day or 2 especially if you have large data transferred from the previous mac.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8541,For solved static feel could use power adapter extension cable.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8542,Yeah I hope thats the case.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8542,I transferred 300gb from an old time machine.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8542,The indexing appears to have finished yesterday.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8542,But Ill give it a day or two more.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8542,Another thing that I use is discord screen share.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8542,Just sharing some docs or presentations.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8542,And the laptop all 4 cores shoot up to 100 degrees within the first minute and the fan is just blaring non stop.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8542,Its really really annoying.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8542,This is also with just safari and 5 tabs open.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8542,Ive not even opened my docs or power point
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8542,apps lol.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8542,And it will often just crash and beachball for 3-5 minutes while the screen sharing is going on.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8542,And I will need to hard restart it.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8542,I will upload a video soon showing the choppiness of this laptop after a fresh restart
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8543,Are u saying i should let it run for 2 more days?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8543,What is indexing?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8544,indexing is when it needs to read and organize all the files on the computer.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8544,Normally it takes a day or two after a backup/restore.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8544,"If you hit command+space, it will show indexing under the search bar as you type something."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8544,That is just the files.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8544,"But the backend, normally it wont show."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8545,But i got no files to transfer/backup/restore.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8545,It is a clean slate.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8545,So I am surprised it runs hot just by opening some basic apps.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8546,yeah to be brutally honest
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8546,", i really hate this laptop now."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8546,It sits at like 70 - 100 degrees constantly while doing menial tasks.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8546,I know this is not a pro machine.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8546,"But come on, 5 tabs open safari, not chrome and the mac photos app and spotify and discord and its at 85 degrees celsius and sometimes hitting 100."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8546,I cant even use discord sreenshare comfortably because the fan is just blarring doing its best to cool the cpu.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8546,"Plus while the fan is at max speed, the screenshare is not even smooth."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8546,The mac gets all choppy and is just borderline useable.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8546,"Coming from the 2015, 15inch, maybe i was just spoiled by that model That was the best laptop ive owned and moving from that to this, the macos experience is so much worse."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8547,Are you going to refund it?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8547,"For me, yes."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8547,Mentioned earlier too.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8547,Already packed it inside the boxes.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8547,Waiting to be shipped back on 23 Apr.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8548,Ill wait till the 12 or 13th day.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8548,I really need a laptop right now.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8548,I am for sure returning it.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8548,I really love macos but the options from apple right now are either casual use or pro use.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8548,Nothing in the middle.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8548,Hopefully when i return this the macbook pro
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8548,13inch is not too far away.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8549,"after seeing your post, i feel like cancelling the order."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8549,but it just changed status to preparing to ship.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8549,lol.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8549,guess i have to receive it and then return it.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8549,rumours saying mbp releasing next month
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8550,"This laptop has so much going for it, but the cooling really is a big let down."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8550,The fan is just obnoxious.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8550,"Before i thought, aiya can la."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8550,"Shouldnt be too bad, but the fan noise after awhile is just really annoying"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8550,", think about it, 8,000rpm constantly."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8550,In general this laptop is just.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8550,fine
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8550,but nothing more.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8550,"For the average user, just browsing, it would still be hard for me to recommend this laptop."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8550,"Maybe get the i3 model, cause the i3 model is cooler."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8550,This laptop really fell short during screen sharing applications.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8550,Unfortunately i need it for sharing presentations and docs and it cant even comfortably do that.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8550,Its really meant for the very very basic user.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8550,Here are some screenshots of my thermals
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8551,Thank you for the feedback.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8551,Looks like my temptation died down much.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8552,its not worth the wait.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8552,I waited 3 weeks plus for this.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8552,Totally not worth it.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8552,"Also, this is just my anecdote."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8552,I may have gotten a faulty model.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8552,But the thermal issues reported seem to be in line with my experience
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8553,I am giving the MBA 2020 another chance to convince me...
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8554,"Well, I have managed to resolve the static issue by using an extension cable from my old MBP."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8554,"Heat wise, I am 50-50."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8555,thanks all for sharing informal reviews.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8555,"im surprised the thermals are like this for a new mb air product given its always supposed to be slim and cool running, furthermore with new ice lake processors."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8555,had considered this among several laptops and ended up buying a LG gram 17z90n
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8556,It is probably not designed for a quad core processor i5/i7.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8557,They probably should have stick to not making the processor configurable i.e keeping it to standard i3 for all MacBook Air.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8558,Does that mean i3 can run this cooler?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8558,"Im thinking to get the very basic one for simple web surfing, extract documents from OneDrive, and chat in iMessage."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8559,The i3 will run cooler.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8559,I dont
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8559,know if I can wholeheartedly recommend it.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8559,For your use case of apps that you just listed.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8559,The i3 is probably fine.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8559,"But the i5 is what Id pickjust for future proofing, so that it can last and feel snappy after 2-3 years, just based off those apps."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8560,Only for intensive tasks that last a very short while.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8560,Else it thermal throttle and it will be no different from i3.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8561,from video reviews it doesnt throttle.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8561,just runs at e base clock cos temps too high.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8562,correct.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8562,it doesnt throttle.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8562,"It runs at base clock minimum, but its always pushing the temperatures."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8562,"So its just a little strange when youre browsing on safari with just 5 tabs, spotify, docs,etc and the laptop sounds"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8562,like its gonna take off.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8563,"Hi, I am selling it for S$1200.00 Non-Neg."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8563,Still in Good Condition.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8563,Under Warranty Till Sept 2021.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8563,Bank Transfer only to POSB
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8563,eSavings Account 421-15617-4.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8563,PM
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8563,Me if you are interested.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8563,Google for Spec if you are interested to know.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8563,It is Macbook Air Year 2017 Edition.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8564,"Yeah after one day of using, I think I will continue to use it for the foreseeable future."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8564,Because the heat is bearable after all.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8564,And I do want to try out Mac OS again after using windows for about 2 years.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8564,Time for a change.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8564,Not helped by the extension of CB and the fact that XPS 13 2020 also has heat issues.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8564,These two laptops are the only models I am looking at.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8565,Seems like all the new laptops will have heat issues somehow or another.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8566,How the temp if you open few tabs in safari ?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8566,You could check with this.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8567,It was alright.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8567,"So far in all my time of use, I have not manage to hear any fan noise."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8567,"I guess my tasks are not intensive enough, which is good news."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8568,Usually you would hear fan noise if it reach above 80 C.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8569,"Is Facebooking, YouTubing and spotifying consider heavy?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8569,Chroming with 10 tabs
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8569,running consider heavy?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8569,Will hit 80 degree?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8570,"it hit 80 easily for me with safari on 7-10 tabs, Spotify, Mac photos app and discord and email app open"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8571,is it just me or forum got some problem ?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8571,"i couldn't find the mbp 16"" thread"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8572,looks like kena purged liao.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8572,there's only 1 page on e  Clinic main page
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8572,n
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8572,it's not there
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8573,The good thing about using Apple product is that the thermal issue might get fixed by Apple through firmware updates if there are bugs causing it.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8573,"For windows manufacturer, its not so often youll see them fixing the thermal issues through firmware updates."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8574,weird ah i tot only me cannot see the thread.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8574,i tot
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8574,usually only EOL product then will remove thread ?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8574,"but this is mbp 16"" still so new ?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8575,yeah
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8575,i hv accepted the mba.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8575,Called Apple to cancel the return yesterday.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8575,It is okay after all.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8576,This MBA 2020 is not worth buying at all.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8576,Just running chrome alone will cause the processor heat up to 100c.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8576,I think topping up 300 dollars for a Macbook pro is better.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8576,Hope the 2020 MBP model gets released in may.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8577,I thought of waiting for the MBP too but decided against.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8577,"Thats because:
a cheap low end laptop with mac os"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8577,light weight laptop
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8577,i do not use cpu intensive apps
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8577,"I have whatsapp, facebook, twitter, trading account, google news, edmw and etc on on Safari"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8577,and I have yet to hear any fan noise.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8577,The heat is mainly at the metal part above F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 buttons.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8577,Which I think is present at all mac laptops.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8578,"Errr ok but keep in mind if it runs at 100c constantly, the laptop isn't gonna last for long."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8579,"This YouTube shows it does not run at 100c all the time, even with 4k60 YouTube."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8580,nope....
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8580,it does not run 100c constantly...
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8581,Thats because you are using chrome 😂
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8581,Nobody uses chrome on macOS.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8581,Its one of the worse apps ever to be on macOS.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8582,Do I have a choice?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8582,Since Safari 13 all the ad-blockers are down.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8582,The remaining ones suck at blocking ads.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8582,Firefox's zoom sucks on MacOS.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8582,The alternative left is basically Chrome.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8582,But the point is this
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8582,", you replace chrome with iMovie, spotify, it's still going to run at close to 100c and spoil quicker."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8582,Simply because the fan isn't connected to the heatsink which is ridiculous.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8582,Even the 2015 air's heatsink is connected.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8583,"You have alternative, which is to use Edge Chromium."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8583,Same as chrome but much better security.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8583,And MacBook Air is not the only laptop to have thermal issue with this chip.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8583,The inherent issues come with Intel who has poorly designed a poor chip.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8583,"Anyhow, you might want to return your unit and get another one to make sure you didnt get a lemon."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8584,what do u mean adblockers r down?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8585,u prob did not finish reading e article?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8585, just changed e backend.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8585,I'm still using AdGuard for Safari n
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8585,it's working.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8586,That's false.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8586,I have been using Safari for 5 years with AdBlocker on.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8586,It still runs flawlessly today with the latest version.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8586,Safari is overall a more fluid experience than Chrome.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8586,I only use Chrome if I want to stream 4K or 8K Videos on YouTube; features that aren't available on Safari.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8587,How long usually take from Processing to Preparing to ship?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8588,Same here.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8588,I have adbplus running in safari.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8588,And safari uses less power than chrome.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8588,I also use Chrome only when need 4k YouTube.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8588,Too bad no 4k Netflix.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,yup.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,i use safari 90% of the time.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,i use wipr as my adblocker.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,"anyways to anyone looking to pick this macbook air up, if your use case is only basic stuff."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,"a few tabs, music/spotify, email."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,This laptop is fine.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,The temps are just too high for my liking for menial tasks and the fan is just annoying.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,"For a company that usually loves to market their products as silent and thin and light, them not including a heatpipe to prevent the fans from spinning up too much"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,is just weird.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,"I understand the design of the fan, as it is acting more as a case fan than a direct CPU fan, however just adding a heatpipe would have cooled the CPU so much better and allowed it to stretch its legs more."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,The laptop stutters alot for me too.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,"Sometimes i wake the laptop up in the morning, my apps are stuttering."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,I dont know if this is a catalina issue or a macbook air issue.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,"But my 2015, 15inch macbook pro didnt have this issue."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,"In my 6 days of using this laptop, its given me more issues than my 2015"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,", 15inch has in 4 years."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,I would really recommend waiting for the 13inch macbook pro refresh.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,"Even if its just a keyboard refresh and nothing more, I would still recommend you to wait haha."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,Its rumored to be in may.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,The prices will stay the same probably
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,but the storage will be doubled.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,So you could probably get a 256gb/8gb mbp13 for maybe S$2199.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,"As off right now, on the apple singapore store, the 2thunderbolt 3 model with 128gbssd and 8gb ram is $1899, 256gb ssd model is $2199."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,Im gonna guess that they will be making the macbook pro 13
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,all come standard with 4 thunderbolt 3 ports to differentiate it from the macbook air.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,So my guess would be a new 13inch model with 256gb ssd and 8gb ram for 2199.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,or at most $2299.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,That gives it a wide enough gap in terms of price vs the $1449 MBA 2020 and far enough from the base $3499
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,16inch mbp.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,As for me I will be aiming for a 512gb and 16gb model.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,Hopefully that will be priced at $2599 or $2699
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,"Also keep in mind, if you watch alot of youtubers doing all these benchmakrs and testing of temperatures."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,Please remember that their ambient temperatures is very different from ours.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,We are always in humid 29 - 33 degree weather.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,Thats why their temperatures are almost never consistent.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,Got one youtuber say 90
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,", one say 100, one say 75."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,Its so varied that i feel like they're not talking about the same laptop even.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8589,They all fail to point that ambient temperature plays a part too.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8590,hey guys i have received my quadcore i5 256gb mba 2020 today.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8590,"while upgrading the os to its latest version, i do feel the top part of the keyboard area about f4 to f8 getting hot for a while"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8590,but it didn't last long.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8590,playing youtube videos and surfing 3 tabs so far .. temperature feels fine.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8590,havent hear any fan noise yet
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8590,i am going to test this with more heavy browsing to see how it goes before deciding to get a refund or not.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8590,not thinking of moving my stuff over from my 2011 mbp as i prefer a clean state.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8591,Yeah its good to have more real local reviews rather than those foreign youtuber s.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8591,The MacBook Pro might be coming out in May
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8591,but the price highly be in the high side of the thousand
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8591,at least so might not be everyone budget.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8591,"Can see that most of the guys here are getting the i5, how about the ram?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8591,8gb or 16gb?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8592,The hardware is the same here or overseas.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8592,The difference is in the weather and usage pattern.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8593,Depending on your usage.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8593,"8GB RAM is enough if you are a light user, mainly using it for surfing, video streaming, emails and word/data processing."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8593,"Youll only need 16GB RAM if you open a lot of tabs, big excel files and a little bit of photo/ videos editing."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8594,"the more i think about it, the more the 16gb ram does not make sense to me."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8594,"In a laptop where the cpu is easily pushed, I dont think 16gb ram will ever be needed"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8594,as the cpu is more likely gonna bottleneck your workflow before you can even reach 16gb ram usage.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8594,Because the most tabs i had open was 18 and the laptop was quite choppy already.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8594,"18 tabs safari, discord, spotify."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8594,I would recommend 8gb ram and i3/i5.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8594,Probably i3 as it runs cooler.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8594,"If you get the i3 model with 8gb ram and 256gb ssd its only 1,449."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8594,For a macbook air in 2020 that is a pretty good deal.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8594,Also to add on to my post earlier.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8594,The battery is actually not that great compared to the old macbook airs of past.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8594,"In my testing, i think 6 - 8 hours at 50% brightness."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8594,"After researching abit, the older macbook airs had 6,800mah batteries while this one only has 4,400."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8594,Quite the drop in capacity even if the processors are more power efficient.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8595,"Hi guys,"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8595,"Thinking of getting the base model i3, 8gb ram, 256gb ssd."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8595,"Usage will mostly be low end productivity excel, word, casual surfing with a few tabs open, plus youtube & netflix when I stream stuff, I don't usually open a lot of tabs."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8595,"I don't do any photo/video-editing, or any type of CPU intensive stuff."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8595,"Have a dedicated laptop for gaming and more intensive stuff, so this MBA is really for portability and also trying out MacOS for the first time."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8595,Read/watched videos about the high temps and got a little concerned.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8595,Will I be alright with my stated use-case?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8595,Thanks!
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8596,Your case will be alright.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8596,You dont even need that extra 128GB.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8597,cpu not fully utilized
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8597,doesnt mean ram wont be used.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8597,e more
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8597,apps/
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8597,tabs
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8597,u have opened e more ram it will use.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8597,more ram is always better than less ram
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8598,Copied from somewhere;.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8598,"RAM is the size of the desk, but the processor is the person sitting at the desk."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8599,anyone can advice what app is this?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8599,thanks.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8600,Thanks!
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8601,Got a MBA 2020 i5 8GB 512GB for my secondary school kid.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8601,"She uses Microsoft office, zoom meetings, Skype, web browsing and watching youtube and anime."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8601,No fan or heating issues.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8601,Everything felt snappy.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8601,I read the reviews and was a bit worried but ended up with no problems at all.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8602,I would have traded that 512GB for additional 8GB if RAM.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8602,I believe she needs more RAM than storage capacity.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8603,8GB is more than enough for normal tasks.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8603,I have 8GB on my Mac mini 2018 and Im
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8603,doing  the occasional video editing with it.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8603,"My 2011 mba with 4gb ram is also still working well, though a bit slow nowadays."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8603,Haha.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8604,i got this static issue.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8604,do you mean you use your old mbp charging cable?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8604,any suggestion for those who don't have thunderbolt 3 cable
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8605,"I am using this:
Use the above to connect to your 30W USB-C Power Adapter."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8605,Viola~~
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8606,Looking for laptop to replace my 2011 mba.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8606,Saw mixed reviews.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8606,"Basically I m using laptop purely for web browsing , word processor , YouTube."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8606,Will 8gig ram n 265gig disk be sufficient?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8606,I m still undecided whether to get the current mba due to heating issue.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8606,Any advise?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8607,Your usage will be fine with the config.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8607,Just go ahead.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8608,"Thanks bro, just saw the delivery date in May"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8609,try lazada that has discounts for apple products right now.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8609,"however, they sell only the standard models."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8610,didn't notice the heat issues
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8610,but my Mac does throttle bit when I overload it with my adobe cc stuff running.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8610,"I do have video streams on and a lot of background apps running, but I will consider upgrading to the new MacBook Pro if my usage increases."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8611,My MacBook Air 2017 has excellent sturdy keyboard.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8611,"Better than the latest version of all MacBook Air from 2018 onwards... if you intend to use keyboard for a long time, consider mine..."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8611,"this is not a sales method to sell my MacBook Air 2017, check review online regarding MacBook Air 2017 keyboard and it will tell you it is a durable keyboard."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8611,PM
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8611,me if you are interested to buy...
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8612,this is not a sales thread dude
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8613,Apple is using the new scissors keyboard in the mba 2020 which should fix all the 2018/2019 keyboard issues.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8614,"Anyone here using MacBook Air 2020 for programming purposes like Xcode, Android Studio or Unity?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8615,Yeah I didn't do that
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8615,and you are probably right as data storage all on cloud.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8615,I was lazy and picked the predefined config and didn't try to customise.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8615,Oh well never mind.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8615,Still good.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8616,Is it worth getting the Air 2020 for light RAW photo editing and abit of graphic design.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8616,"Thinking of speccing it out with i5,16GB RAM and 512GB SSD."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8616,I just sold off my 15 inch 2016 version due to weight and prefer to downgrade to 13 inches screen.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8617,it is not even close to 100% P3 gamut.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8617,will this affect ur editing?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8618,Not really as I'm not doing it professionally.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8619,Or wait for the new 13 Pro in May?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8620,Reporting in.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8620,What answer are you seeking?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8621,Depending on the news I am considering of returning the MacBook Air for the Pro.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8621,Overall the day to day usage for me has been relatively good.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8621,Battery life can last me from 8am to 10pm 1130 - 2pm no usage before needing to charge again.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8622,That's another option
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8622,but I'm assuming it'll cost around 3K when I specced it the way I want
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8623,Hmm... I would say you just need to upgrade the RAM to 16GB and stick with 256GB of storage.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8623,The processor for the new base model MBP13 is definitely better than the one in MBA13.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8624,Hows the performance when doing development in particular running Android emulator which is always slow.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8625,I think u should go for the Pro.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8626,I agree with plsbanthem instead of a 13 u should get the 16.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8626,Running the emulator eats up a lot of processor power and gets really hot on my MBA hovering around temp of 80~90 degrees.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8626,I usually run the emulator on my desktop instead as I feel if I continue running it might just fry the circuit board in the long run.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8627,"Will you be getting the 16"" after returning this MBA 2020?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8627,"I read that the 16"" also has thermal issue."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8628,I think the current build for all the new MacBooks will have thermal issues.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8628,"Not sure if it was deliberate or not,"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8628,but I would wait a little longer to see if the new pros that is rumoured to be out this mod this month.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8628,Will wait for it to be stripped down before deciding as my MBA 2020 is max specced.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8628,I probably wont feel much of a difference if it was the new pro.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8628,Unless they introduce a dedicated graphics for it.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8629,"Dedicated graphic will only be on the 16""..."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8630,Dedicated graphics will have its own issue due to the automatic switching.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8631,Ordered the 2020 almost 2 wks ago.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8631,Still processing.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8631,"With the China golden week now, dunno when will deliver."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8631,Haha.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8632,ah... mine took 20 days to arrive from when I ordered.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8632,It does take awhile to deliver.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8632,Just checked the apple site
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8632,and wow it is still at 2 weeks+ estimates
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8633,I meant for an equal sized macbook.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8633,Wont be lugging around a 16 just for coding.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8633,If I need media editing capabilities I rather use a desktop for it compiles much faster.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8634,Thats so weird.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8634,I ordered my base spec mba 2020 on 26 apr.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8634,Delivered in 2 days.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8634,Shipment was was already in singapore according to order tracking
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8635,mine is customized.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8635,i changed the i3 to i5.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8636,New MacBook Pro 13 announced!
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8637,My i5 MBA's temperatures have consistently stay in 50 degree cel.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8637,"Can go as low at 37 if not doing anything, as high as 55 when i running some simple apps."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8638,New MacBook Pro announced but not much of an upgrade for me.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8638,I will just stick to my MBA instead.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8638,"Im already using an i7 , 16gb RAM, 512gb SSD."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8638,The only difference is the screen display.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8639,So you will be keeping it to do development?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8640,not only that.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8640,"for processing intensive tasks, MBP will have a greater advantage."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8640,"MBP also has better speakers, touch bar."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8640,price gap between MBA and MBP is not significant.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8641,Anyone knows what's the maximum WiFi speed?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8641,Is it 866 Mbps?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8642,I believe for MacBook Air
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8642,the antenna should be 3x3 MIMO
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8642,so maximum speed on AC should be 1300Mbps
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8642,but you wont achieve this speed anyway.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8643,The processor used is different.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8643,MBA is using the Y series while 13
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8643,Pro is using the U series.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8643,MBP gives you more processing power and also faster RAM.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8643,Oh did I mention better thermal design?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8643,Yeah
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8643,so all will result in faster and more stable performance.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8644,"oh, isn't the ram same speed 3733mhz for both?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8644,and also mbp has fan to the cpu heatsink.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8644,I think apple purposely leave this out on the MBA so that it is not even close to competing with the pros.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8645,Yes my bad.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8645,I was comparing between the base model.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8645,"But between both 10th Gen models of MBA and MBP, the RAM speed is the same."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8646,I tried zoom with my macbook air today..
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8646,OMFG..
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8646,the Camera is absolutely Rubbish..
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8646,its so grainy.. its like 10 years ago technology.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8647,The camera is still 720p.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8648,both MBA 2020 and MBP 2020 are still using 720p camera.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8648,No comparison there.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8648,10th
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8648,Gen MBA vs 10th Gen MBP.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8648,RAM : No difference.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8648,PROCESSOR :
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8648,MBA -Y processor vs MBP -U processor - probably.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8648,SSD:
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8648,No difference
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8648,GPU :
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8648,Both Intel Iris Plus
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8648,The only difference is when there is a real teardown to see how the internals are built for MBP.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8648,And definitely a Y processor cannot compare to a U processor.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8648,MBA2020 definitely has heat issues because of the Fan placement wonder why did Apple hire such subpar engineers that designed the placement.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8648,Oh was the design engineer on drugs?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8649,"Based on the above same spec, the price different is how much?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8650,"Plan to get the i5, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD..."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8650,Think can only get from Apple Online Store...
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8650,Does Apple Online Store have promotions?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8651,education discount
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8651,or if your company have EPP/CIS with apple.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8651,Posted with iPhone 11 Pro Max HardwareZone Forums app
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8652,Not necessarily.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8652,"If you are getting the 10th Gen CPU, the specs you wanted is the base model."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8652,It will be available from authorized reseller too.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8653,Tot standard configuration is with 8GB RAM only I go check again
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8654,8GB base model is for the 8th Gen processor.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8655,"Err Here is topic for MBA 2020, where got 8th Gen processor?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8655,😝
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8656,Haha sorry bro my bad.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8656,I thought this thread is about MBP13
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8657,$2429 for MBA i7.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8657,$2699 for MBP i5.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8657,$2999 for MBP i7
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8658,Anyone here still planning to get MacBook Air as opposed to MacBook Pro?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8659,really torn between getting a MacBook Air base model i3 or a MacBook Pro base model.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8659,"Just worried about the thermals in mba but also dont really like the fact that mbp base model is still i8, any kind souls would like to advise?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8659,"Its just for some emails, words documents , socials and Netflix usage"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8660,I hv the MBA 2020 and can vouch for its capacity to perform your listed activities without issue.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8660,Price wise is much lower than MBP too.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8660,And most impt for me is lightest weight amongst the current lineup.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8661,Been using MBA i3 2020 for more than a week and have not experienced any thermal issue and lagging.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8661,"Mainly using it for streaming youtube, whatsapping web version, microsoft office, emailing, surfing websites etc."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8661,The i3 model is the most bang for buck Macbook
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8661,i ever bought since 2017!
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8661,"The same improved magic keyboard and speaker, newer RAM and processor if compared to base MBP 13 2020."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8662,Do you experience any lags if day you open 5tabs and Netflix at the same time?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8663,"Thanks bro, did you encounter any laggish performance if you were to open multiple tabs and Netflix"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8663,At the same time for example.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8664,Just did a check for u
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8664,and i still do not encounter any lags with 5 tabs opened and streaming
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8664,youtube （set at 1080 in the background.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8664,Also tried switching to microsoft word and excel time to time and back to webpages and youtube.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8664,So far no lags and have not heard fan noise since day one.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8664,Base of MBA is slightly warm but not abnormally warm or hot.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8664,*
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8664,no Netflix account
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8664,so can only test on youtube and mewatch .
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8665,thanks bro!
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8665,appreciate it
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8666,So far I have not encounter the rainbow wheel.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8667,MacBook Air base model i3 is good enough but better upgrade ram to 16 GB.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8667,You could see review in here.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8668,Just to point out the upgrade of RAM for base model MBP is half price compared to MacBook Air.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8669,"But upgrading to a 16gb ram instead , will it ever fulfill its potential?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8669,"I mean wont it start to throttle because of mba thermals issue, you probably wont even reach 16gb by then."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8670,"Thanks bro, most likely getting the base model for some light normal usage"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8671,Now using mbp with 8 gb ram and open 10 tabs
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8671,it taken around 6 gb.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8671,If you like open many tabs and app it better to have 16 gb ram.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8672,do u feel the heat when u used the air on your lap?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8673,I have also been using the I3 macbook air for 1 week now.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8673,I was using the 2017 macbook pro base version prior to switching to this.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8673,The macbook pro was giving me some problems
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8673,so i thought better to get rid of it and buy this chio-er macbook air.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8673,So fast so good.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8673,Love the keyboard and love the new rose gold colour!
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8673,the only downside is the front facing camera.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8673,really poor.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8673,No overheating issues yet!
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8674,Wah now very torn i3 8gb or 16gb ram
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8675,Recommend my MacBook Air 2017
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8675,Spec:
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8675,1.8Ghz
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8675,Intel Core i5.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8675,8GB Ram
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8675,I am selling it at $1200.00.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8675,8GB is more than enough...
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8676,Maybe you would choose mbp after see this review.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8677,Yeah MBP higher end model has 2 fans which is linked to cpu.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8677,Much better.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8678,"Just like I said earlier in this thread, the thermal problem with the macbook air just makes it ""not recommended""."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8678,"And in 2-3 years time, with regular updated OS, updated programs, more high intensity web surfing, more video calls, this machine just will not cut it."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8678,Constantly letting the macbook air running at high temperature will compromise the logic board.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8679,I would recommend MacBook Pro if you are doing Video Editing most of the time.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8680,Is MacBook Air worth the $400 saving?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8680,Would be getting it on the education store.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8681,Is 8gb ram or 16gb ram better for mba?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8681,Cos
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8681,the upgrade is $270 and Im not sure how to fully utilised 16gb ram?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8681,"If I open a lot of apps or tabs, I will be using the ram more but wouldnt"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8681,the mba be trottling more heat and slowing down the performance?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8681,"I can understand the upgrade from base model i3 to i5, mainly its cheap $150."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8681,But not sure about the ram???
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8681,Any seniors views on this?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8682,If you open a lot of apps or tabs better to choose mbp.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8682,"You could read review of this website and look section of "" System Performance  MacBook Air fast enough for basic tasks """
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8682,"They said However, you should not do too much multitasking or use too many browser tabs at the same time, otherwise you can notice some slight stutters."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8682,"The MacBook Air is hardly suited for power users anyway, and this is also the case for the more expensive SKUs with quad-core CPUs."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8682,"The MacBook Pro 13 is a much better device for more demanding applications, for example."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8683,8GB is more than enough for normal usage.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8683,"You need more if doing video/photo editing, playing games, doing huge spreadsheets, which all these activities are harsh on the MBA, ie."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8683,not recommended unless u like to hear the fans spinning loudly all the time.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8683,My MBA 2011 has only 4GB RAM and my child can still use it for the HBL.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8684,"if open 8-10 tabs  and running ms office in the background, 8gb ram is suffice?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8685,"If your tabs are on Safari and not playing videos in every tab, should be more than enough."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8686,For MacBook Air 2020 with i3 and 8 gb ram would it smoothly using chrome opened 20 tabs ?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8687,Depends on the sites as well.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8687,"If you are playing videos, then probably even i7 cannot take it."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8688,Why would u need to open 20 tabs at a time???
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8688,What are you micro-managing?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8688,Thats too over hahaha
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8688,"As said, even i7"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8688,or I think Mbp also got difficulties in running smoothly
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8689,"IMHO, it's worth the pain."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8689,You'll not feel a need to upgrade for the lifespan of the Mac.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8689,And you won't be able to anyway..
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8690,u can if u like listening to the full force of the fan.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8690,haha...
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8691,In MacBook Pro 2017 with i5 dual core and 8 gb able to do it smoothly.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8691,I mean smoothly visit each tabs in chrome.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8692,Anyone knows when Apple Store is reopening
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8693,at least till the CB is released.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8694,New macbook air 13 2020 inner lcd crack
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8694,", heart broken"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8694,what happened to Apple products?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8694,"why it is so fragile, my children just played around, why ???"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8694,newly bought and received at the beginning of May 2020
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8695,"it is always somebody's fault, not yours, right?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8696,"You mean other brands of laptop can withstand your children's ""playing around""?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8696,Typical sinkie... blame everything else but themselves.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8696,"And nope, you can forget about Apple helping you for this."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8697,Oouch.....
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8698,how your children play around ?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8698,jump on it ?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8699,I'm thinking of getting the MBA i5 16gb ram.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8699,My daily usage will be zooms with occasional screen sharing.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8699,"about 15 tabs - mixture of multiple emails, youtube in safari and chrome."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8699,2-3 excel sheets in the background.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8699,Can it handle without the high temps and fans to max?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8700,Go get yourself a base MBP instead.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8700,I returned my MBA i5 8gb after a few days.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8700,"Its really good at blowing out a lot of hot air, and not to mention the jet engine noise when the fan is running at full speed."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8700,Running zoom with screen sharing is too taxing for MBA.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8701,"Hi, wanna ask for opinions on MBA 2020."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8701,I am gonna study BSc Cyber Security & Forensics
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8701,and i think there are some modules that requires some coding work.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8701,May i ask if MBA is good enough or i should get MBP base model
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8701,or i should get a Windows laptop like the Surface Laptop 3
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8701,I think the coding programs are in Windows environment and using a Macbook runnin Windows is a waste of $$$.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8702,If u cannot switch mindset then just go with surface.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8702,There are definitely some unique programs for Windows only but there is always alternatives to the solutions with MAC.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8702,Use what u feel will cause u less problems for ur studies.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8702,I personally use a MAC because its easier for me.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8703,Why not you first find out which are the softwares are used in the course you mentioned ?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8703,"Also why not you also find out from the institute admin office, suppose if you are using Mac, will using a Mac impede your learning where software is incompatible across the OS."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8703,"Like the earlier post, it is hard to imagine these days in the software engineering perspective where a Mac will hinder."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8703,"In a lot of cases, cyber security courses may touch on Linux/Unix software too, then how ?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8703,Get a Linux box ?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8703,Virtual machine will be your option.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8703,"MBA will be good enough, but good enough is subjective."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8703,"For me, I will think a 13"" MBP might benefit you more."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8703,These are your options.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8704,Anyone extend their display to a monitor?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8704,What adaptor are your guys using?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8704,Can I check do we need to plug in the power adaptor while displaying to monitor.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8704,"My worry is that if we keep plugging the power to the display adaptor, will it eventually spoilt the MacBook Air battery."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8705,"Using MBP 15, if your MBA has USB-C, you can choose the following."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8705,USB-C
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8705,To Dell
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8705,U2720Q.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8705,Power just to monitor.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8705,"The rest of the connectivity for data, video, audio, power between the laptop and monitor is via the single USB-C cable"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8705,The latest Mac OS X will attempt not to fully charge the battery even if you are plug in all the time.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8705,This is Apple attempt to help length the lifespan of the Lithium matters.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8705,In any case Lithium battery cannot be overcharged under normal usage perimeter because any proper design would have to control the voltage of the battery properly for it to be safe.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8706,ok.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8706,thanks!
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8706,"manage to connect it without plugging in the usb c cable, use the 2nd port and it was working fine without power adaptor."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8706,only when battery is low then i plug in.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8706,now my setup is complete!
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8707,I think refurbished unit should be hitting the store soon.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8708,Just received my MacBook Air 2020 yesterday and encountered the below issue.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8708,Whole computer will hang suddenly for like 30s then screen will power off.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8708,Followed by about 2s of fan spinning at what seems like max speed.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8708,After that it will restart and boot up normally with a pop out stating macbook had encountered a problem.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8708,Happened at least once yesterday and today.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8708,Any idea what happened?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8708,Should I initiate a return?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8708,Thanks
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8709,Less than 1 week old?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8709,Yeah ask for replacement
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8710,"Hi, wanna ask for opinions on MBA 2020."

mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8712,"Like the earlier post, it is hard to imagine these days in the software engineering perspective where a Mac will hinder."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8712,"In a lot of cases, cyber security courses may touch on Linux/Unix software too, then how ?"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8712,Get a Linux box ?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8712,Virtual machine will be your option.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8712,"MBA will be good enough, but good enough is subjective."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8712,"For me, I will think a 13"" MBP might benefit you more."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8712,These are your options.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8713,Anyone extend their display to a monitor?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8713,What adaptor are your guys using?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8713,Can I check do we need to plug in the power adaptor while displaying to monitor.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8713,"My worry is that if we keep plugging the power to the display adaptor, will it eventually spoilt the MacBook Air battery."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8714,"Using MBP 15, if your MBA has USB-C, you can choose the following."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8714,USB-C
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8714,To Dell
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8714,U2720Q.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8714,Power just to monitor.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8714,"The rest of the connectivity for data, video, audio, power between the laptop and monitor is via the single USB-C cable"
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8714,The latest Mac OS X will attempt not to fully charge the battery even if you are plug in all the time.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8714,This is Apple attempt to help length the lifespan of the Lithium matters.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8714,In any case Lithium battery cannot be overcharged under normal usage perimeter because any proper design would have to control the voltage of the battery properly for it to be safe.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8715,ok.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8715,thanks!
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8715,"manage to connect it without plugging in the usb c cable, use the 2nd port and it was working fine without power adaptor."
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8715,only when battery is low then i plug in.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8715,now my setup is complete!
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8716,I think refurbished unit should be hitting the store soon.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8717,Just received my MacBook Air 2020 yesterday and encountered the below issue.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8717,Whole computer will hang suddenly for like 30s then screen will power off.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8717,Followed by about 2s of fan spinning at what seems like max speed.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8717,After that it will restart and boot up normally with a pop out stating macbook had encountered a problem.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8717,Happened at least once yesterday and today.
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8717,Any idea what happened?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8717,Should I initiate a return?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8717,Thanks
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8718,Less than 1 week old?
mba 2020,Apple,MacBook Air,8718,Yeah ask for replacement
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8719,The new updated MacBook Pro 13 2020 with scissor switch is out!
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8720,Nice!
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8720,Finally better keyboards.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8721,2.0GHz version is Intel 10th
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8721,Gen~
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8721,while base model is 8th
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8721,Gen~
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8721,Limit 5 per customer.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8721,interesting.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8721,"now is the wait for 10th Gen for 16""~"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8722,Yes you are right.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8722,"SG$800 more for a newer, faster processor, 2x"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8722,"faster RAM, double the storage and 2 additional TB3 ports."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8722,I think its worth it.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8723,Education price is attractive.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8723,Posted from Hell B18 HardwareZone Forums
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8723,app
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8724,It is cheaper than before with upgraded spec.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8724,Base model with two ports all get cheaper.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8724,Same price you can double storage than before.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8724,4 ports model
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8724,you get double storage and double ram than befor.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8725,yup!
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8725,the estimates were correct.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8725,the $2699 model comes with 512gb ssd and 16gb ram.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8725,before this price only got you 256gb ssd and 8gb ram.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8725,Great savings across the board.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8725,Plus you get new processors and a decent keyboard.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8726,Faster RAM and storage too.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8727,Yes correct more worth it to get that.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8728,"Sad to see that they didnt size up the screen to 14 inches, oh wells..."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8729,Where is the 14”?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8729,But this time round the mbp quite cheap lay.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8729,"When I bought my tb 2016 13”, spent over 3k plus for 16gb n 512ssd."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8730,Website laggy...
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8731,Yes MacBook Pro are getting cheaper.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8731,This is similar to 2015 MacBook Pro which it is the lowest price point to get a MacBook Pro that time.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8731,"After 2016 redesign, price increases again."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8731,"now in the 4th year of the redesign, price becomes another new Low."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8731,I spent $2780 for my MBP 2017 also with 512gb storage and 16GB.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8731,4 ports Touch Bar version.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8731,Now only cost $2549.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8732,It's cheaper now
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8732,cos Apple is preparing for new design with Mini LED later this year.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8732,"14"" and 16"""
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8732,"and and 12"" with ARM chip next year."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8733,Likely to have a new redesign and with ARM chip.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8733,Initially my MacBook Pro 2017 is facing some issues with ghosting problem on the display.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8733,"Surprisingly, now it is solved by itself."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8733,I sent in to Apple authorised dealer to diagnose but they said no issue can be found.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8733,"However, if I were to replace the display, it costed $1k++ with display replacement fee and diagnosis fee."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8733,Lucky
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8733,I did not opt for it.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8734,sweet!
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8734,wait for thermal tests before deciding to get or not
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8735,Nice to see that the price is cheaper comparatively since it's the 5th year of roughly the same redesign.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8735,But no 14 inch display
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8736,its cheaper because apple has finally decided to double the storage and ram.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8736,thats it.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8736,you are paying $600 less than before.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8736,it was quite ridiculous that some 4tb port models in 2016- 2018 started at 128gb and costs $300 to upgrade to 256 and another 300 for 512.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8736,Ram is also $300 more for 8 - 16gb upgrade.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8736,If you checked the 2019 13 inch macbook pros.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8736,it costs 3.2k to get 512gb ssd and 16gb ram.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8736,now the same variant is 2699 sgd.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8737,16gb RAM and 512GB SSD.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8737,Worth it
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8737,lor
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8738,Yes.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8738,It is ridiculously cheaper than before.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8739,That’s because of the new touch bar feature.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8739,"When I got my mid 2015 MBP, was the flagship model at only $3.3k+ 2.5GHz, 16GB RAM, 512GB."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8739,What I really miss about the models from 2016 onwards is the illuminated Apple logo.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8739,"I’m still using it now, still going strong."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8740,Yes it is the touchbar that makes the price up.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8740,Personally I prefer the scissor keyboard on my MBP 2017.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8740,MBP is known to be lasting seriously.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8740,One can easily use it for close to 10 years even.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8741,My 2015 one is also scissors type.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8741,"This is my second MBP as my first was the 2010 one in which shortly after the 5-year mark, GPU failed causing the MBP to auto shutdown and reboot everytime the graphic card switches."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8741,"I’ve a colleague still using his old MBA which is nearly 10 years old, probably the first model"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8741,"I might continue to use my current one until it also gives up, but also might be needing a batt change first as capacity is down to around 84%."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8741,Will see next year’s MBP models as rumoured to be ARM-based.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8742,When will it be available for purchase?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8743,MBP wont go ARM.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8743,It will be a ultra portable which will be going ARM.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8744,10th gen pricing damn not worth it.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8744,Refurb mbp16
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8744,"base model is slightly under $3k, compared to mbp13 10th gen 2.7k."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8744,Though now it is out of stock
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8745,How much cheaper?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8746,Wow.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8746,Think I might get this after a year of using Windows with Lenovo mainly for gaming.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8746,My DBS corporate promo is about 20-30 dollars cheaper than the education promo
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8746,Lol.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8746,I think the price is really not bad for the specs.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8746,I'm still digging the date design.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8747,no wifi 6
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8747,"no 14"" display."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8747,"looks like my 13"""
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8747,late 2013 doesnt need upgrading yet
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8748,Still not able to order.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8749,no news.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8749,surprisingly lion city is not in the first batch list for the new macbook pro 13-inch.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,"also btw, keep in mind if you are after performance and want the best in thermals, the 4 thunderbolt model is alot different internally compared to the 2 thunderbolt model."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,This is the internals of the 2 thunderbolt model
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,This is the internals of the 4 thunderbolt model
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,"The 4 thunderbolt model have better speakers, better thermals, bigger battery though the battery is very small in difference from 54.5w to 58w"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,and if im not wrong better microphones.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,"Additionally, the CPU in these devices are different in terms of their wattage."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,the 2 thunderbolt model is only 15watts vs the 25-28watts
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,on the 4 thunderbolt models.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,"This equals more performance, thats why the 2 thuderbolt model starts at 1.4ghz processor vs the 2.0ghz"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,on the 4thunderbolt models
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,"The better thermals is NOT just because of the 2 fans, but the chassis design too."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,"If you are familiar with the 2012-2015 retinas, the bottom of the macbook pro"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,theres 2 slits at the edges for additional airflow.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,The 2 thunderbolt port macbook pro is more reminiscent of the macbook air.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,The intake and exhaust is all in the hinge of the macbook.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,I hope this helps your purchase decision when it comes to the pros.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,I returned my 2020 macbook air due to the heat issues i was facing with the laptop.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,If you are contemplating a macbook air instead of the pro.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,It really depends on what you will be doing/your workflow.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,"The macbook air is fine if you are using just for spotify, social media, emails, netflix."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,But thats it.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,Anything more it will start to heat up and the fans will kick in.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,High temperatures and loud fan noises is what made me return it.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,"Now with how we are working from home due to covid-19, i noticed the computer start to stutter with just video call and safari and"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,maybe my word application open.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,"When I tried to screen share, the laptop just slows to a crawl with the fans at max speed and temps at 100 degrees."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,"If you really want the air, get the base model with i3, at SGD$1,449 for a modern 2020 macbook, its a good deal."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,the i3 version has better thermals compared to the i5.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,"If you do pick the i5, its already at SGD$1,599."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,"I would really recommend you to get the base model macbook pro for SGD$1,799."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,The thermals alone is worth it imo.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8750,"Dont be fooled by the spec sheet of the macbook air with its 10th generation i5, that i5 processor performs worse compared to the 8th generation i5s found in the macbook pro due to the thermal constraints of the macbook air."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8751,I guess should be very soon.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8751,The MacBook Air is available for order within 24 hours or so after announcement.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8752,@MilgaussSC very good info
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8753,one of the best posts i've seen in this forum in YEARS.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8753,kudos man!
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8754,Thanks for the insightful post.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8754,I ordered the MBA with i5 and am returning it because of the constant high temps 100C and more than >8000 rpm fan noise.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8754,I have attempted to use turbo switcher to turn off turbo boost but the program does not work all the time.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8754,This is based on just using light surfing of internet Youtube and playing videos and the fan speed and temps
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8754,will go up.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8754,May I know which MBP are you planning to get?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8754,Will you be getting the 10th gen 13 inch MBP for the better thermals?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8754,My concern is that the 8th gen 13 inch MBP may have similar thermal issues like the MBA.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8755,were u using Safari or other browser?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8756,I will be getting the 10th gen variant.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8756,"Either with 16gb ram, 512gb and i7, or the 16gb ram, 1tb and i5."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8756,I’m waiting on reviews for the i5 vs i7.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8756,I want a laptop to last me 4 years minimum.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8756,My old 15 inch 2015 lasted me 4 years++ without any issues.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8756,"As for you concern, there are plenty of reviews of the 8th gen variant."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8756,Just search 2019 13inch base model MacBook Pro 13.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8756,Many YouTube videos of it.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8756,It’s essentially the same laptop only with the removal of the butterfly keys and double the storage
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8757,i'm wondering if apple will pull the same stunt they did last year....
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8757,"release a 15"" in and then the 16"" in nov."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8757,i am in the market for a new laptop
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8757,and like you i'm just keeping an eye out on the reviews in the days to come....
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8757,"really wished the rumours were true about the 14"""
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8758,I am using Chrome.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8758,I have also read that many people that doesn't face the thermal and fan issues while using Safari.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8758,"However, if my i5 MBA cannot handle basic Youtube in Chrome or playing videos requiring constant 100C and >8000rpm fan speeds, then I am not sure if I should continue using it perhaps my MBA is a faulty set, or Chrome is the culprit here."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8758,There was also one night where the fan kept running at full speed
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8758,the noise is evidently loud despite the lid being closed
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8758,I believe I only had the Chrome browser kept open.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8758,"Like many others, I decided to ignore the fan noise and use it for a few days but it gets annoying at times even at low or mild usage of web browsing no gaming or photo/video editing on the MBA."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8758,"After using the MBA for 14 days, I guess returning the MBA would be the best option."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8758,I have 3 other older Macbooks 2 Macbook Pros and 1 Macbook and never experienced such loud fan speed noises for simple or light use of applications.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8758,"The i3 MBA may fare better from fan noise and thermal issues, but I can't comment personally since I don't own one."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8758,"Planning to replace the MBA with the new 13 MBP, hopefully I won't face similar thermal/fan noise issues."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8758,"Same here, will also wait for more reviews to come out."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8758,"My main concern is with the thermals and fan noise issues, hopefully this ain't the problem with the improved thermals of the MBP as compared to the MBA."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,"Yup, I pretty much experience the same thing as you."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,"I understand what Apple is doing with the macbook air cooling design, the fan is NOT a CPU fan, its more of a case fan."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,Think of an exhaust fan at the back of a tower desktop.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,"However, I can't help but feel that a heat pipe would have been so much better."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,But what do I know.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,"I want a macbook that will last me 3 - 5 more years, with the air always at 70 - 100 degrees constantly, I doubt it will last that long."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,"Also, I thought I could tolerate the fan noise too."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,"Initially, I was"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,I thought the fan was not too bad.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,"But after a while, when I'm just video calling and browsing on safari, the fans are at 5000 - 7000rpm."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,It's just annoying.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,"Also, I experienced that issue with you where I closed the lid overnight."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,"The next morning when I woke it up, it was uncomfortably hot."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,I only had discord and safari open.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,That's it.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,Another thing I would like to mention is regarding touch id on the macbook air.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,It doesn't work half the time!!
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,"I don't know if it's just my unit or what, but touch id on it is really hit or miss."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8759,Maybe the thing is just stuttering or something and struggling to keep up with processes.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8760,"hey you mention that the internal of 2 Thunderbolt model of mbp look similiar to the mba, then why do advise to go for the mbp instead of the mba when it cost more?"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8760,won't it have the same thermal issue if that's the case?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8760,i got until the 9 May to decide whether to return my i5 mba 2020
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8760,lol.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8760,touch
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8760,id is working fine for me.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8760,i use brave browser instead of safari and chrome.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8761,The cooling in terms of exhaust and intake is similar.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8761,The intake and exhaust are both at the hinge.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8761,"HOWEVER, the 13inch 2 thunderbolt port has a heatpipe connected to the heatsink."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8761,Makes a big difference.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8761,The 4 thunderbolt model intakes air from the slots at the bottom of the chassis and exhausts it at the hinge.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8761,If lets say
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8761,"youre happy with your i5 air, you can keep it."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8761,There are use cases where the i5 makes sense.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8761,$200 is quite substantial in savings.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8761,You might not need the additional performance from the pros.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8761,"If youd like to know more about the $1,799 pro, check reviews of the 2019 MacBook Pro."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8761,Heres
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8761,"a comparison of the MacBook Pro 2019 2 thunderbolt its the same as the 2020 2 thunderbolt, except the keyboard and storage had been upgraded."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8761,Jump to 7 mins in the video.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8761,https://youtu.be/zcj1FpElgwM
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8762,hmm how did u get e internals of e 4port mbp?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8762,I thought nobody has it yet
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8763,i believe he is referencing existing 2TB/4TB port models man.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8764,Can order le.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8764,Delivery date from 11/5 for base model and 15/5 for mid n end model.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8765,The rumour about 14 still stand true.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8765,It will be a complete redesign along with a new 12 ARM and 16.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8766,"what im deciding now is, wait for a refurb 16"" to appear or get the 16/512 13"""
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8766,"i need one to tide me till the 14"" comes outs."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8766,lol.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8766,i do prefer lighter laptops
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8766,"but the 16"" refurb is just a smarter purchase at the expense of my shoulders...."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8766,hmmm
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8767,Thinking about this decision as well.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8767,"My mbp 2014 15"" battery died again yesterday OEM replaced once already."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8767,Time for a change.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8768,"Interestingly, no one has a review unit yet."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8769,Of cos its its not officially launched yet.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8769,Apple sent out the review units as soon as announcement was made.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8770,Are you the Jon prosser of HWZ?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8770,Haha.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8770,Just really wondering if the 14 will be out this year...
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8770,anyones guess
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8771,you will see reviews out when the mbp is shipping.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8771,can't wait to see the reviews to kill the #stayathome time.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8771,haha...
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8772,How come need to kill time?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8772,Dont you need to work?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8772,Employer pay you not to sleep hor.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8773,"For popular YouTubers, they usually have the unit for a week or so before  the announcement."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8774,Not for every product.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8774,"Even then, they can only post when embargo is lifted."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8775,Curious if boot cAmp to win10
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8775,Will the key road affected Id wee need to use Windowss key broad command
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8776,???????
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8777,So who ordered already?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8778,any different from 2018 model other than keyboard?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8779,You mean 2018 Touch Bar model or non-touch bar model?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8780,year yr will have new model Har..
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8780,then I dont buy first
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8780,Liao
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8780,lol
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8780,Will use ipad as my main.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8780,And use windows laptop to download stuff
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8781,Waiting for reviews of the thermals and performance before i order one.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8781,"This is the internals of the 2019 models, but the 2016 - 2019 models have had identical internals."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8781,"With the 2020 2 thunderbolt macbook pro being just a keyboard swap, it most likely will have identical internals."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8781,The 4 thunderbolt port models have always shipped with 28watt processors and the 2 fan design is the only way apple can cool that 28watt processor efficiently in a 13inch chassis.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8781,I would be shocked if the internals arent similar in this new 2020 model
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8782,Although price is tempting
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8782,"but I think my 2016 tb still going strong for remote access, parallels and entertainment."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8782,Just that duno why the coating on screen disappear.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8782,Oil stain can’t clean off.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8782,Guess shall wait for 14” de.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8783,student?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8783,haha...
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8784,"can i just confirm that applecare for macbooks, you must buy within a year from date of purchase?"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8785,Best to get together else
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8785,u might forget.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8785,Like me... twice i forget to buy before end of 12 month!
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8786,Some interesting info about the ice lake chips in the new MacBook pros.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8787,AppleCare+ is within 60 days.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8787,AppleCare Protection Plan is within 12 months.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8788,You are right.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8788,Apple always has limited exclusivity to their CPU and GPU before anyone else and a few of the CPU models will only be exclusive to Apple.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8789,"I like this youtuber's review, tips, comparisons and advice."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8789,Very detail and straight to the point.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8789,Now waiting for his benchmark comparisons.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8790,As in if I will go install windows on MAC
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8790,Will the MAC keybroad affect mine windows
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8790,Short cuts like.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8790,Control C. Control X. Control Z
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8791,I've been thinking to get between the new MBA and the MBP...
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8791,But seems like alot of people are having issues with the fans and overheating!
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8791,Anyone can recommend which configuration I should get?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8791,"I occasionally work with datasets, so will use MATLAB, SPSS..."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8791,What do you all think I should get?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8791,"I currently have a 13"" MBP 2017, and my battery seems like its dying.."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8791,so I'm thinking it may be a good time to get a new model.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8792,Just replace your battery will do
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8793,Agree if the MacBook is serving you well except the battery issue.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8794,I initiated a return today for MBA 2020 😄.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8794,It gets hot while I was using it last night
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8794,"What's the difference between the mbp 13"" 2019 and 2020 besides the keyboard?"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8794,"and is the 2019 mbp 13"" keyboard that lousy?"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8794,I been using a mbp 2011
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8794,and it has an inverted t keyboard already.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8794,I haven't been monitoring the development over the years.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8794,I would love to try the difference at apple store but can't.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8795,Aiyo... Keep seeing pple returning the MBA due to heat issue...
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8795,"To spec both MBA and MBP with i5-10, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD, price diff is S$500."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8795,"As a newbie in MacBook with light usage, dunno if I should spend the extra money..."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8796,Light usage
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8796,no.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8796,Just stick with MBA.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8797,No difference except the keyboard if comparing between the base model.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8797,The fourth gen butterfly keys are actually much improved and has a better typing experience.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8797,I actually like it a lot more than the scissor switch.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8797,"Besides, the butterfly keyboard has 4 years of warranty."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8797,"Any issue, Apple will replace the whole base for you."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8798,"say if i maxed out the specs for a 13"" or 16""."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8798,can this replace my windows desktop ?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8798,cos
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8798,"i wanna try jump back to osx, use windows abit"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8798,sian liao
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8798,i'm considering between PC and Mac now.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8798,Had in mind to build a ryzen rig which cost about 4.8k to 5k
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8798,was using mac mini in 2012
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8798,"then mbp 15"" in 2013-2015."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8798,i dun play games.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8798,"just need to do video rendering, heavy photoshops and illustrator."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8798,which one will be better ?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8798,"13"" or 16"" ?"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8798,any difference in performance between these 2 after maxed out ?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8798,Also can consider iMac if they refresh it this year.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8798,TIA
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8799,You are better off waiting for the new iMac refresh this year.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8799,Its definitely coming.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8800,"ya lor , wait until neck long liao"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8800,my last iMac was
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8800,"a thick bezel/frame one lol,
like got a layer of powder or dust inside the screen."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8800,end up selling it.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8800,forgot when i bought it.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8800,any idea when will it be releasing ?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8801,Still waiting for the first review to appear.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8802,"Not gonna hold out for the 14 inch one, already ordered my dbrand skin first, wait for it to arrive then order on Apple store."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8803,"Getting the slickwrap for my 13"""
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8804,"MacBook Pro 13-inch: come for the keyboard, stay for the performance"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8805,"videos of the 2020 13"" MPB is out, but they are inclined towards the first impression and set up category of content."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8805,performance videos may have to wait for perhaps 1 week or over a substantive period
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8805,I still recall that 2020 MPA performance videos were released after a week or so and thermal issues were reported
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8806,This is the most detailed so far.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8807,I am using the MBP 16
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8807,and I try to avoid chrome too...
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8807,"even if you can take the noise, the battery drain will be there."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8807,No reason to use Chrome.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8808,Always avoid Chrome when using macOS.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8808,Up till now google has yet to optimise Chrome for macOS.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8808,You are better off with alternative like FireFox or Edge Chromium.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8808,Best experience with Safari.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8809,"for those that need Chrome, just use a tab suspender addon."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8809,it will greatly improve e experience with Chrome when multiple tabs r opened.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8810,chrome on windows is also unoptimised.....
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8810,great browser but its such a memory hog!
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8811,Chrome is shiat in windows 10 too.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8812,Will Apple check that you are a student during delivery if I placed my order on the education store?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8813,Posted with iPhone 11 Pro Max HardwareZone Forums app
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8814,Only will check when
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8814,u placing your order or after placed order ?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8814,Will not check when delivering
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8815,Gone leave this thread now guys.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8815,"After much contemplation, I just placed an order for the morning refurb baseline 16 model."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8815,"From what Ive read on reddit and macrumour forums, the user experience on the 13 2020 will be solid."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8815,See ya guys in the 14 thread!when
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8815,it comes
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8816,Base model 8th Gen CPU vs
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8816,high end 10th
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8816,Gen CPU.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8817,Sounds like a good choice.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8817,$240 cheaper than the brand new education price.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8818,Why did you decide on the 16?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8819,give it a go for a few mths and see.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8819,"features wise its richer than the 13"" with the only pain point being the additional weight."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8819,"we shall see how it goes over the next few mths, i took a calculated risk to ""lose"" some $$ if the 14"" comes out"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8819,and i decide i want that
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8820,"looking at the prices on Carousell, buy refurb and sell as 2nd hand don't lose much if any at all."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8821,I was contemplating a 16 inch too.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8821,"Coming from a 2015 15 inch, the footprint is identical and the 16 inch is slightly lighter."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8821,However my needs now meant the 16 inch would be insanely overkill
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8821,and Ive been wanting to switch to a 13 inch due to the size and weight difference.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8821,Interesting video for those coming from a 2012-2015 retina 15 inch.

mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8822,However my needs now meant the 16 inch would be insanely overkill
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8822,and I’ve been wanting to switch to a 13 inch due to the size and weight difference.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8822,Interesting video for those coming from a 2012-2015 retina 15 inch.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8823,exactly.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8823,my curiosity was piqued also
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8824,If you can get the 16 then just do so.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8824,No point going to the 13.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8824,The performance gain is huge and the weight to me is negligible.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8824,"And since you are waiting for the 14, why not just wait for the new redesign 16"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8825,I see.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8825,The refurbished model gone very fast.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8825,You are lucky to grab one.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8826,Which config did you acquire?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8827,"There is another base model 16"" in space grey available if you're keen."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8828,lighter?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8828,i tot
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8828,it is about the same weight?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8828,2kg?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8829,Anyone used the trade-in service before?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8829,How would it work now?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8829,Will we have to drop off our mac somewhere?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8830,Someone will pick it up from you.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8831,I see.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8831,Thanks!
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8832,"Just be patient, every month got at least once available for a week or two in stock."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8832,Of course if you need it immediate then yes seems to not be in stock
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8833,Haha I would wait
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8833,but I need a laptop now.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8833,I got the base model 16
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8833,I7 6 core/16gb ram /512 SSD
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8833,I use iCloud and I manage my space wel.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8833,"Using it for productivity apps, sketch up/autocad"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8833,Edit: Im also used to carrying large laptops around.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8833,Im in IT by trade for offices and large homes.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8833,Figured the 16 made most sense for now and more sellable if I get the rumoured unicorn of a 14 mini-led laptop when its available.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8834,"For Autocad, 16 model is more suitable."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8834,A 13 model will still face bottleneck.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8834,16 is a good buy.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8834,Been using the i9 version and the performance is top class.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8835,"Anyone decided and ordered the new MBP 13"" yet?"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8836,Did you hook up to an external monitor?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8836,Read there are some issues with that.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8837,"If I really like it, may return it get the i9/16gb/1tb/5500m gfx model...."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8837,but the upgrades I dont need la...
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8838,Havent received it
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8838,but Ive read those issues can be worked around.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8838,"Lets not derail the thread with talks of the 16
Back to the 13"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8838,", Reddit users who have received theirs are extremely pleased with the power and keyboard"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8839,The 2.0Ghz 13 this year is really very solid.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8839,Almost comparable with the base model 16.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8840,"Yeah numbers wise, but sheer power core count"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8840,the 16 base still holds it own by a wide margin
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8841,Still stuck between choosing the base new 13 2020 model or a refurb 16 base model
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8841,Not sure whether to go for 1TB upgrade option but
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8841,refurb doesnt have that yet
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8842,Thats for sure as 16 has 2 additional cores.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8842,But the margin has closed up considerably when one encodes and exports
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8842,4K video from Final Cut Pro.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8843,yes but the 16inch is slightly higher.

mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8843,hahahah.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8843,2.04kg vs 2.0kg.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8843,So they are almost identical.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8843,Dimensions and weight.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8843,"Also, if you are planning on getting a 13inch pro, the $2,999 model is so close to the base"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8843,16inch and actually more expensive than a refurb model.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8843,Its really hard to pick.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8843,"Of course if youre just after portability, the 13inch is already your default choice."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8843,"But if youre after power, the 16inch pro refurb is a much much better value."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8843,"Now when I think back, the 15inch pro that I had before, I was fine with it in terms of size and weight, just that the 16inch is so overkill for me and my current workflow."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8843,"but if the difference Is just $400 - 500 for a bigger screen, better performance, discrete graphics, better speakers and microphone and battery life, It might actually be worth it for some folks here."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8843,"So for people who are still on a 2015 15inch or lower, the 16inch pro is the perfect upgrade."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8844,"When you guys are purchasing from the online store, remember to use ShopBack for the 1% cashback."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8844,I just checked out the 13 MBP without using Shopback.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8845,Cancel and re-order.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8846,Do you need the portability?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8846,"16"" has better value but"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8846,portability is very important too for some.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8847,They were too fast for me to cancel and reorder.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8847,Hahaaa.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8847,I got to wait for them to deliver the unit to me and return it in order to do that.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8848,Was contemplating on these two too.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8848,But I found out that the butterfly keyboard from the previous models is really very horrible.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8848,You can do a quick search on YouTube and there are plenty of feedback on the butterfly keyboard.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8849,any reviews on base model mbp?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8850,huh?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8850,e 16 was e first of e recent MacBooks to have e new magic keyboard
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8851,The lastest Gen of butterfly keyboards were much better.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8851,"Besides, Apple has 4 years of warranty cover on them which is super worth it."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8852,Go watch reviews on YouTube.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8853,A typical Mac can last for more than 4 years.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8853,I wont want to keep going to their service centre just to get the keyboard fixed just because of some dust.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8854,"Like I said, the latest gen butterfly keyboard is good."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8854,I had the first gen butterfly keyboard
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8854,and it did experience some issues but
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8854,at least Apple replaced a whole new MacBook with second gen keyboard for me.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8854,Still using the latest butterfly gen from 2018 and the quality has been superb so far.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8854,"With additional 4 years of warranty, I look forward to going into the service centre to have my MacBook replaced"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8854,when its time
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8855,use a external ssd would be cheaper.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8855,"am undecided though whether to up the ram to 16gb for 13 base model just for web surfing, watching netflix and ms office"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8856,how did u get 4 years of additional warranty ?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8857,I guess the additional 4 years of support is for the keyboard only.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8857,It is a service note/advisory to cover the life of this keyboard.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8857,"I'd rather to have a reliable keyboard than one that breaks down every now and then and have to get it serviced/replaced, which can be a hassle."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8858,"For your mentioned usage, 8GB is more than enough."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8859,Agree..
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8859,It also depends on stock availability when you need to replace the keyboard.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8859,So you may end up without the Macbook for a few days or weeks.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8860,oic.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8860,i tot
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8860,can extend device warranty
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8861,"Try checking the ""Max Tech"" channel on Youtube."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8861,I think their videos are quite good.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8861,They have one comparing the base model and the upper tier one.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8862,That depends.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8862,"Usually theyll just replace the whole bottom cover if keyboard runs out of stock or better still, replace the whole MacBook."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8862,"If you are lucky, they might even replace the newer version for you."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8862,I dont want to say much more lol..
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8863,"Can ask, if case like my this tb 2016 mpb, got hope?"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8863,no more warranty le.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8864,What happened to your MacBook Pro?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8865,No idea.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8865,The coating seems no more.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8865,Now the oil stain can't clean off no matter how hard I tried using with the microfiber cloth.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8866,You could found about this issue in here.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8867,This issue Apple will replace the LCD free of charge.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8867,Just go to the support app and select display issues to follow the instruction.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8868,Is it fine to use a underpowered USB charger?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8868,I intend to get a small ultra portable 30W GaN charger when travelling.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8868,The same charger will be used for iphone and Mac Pro.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8868,1
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8868,I do not  expect to charge back to 100% when using as long as it sustain and do not drain fast during the day.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8868,At most I fully run on battery during day time.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8868,2
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8868,I will charge it overnight at the end of the day bringing it back to 100% macbook off or in suspend
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8868,Will it damage the macbook or will it not charge even when powered off?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8868,"I understand USB chargers are not dumb chargers in the past, the voltage and ampere is negotiated between the device/charger before the power flows."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8868,Is this a good idea?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8869,"For 13 MacBook Pro, you can use a 30W charger to charge when the MacBook is idle but it will take a few hours to fully charged it."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8869,"However, the battery life will still deplete if you are charging the MacBook Pro while using since there isnt enough power given to all the components."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8869,Note that slower charging will stress the battery too.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8870,anti reflective coating issue aka staingate.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8870,have been affecting all macbooks with retina display since it was introduced in 2012.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8870,there's no solution that i'm aware of unless you.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8870,1 not clean the display.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8870,2 not to let it come into contact with any kind of object.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8870,3 not pack the laptop in a backpack full with other things as pressure
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8870,will on the chassis will cause the display to come into contact with the keyboard and either dirty the display or scratch the coating
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8870,4 keep it away from heat like using it on clamshell mode.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8870,if your macbook is under apple care they'll replace it for free.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8870,"if it's past the warranty period likely you'll have to pay $800 if i'm not wrong, maybe less or more now unless you have some very good reason to explain."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8870,even after replacing the issue will be back after 2 to 4 years unless you take the precautions I mentioned above.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8870,"i'm using a late 2013 macbook pro retina 13"" and have replaced my display 4 or 5 times when it was under warranty."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8870,today i still face the staingate issue.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8870,there's a facebook group about this isssue as well
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8871,Its fine if you dont intend to charge and use at the same time
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8872,No you dont have to lay even if you dont have AppleCare.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8872,Apple has a replacement program to replace the display on all eligible MacBooks with coating issues up to 4 years from the original purchase date.

mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8874,"Hello all, is it true that there will be a ""back-to-school"" promo in July?"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8874,"So it's not worth for me to buy the MBP 13"" now"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8874,if I am eligible?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8875,There will be a back to school promo.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8875,Usually Apple will just bundle it with a beats headphone.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8875,"If you want that, you can wait."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8875,Else you are better off getting the new MBP13 from the education store.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8876,"nope, likely using at home most of the time, this will replace my dying 2-in-1 tablet at home, stuck between getting a new ITX PC Rig or bite the bullet for once experience MacOS which i've always wanted."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8876,"i thought new 16"" MBP is using the new keyboard?"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8876,"my usage is similar to yours, i won't be doing any editing work, that's why i'm stuck between new base"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8876,"MacBook pro 2020 13"" or go for refurb base MacBook pro 16""."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8876,whether the $500 premium will be worth it since it technically can last longer
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8876,and I might just connect to monitor/TV most of the time
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8876,yet i like bigger tech gadgets
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8876,*
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8876,"can imagine the 16"" display and speaker difference over the 13"" model. ""."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8876,really dilemma.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8877,Yes the 16 MBP is using the new scissor key switches as well.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8877,"Lol since youll be connecting to an external monitor most of the time, why would you need a bigger display or speakers?"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8878,I think back to school not always will have?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8879,i use dual screen mostly now still.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8879,"speaker cause i don't have a dedicated speaker, still relying that on the tablet"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8880,MacBook Air 2020 or MacBook Pro 2020 for uni starters?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8881,Depends on your usage.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8881,Do you need heavy processing?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8881,Any special software that you need to use?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8881,List them down
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8881,so people here can decide whats best for your usage.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8882,"Paiseh got no 16"" thread"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8882,so gotta post here
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8882,"Any better offers than this for 16"" MBP?"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8883,This config is $4749 at retail.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8883,So this is as good as it gets even for return model.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8884,return model means what ah
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8885,can share where that listing is from?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8886,"apple edu store, idk if student or teacher is it the same price boh ?"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8886,mine is a teacher account
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8887,Refurbished model from Refurbished Store
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8887,I mean.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8887,No difference to me between retail or refurb model except for the box.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8888,oic.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8888,aiyah brand new set got more placebo effect for me
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8888,lol
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8888,u tell me is apple refurbed at 4k
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8888,i also won't buy.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8889,"Can someone confirm whether this  new 2020 13"" MBP in SG uses the UK ISO layout for the keyboard rather than the US layout?"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8889,"If Apple SG only sells the UK layout, then that is a deal breaker for me because I'm not at all used to UK layout."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8889,The website shows UK layout
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8889,but I remember previous MBPs had the US layout.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8889,UK Layout
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8889,US Layout
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8890,u can choose from 6 keyboard layouts
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8891,I thought that's just the MacOS keyboard language and not the physical layout?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8891,Please correct me if I am wrong
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8892,Youll be a fool for not considering a refurb model from Apple.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8892,Refurb units from Apple gone through much stringent test compared to retail units.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8893,Agree totally!
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8893,You just need to be patient to get refurb set..
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8894,i dun buy refurbed sets
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8894,cos i usually change a new laptop or gadget within 3-6 mths.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8894,i dun use a machine as long as u guys
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8894,refurbed sets will not fetch as much as brand new sets.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8894,that is my experience tho
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8894,i buy liao
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8894,", i use a while"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8894,i will get bored then change liao.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8894,shortest period i used a macbook air was
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8894,5 days lol
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8894,and that was the stupid butterfly keyboard
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8895,Anyone can confirm the keyboard for refurb sets?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8895,Dont seem to have any description for it and the touch are MBP pro
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8895,all show UK kb on the image
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8896,Refurb set and brand new set when you resell them is all second-hand
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8897,"From what I understand, the 10th gen Intel CPU in the 13 inch"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8897,MBP is the i5-1038NG7.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8897,It seems that the 28W TDP isnt fully utilised because the 13 inch MBPs thermals arent
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8897,that good.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8897,Meaning to say the boosted clock speeds would likely not be realised.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8897,A quick google search showed an article about this based on early benchmarks.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8897,Is it then worth the premium over the 8th gen CPU in the base model?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8897,Context:
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8897,Im currently on the 2015 15 inch MBP with the i7-4870HQ CPU no discrete graphics chip and am thinking of upgrading to a 13 inch MBP.

mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8901,Wanted to test out which was better before returning/selling either one.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8901,The 10th gen difference vs 8th gen is only faster graphics processing and slightly higher multi core performance.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8901,Which to me is negligible because day to day use you most likely only utilise single core.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8901,Unless u are hard up about the lack or ports then get the 10th gen.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8901,If not the 8th gen with 2 ports is more than enough.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8902,"Anyone looking for a 16"" MBP, can try amazon."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8902,It is having a $300 discount right now.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8903,adding shipping and stuff does it make sense?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8903,and of course the power socket is diff plug also
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8904,I will most likely go with a 10th gen processor due to the better integrated graphics.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8904,"Comparing the i7-1060N7 on the MBA and i5-1038NG7 on the MBP, the benchmarks seem to suggest what you have described I.e. similar single core performance, better multi core performance."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8904,"But at 512GB SSD / 16GB RAM configuration, the MBP cost $300 more and has 2 additional USB C ports."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8904,My consideration would be: does the MBP have longer battery life and better screen?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8904,Weight wise seems similar 1.27kg vs 1.4kg.

mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8905,why are they giving discounts ?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8905,is it a new refresh is coming or they wanna clear this batch for new model ?

mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8909,"The speakers for the 16"" is insanely good!"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8909,I don't think there's any laptop that can beat the sound!
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8909,I would really suggest to re-consider if you can pay a little more.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8909,Refurbished sets seems to come with brand new cables and charger and battery.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8909,Didn't know that they will change the outershell too.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8910,"I think we should have 16"" MBP thread!"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8910,Haha.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8911,Then it to question do you bring it around Everyday.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8911,To me the 100g is negligible.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8911,But I can guarantee the MBA lasts longer day to day.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8911,Performance wise MBP will outclass MBA by 60% due to better thermals and MBA at the fly is hot when running cpu intensive stuff like.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8912,Apple increase upgrade upgrade prices ☹️
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8913,we already have one
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8914,"I was looking at the base macbook pro with 16gb ram, was gonna buy but too late."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8914,Now have to fork out additional 150$ for the same thing....
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8914,zzzzzzzzzzz
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8915,Chrome or Safari?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8915,5mins/1% seems quite reasonable
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8916,"So most prob i will go for MBP base model, thinking if i should just pony up $500 and get the 10th gen and be happy for years."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8916,Or just stick to the MBP base model as a stop gap solution till next year when the new 14inch mini led mbp launches.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8917,Raise another few hundreds also no issue since isheeps r rich.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8917,Sent from Rem Best Grill using GAGT
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8918,is boot camp stable?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8918,my last was mbp in 2010 while i was a student.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8918,currently using wins but seems like the laptop gonna die soon.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8918,"now that i only using it to surf the internet and do design work once in a while, was thinking of getting back to macOS wagon."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8919,stick to windows laptops if u want to run windows.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8920,there are certain application which i need to run in windows.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8920,thanks for your feedback.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8921,if there r only certain applications
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8921,"u can try VMs in macOS using virtualbox, parallels etc"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8922,finally made the decision to purchase the mbp 13
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8923,What is the spec ?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8924,"Hi Apple expert,"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8924,Can i check if student price is the cheapest way to get a macbook now?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8924,I would like a MBA 2020
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8924,but I have heard of thermal issue.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8924,Or would MBP be better even though it is $450 more?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8924,Would you guys recommend getting applecare?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8924,I may not be using this laptop alot very
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8924,I already have a desktop at home and
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8924,the reason I want to buy a laptop is because I am enrolling in some basic upskilling computing modules.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8924,Please advise.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8925,Cheapest is to wait for it to be released in refurb store bah
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8925,Base 2019 16 inch MBP
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8925,Retail :
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8925,$3499.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8925,Student : $3209.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8925,Refurb : $2969
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8925,So refurb mac with student applecare probably lowest cost.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8926,"wait for 1 month more or so, during Back To School promo, they will give you a headset, last year is beats, this year US's is airpods."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8926,get to buy the mac with student price
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8926,sell off the headset and you get to buy a better price
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8927,my apologies.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8927,been some time since i last used a mbp.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8927,was wondering does anyone install anti virus on the mbp?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8927,if so can recommend?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8928,"yup, this year back to school offer is quite good, free airpods and can pay extra to upgrade airpods pro."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8929,thanks.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8929,but i installed avg.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8929,lol
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8929,now thinking of installing bootcamp since some apps i need to use win.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8930,When will it be for Singapore?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8931,"if take last few years as reference, it will be around july to september."
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8931,i reckon wait till a while more to enjoy student promo
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8932,"Hi all,
What will be recommended configuration for MBP which i just want to use for simple graphic editing and video editing mainly output to 1080p with Photoshop/"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8932,After Effects/FCP?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8933,"MBP13 with i7, 32gb ram and 1tb cost 3700?"
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8933,Fark expensive
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8934,Need so high specs?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8935,i7 upgrade looks really pointless IMO and at that cost can get 16 inch alr
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8936,my guess will be mid of july and last until early sept or mid of sept.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8936,worth to wait till then for sure if you have plan for macbook purchase or even ipad air or ipad pro purchase.
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8937,Will a refurb version qualify for the free gift?
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8938,Harvey norman better
mbp 2020,Apple,MacBook Pro,8939,Tried using the US Site and the refurb products dont seem to qualify for student gifts

MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8956,check already ..
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8956,previous models have .. but not the 2018 one ..
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8956,i think because quite recent and problems start coming up already when its close to 2 years..
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8956,no buy
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8956,.. tot should be able to last ..
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8956,was thinking to change mbp next yearbecause 16 inch + better keyboard +
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8956,possibly new cpu liao ..
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8956,i check the website its $288
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8956,yea .. now only the latest catalina they have this battery management problem ..
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8956,i check the apple discussion seems like alot of people have the same problem
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8956,i can accept if the battery cannot last as long .. but the swelling like hazard sia ..
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8957,Please replace the battery.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8958,I think Apple care is always a good deal.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8958,Its technology after all.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8958,Bound to fail
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8959,If theres no recall notice means its not really a major issue.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8959,Yours might just be some isolated cases where faults might from manufacturing problems.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8959,"Im still using my mid 2015 one, and Ive absolutely no problems whatsoever since day 1."
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8959,"Battery cycle count is 450 and capacity hovers around the 84-87% range, so which means life a little shorter than normal."
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8959,"I still love it very much due to the different ports it has plus the illuminated Apple logo, which is the last model to have it."
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8959,"The MBP still runs pretty speedy on Catalina, awaiting Big Sur."
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8959,"Those being said, yours technically is out of warranty"
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8959,"so a swollen battery replacement means paying in full, and please stop using immediately for safety reasons."
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8959,Its
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8959,"either you replace the batt or buy a new MBP, which the former is a wiser choice and"
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8959,2018 model is still considered rather new.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8960,I think you should just replace the battery for $288 and then wait for another 1-2 years to buy a new MacBook with ARM.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8960,"As advised by others, meanwhile please stop using the MacBook."
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8961,go to somewhere like macplus if dun want to pay  price on e replacement batt
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8962,not sure ..
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8962,but there are quite alot of people complaining in the apple forums from my search ..
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8962,same 2018 model ..
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8962,my battery cycle not even 100..
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8962,yea probably have to go replace the battery but just saying nv had this problem before .. especially for a premium product
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8962,"and they had this problem before
, makes me think if the problem is still happening .."
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8963,apple store is open to walk in ?
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8963,support say cannot walk in ..
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8963,but online they dont have appointment slot ..
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8963,zzz
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8964,"I have 3 MacBooks, MacBook Pro 2013, MacBook Pro 2018, New MacBook, all had swollen battery problem 1-2 years after purchase, luckily I had 3y AppleCare for all of them so simply sent in and got it replaced, not only battery"
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8964,"but they also need to replace cover, keyboard, touchpad."
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8964,"Strange is, after replaced battery, I no longer had this problem any more,"
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8964,"the MacBook Pro 2013 had battery replaced somewhere in 2015, so far it still looks good."
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,My late 2013 MacBook
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,Pro retina 13 inch
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,the original battery also started to swell
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,but I only noticed it on the 6th year in 2019
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,cause
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,I put it on laptop stand so only when I placed it on flat surface
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,then realise it wobbles.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,It probably started swelling a little in 2018 so roughly around 5 years
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,I think most batteries will swell.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,Paid $288 to change as I didn't see a need to buy the newer MacBook especially with the butterfly keyboard issue.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,Apple will replace the entire bottom half of your MacBook and reuse the motherboard and the bottom plate with serial number engraved
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,unless it got bent excessively then apple will replace with a generic bottom plate with no serial number.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,"So basically you will at least get new top half casing of the bottom, new keyboard, new track pad, and of course new battery."
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,I leave it plugged into power fully charged like almost 95% of the time which the apple staff told me it's not good for the battery and may be the reason for swelling.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,I'm still on OS X El Capitan
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,10.11.6
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,so I believe you don't need the battery health management feature in macOS 10.15.5 as it took 5 to 6 years before the battery started swelling.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8965,If I remember correctly the cycle count was about 600/1000.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8966,"My 2015 model quite recently also have an official from Apple on overheating batts and catching fire, but seems to affect those bought from Sep 2015."
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8966,"Fortunately mine was bought a few days after launch in May 2015, so no issues."
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8966,Premium products are not immune to defects.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8966,"One classic example is that a lot of MBPs are affected by the staingate issue where the coating on the screen wears out unevenly, showing ugly stains on it."
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8967,Quickly change
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8967,Will make the whole laptop burst
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8967,Metal all bent
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8968,"You can but on condition they have staff to serve you whenever theres a free slot, else"
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8968,prepare to wait for at least an hr or two.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8968,"Appointment slots are very limited now due to current restrictions so check back regularly for a slot, but need to wait at least several days now."
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8969,Then book earlier next time.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8970,"You can but on condition they have staff to serve you whenever theres a free slot, else"
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8970,prepare to wait for at least an hr or two.
MBP Battery Swelling,Apple,MacBook Pro,8970,"Appointment slots are very limited now due to current restrictions so check back regularly for a slot, but need to wait at least several days now."

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,8975,Will the OS be a Chinese only version of Win10 with no option for language packs?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,8976,"Considering that it's also launching in India and most international press is covering it as well, I doubt it."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,8977,Looks good.

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,8982,It uses M.2 Sata.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,8982,But supports M.2 NVMe.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,8982,You can still swap out for NVMe drive if you require fast storage speed
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,8983,"If I recalled, It has to be a fresh install of windows + valid cd key."

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,8984,Dgpu is considered a deal breaker for some but not for everyone.

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,8993,"Well, most probably i would be re-installing my own Windows 10."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,8993,"But however even by having Chinese OS, i doubt there will be any issue as you can download language pack."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,8994,Chinese OS is one concern as is a skin down version for China market.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,8994,ie not upgradeable unless fresh install.

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9003,"Rough edges all around, no keyboard backlight, no webcam and there is a recurring problem with the SSD/Motherboard."

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9006,With Renoir ?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9006,Why not you recommend me one ?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9007,"For even lower price, surely forgivable for lack of Renoir"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9007,Or you can tolerate ssd/motherboard issue just for Renoir ?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9008,Well we shall see whether it's an isolated problem or a batch issue for SSD/motherboard when I received it.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9008,"If it's isolated, I'm lucky."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9008,"If it's not, just swap SSD and see how things goes."

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9014,remibook 16?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9015,I would say this notebook isn't suitable for everyone due to the warranty + price ratio.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9015,"Due to it being under the budget series, lots of component choices was pretty subpar SATA Drive instead of NVMe, DDR4 2666Mhz, No Backlit KB."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9015,However the Screen Color & Near

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9015,as it was a preorder price previously.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9016,"Hi bro, did you encounter any hardisk issues?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9017,I did not run into any issue with the default Sata Drive as per what was shown on 1 youtube video.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9017,"Did afew bootup with it with no issue so far during that duration, but had since replaced with my own NVMe drive"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9018,"Cool, sounds like this laptop is quite a good catch."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9018,Maybe after you try out with certain games and let us know is it worth the money.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9018,"I wanted to buy this for video editing, hope it’s good enough."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9018,"Oh btw, u replaced with your own Nvme SSDs"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9018,means you need to reinstall your own OS?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9018,And those free MS office would be gone too?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9019,Sure i'll update the performance once i get my reinstalled windows 10 up and running
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9019,"One thing to take note would be, if any of you guys are considering to reinstall windows 10."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9019,Please take note that Wifi will not be installed with the default driver that is included in windows 10 iso.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9020,Meaning?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9020,Have to download the driver?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9020,If cannot access wifi how to download?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9021,I used my smartphone to hotspot internet via USB.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9021,"After your computer have the network detected, it'll automatically detect and download the relevant drivers."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9021,Not too sure why the default Windows 10 ISO downloaded from Microsoft did not detect hardware and install the generic driver automatically
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9022,Could it be a hardware issue?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9022,"Before you reinstall, was the wifi working?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9023,"Oh its not hardware issue, because my wifi is currently working after i installed the driver through network updates."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9023,Maybe the generic driver was not present in the ISO.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9024,Is it heavy?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9024,Is the screen clear enough?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9025,"Hi Bro, what's your feedback on the Redmi Book so far?"

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9027,Sent from Tehhan's iPhone using GAGT
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,The color is really sweet for its price.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,The 300 Nits of brightness is sufficient for me to view it under sunlight due to
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,it being matte coating as well.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,At least i'm comparing it with the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5 that i owned previously which doesn't seem to produce the hue of red accurately.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,So far the battery life has been pretty surprisngly considering the fact it is only packing 46WHr.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,I could netflix for around 5-6 Hours
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,i still leave me with around 30%+.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,"Already a happy man because the previous Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5, with R7 4700U, the battery draining was pretty bad."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,Only lasting around 6 Hours before the battery got fully depleted.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,Advertised 100% sRGB and 90%
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,Screen Ratio is the key factor for anyone getting this Laptop.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,"Because in actual fact, no KB Backlit lighting and Sata SSD would definitely turn off majority of the users."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,Build & Material quality wise is very good considering for the price that i purchased with.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,No complain on it.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,"Tried running Cinebench, with the setting set at Balance & Turbo R5"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,4500U was pulling a constant 30W maintaining 3.8 Balance and around 35W 3.9-4 Turbo.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,"Laptop itself wasn't particularly warm as well,"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,its cooled pretty thoroughly.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,"In actual use case scenario, at least for photoshop and lightroom editing has been pretty smooth for me"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,No sluggish performance seen so far.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,"Yet to render any Videos yet, but will update once i have the chance."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,So far it has been a pretty good buy for me.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,"But for those who are thinking to buy, please remember by default it comes with SATA SSD."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,I self replaced it with NVMe and reinstalled a Windows 10 Home Automatically activated.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,"ps, from far it really does look like"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9028,"a 16"" Macbook Pro lol"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9029,how come they didn't put the cam
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9029,LOL..
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9030,Thats another factor for user who ware looking to buy this laptop who needs to have cam for work related.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9030,"Tbh i never use any of my laptop cam, even for WFH at least for my companu we dont do video conferencing so lucky me"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9031,"Actually it can be a pro or con, shy ppl should just get this laptop."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9031,"if company ask you to turn camera, you say I don't have one"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9032,Really need to use this excuse.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9033,seriously it's a dem good excuse....
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9034,You know how people are pasting stickers or attaching covers over their webcams?

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9036,I reinstalled it with the default windows 10 that was downloaded off microsoft website.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9036,"I was expecting to activate with my own Windows key, however it just automatically got activated."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9036,I think the previous Windows key Chinese OS was embedded in the motherboard or something

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9041,"Actually by default, there isn't much bloatware for the Chinese OS."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9041,Its just a limited version of Windows only due to Chinese regulations.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9042,Got two zoom meetings today.

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9054,Charges through barrel head

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9078,china forwarder can use ezbuy.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9078,but better buy insurance
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9079,There is no need for 3rd party forwarder when buying from official flagship stores on platforms for example JD.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9079,They will ship direct to your designated address.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9079,"Similar to ""shipped/"

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9080,Thanks bro!
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,Pretty straight forward registration similar to NewEgg or Amazon.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,I used a SG CC for purchase.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,"JD should take care of the shipping when you buy from the vendor's ""Self operated official flagship store"""
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,It will be helpful if you can read and understand
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,chinese
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,", although you can use google translate, but certain meanings might be lost to translation."

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,which i didn't bother because reading them gives me headache.

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,"while making payment, I had experienced the website kicked me back to the login page if i don't."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,Note:
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,There are times where by the flagship stores themselves do not want to entertain overseas purchases for certain batches of goods.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,"Same when as you go into newegg US or amazon US when the item added in the cart ""disappear"" after changing location to SG."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,"Also, Anyway, Why Mechrevo S2 Air 4600H?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,is it because it is thin and light?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,"14"" 1.13kg."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,is it because it has the ability to run the processor in 65watt?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,is it because it has better cooling among ultraportables?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,2heatpipes+2Fans
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,Why not the Mechrevo S2 Air 4800H?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,is it because the price difference is $160 SGD?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9081,Or simply because it is currently out of stock?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9082,Thanks for taking the effort to reply bro!
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9082,"Gonna be using it just for uni, got desktop at home already,"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9082,so I dont think worth the money to upgrade to the 4800H
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9082,", whats your opinion on this bro?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9082,Btw do you think the Mechrevo S2 Air is a good deal?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9082,"Originally planning on buying the USD599 Lenovo Flex 5 4500U off Amazon, but always no stock so looking for alternatives now."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9082,Would like something like a 2-in-1
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9082,/Touchscreen so can take notes
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9082,but I think dont have also nvm
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9083,Specs and Prices wise
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9083,it looks to be a good deal.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9083,The Mechrevo S2 Air looks to be the most powerful thin and light notebook with the 4600H/4800H.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9083,"Though mechrevo might be a smaller ""reseller"" compared to the other big manufacturers, if you are comfortable with that."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9083,Note that buying from overseas be it Lenovo or other brands
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9083,your warranty will be base on the that region unless stated otherwise.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9084,"From what I read the ODM is Tongfang, and the S2 Air is the new version of the laptop that Walmart used to sell as Motile"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9084,and I think the general view is that its pretty good.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9084,So yea I guess I'll be pretty comfortable with it.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9084,Just not too sure about the cooling capability of this laptop and also the battery life...
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi,Redmi Ryzen,9084,Couldnt find much about it online between it being a China release and being a new release

LG brand 14,LG,,9110,Wait for it to be released.
LG brand 14,LG,,9110,14z90n -- has ice lake processor and Wifi6 and thunderbolt3.
LG brand 14,LG,,9110,Unfortunately only 8gb ram and 512gb storage though.
LG brand 14,LG,,9111,??? meaning
LG brand 14,LG,,9112,Went to best denki today.
LG brand 14,LG,,9112,Now the new gram got promo...
LG brand 14,LG,,9112,Free upgrade to 16gb ram and pay 118 to upgrade to 2x512gb ssd
LG brand 14,LG,,9113,"new 10th gen model is out, can do pre order at best vivo city,
new gram price over old gram is $300 difference."
LG brand 14,LG,,9113,see which one u prefer ba.
LG brand 14,LG,,9113,"gram has 2 strong points, weight and battery life, no one able to win them on this 2 things combine, and military grade tested also."
LG brand 14,LG,,9113,means drop wont spoil lol
LG brand 14,LG,,9114,Only thing is compared to other ice lake laptops this one use only ddr4 2666 ram Vs lpddr4x 3733
LG brand 14,LG,,9115,i think latest 2020 grams are ddr4 3200
LG brand 14,LG,,9115,"but yes, could have used lpddr4 rams instead"
LG brand 14,LG,,9116,I saw the brochure write ddr4 2666 only though.
LG brand 14,LG,,9116,"Officially, ice lake supports up to ddr4 3200."
LG brand 14,LG,,9116,Not sure how this will affect igpu performance.
LG brand 14,LG,,9117,should be 3200mhz.
LG brand 14,LG,,9117,saw the brochure on their website
LG brand 14,LG,,9118,Oh nice!
LG brand 14,LG,,9118,That's good to hear then...
LG brand 14,LG,,9118,Thinking of whether to get this and then sell away the Dell XPS 13 9300 which I ordered last week and supposed to come next week...
LG brand 14,LG,,9119,If u planning to get this let me know.
LG brand 14,LG,,9119,Got lobang
LG brand 14,LG,,9120,I'm curious.
LG brand 14,LG,,9120,Can Pm me?
LG brand 14,LG,,9121,Challenger at bugis has stock for this.
LG brand 14,LG,,9121,The screen doesn't look very nice though.
LG brand 14,LG,,9121,"Glossy, but isn't very bright."
LG brand 14,LG,,9121,on their demo set I also noticed that the colours are a bit uneven -- white background is a bit reddish on one side and greenish on the other.
LG brand 14,LG,,9121,"Build quality wise, you press down a bit then"
LG brand 14,LG,,9121,"can see the whole laptop ""bend"" already."
LG brand 14,LG,,9121,A bit flimsy.
LG brand 14,LG,,9121,Imo the Acer Swift 5 seems like a better laptop than this.
LG brand 14,LG,,9121,Unfortunately the swift 5 is saddled by a QLC SSD and...
LG brand 14,LG,,9121,Well it's Acer
LG brand 14,LG,,9121,lol
LG brand 14,LG,,9122,what is the price for the i5 and i7 for the new 90n model.
LG brand 14,LG,,9122,will be getting it soon
LG brand 14,LG,,9122,if not much from the 990 model.
LG brand 14,LG,,9122,thanks.
LG brand 14,LG,,9123,"bro, you have good price lobang."
LG brand 14,LG,,9123,Pls PM me.
LG brand 14,LG,,9123,I need to get it fast by latest April.
LG brand 14,LG,,9124,Valueclub Hachi now selling for 1899 i5 and 2199 for i7.
LG brand 14,LG,,9124,Are you a challenger member?
LG brand 14,LG,,9124,Yesterday best denki Funan quote me 2250 for i7
LG brand 14,LG,,9125,"i5 990 model 14"" at harvey norman only $1699 with $200 plus free gift"
LG brand 14,LG,,9126,can pm me too
LG brand 14,LG,,9127,got what free gift?
LG brand 14,LG,,9127,"Z90N also got the free ram upgrade, free sleeve etc from the service centre..."
LG brand 14,LG,,9128,you can chk it out on Lg/sg/ website and pick where to buy and select H.Norman store.
LG brand 14,LG,,9128,Their free gift as stated there are .
LG brand 14,LG,,9128,"1TB portable Harddisk, 1 portable bluetooth speaker, I usb-c multiport adaptor and1wireless mouse ."
LG brand 14,LG,,9128,Total =s256.70
LG brand 14,LG,,9128,But i doubt the above cost that much.
LG brand 14,LG,,9128,Need to chk the physical items.
LG brand 14,LG,,9128,"Anyway I still prefer the 990 over the 90N.
even the later have better spec.."
LG brand 14,LG,,9128,but ....... Not becos of $.
LG brand 14,LG,,9128,if not will be the new Thinkpad model.
LG brand 14,LG,,9129,If not because of money then why ah?
LG brand 14,LG,,9129,Just curious.
LG brand 14,LG,,9129,"The two models look identical, justt hat"
LG brand 14,LG,,9129,"the z90 has ice lake with iris plus graphics, thunderbolt 3 and Wifi6."
LG brand 14,LG,,9129,These three features enough to make me choose the newer model anyday...
LG brand 14,LG,,9129,"I just clarified with digital hub the distro though,"
LG brand 14,LG,,9129,apparently the SSD upgrade to 1tb is not applicable for the newer model
LG brand 14,LG,,9130,"haha, Dun overlook on the better spec , there are many more on the laptop to make the final consideration."
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,How much does the 15Z90N and the 17Z90N cost?
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,"BTW, by default, they come with 16GB RAM DDR4 3200MHz,"
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,right?
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,What NVMe SSD brand are they using?
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,The LG GRAM allows the use of external power bank to charge it.
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,Anyone knows which power banks can be used?
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,The only gripes I have are.
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,a
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,No touch screen.
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,b
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,No
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,4K screen.
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,c Only 1 USB-C port
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,d
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,It's
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,TB port is weak and useless as far as connecting to eGPU for gaming is concerned.
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,This has been tested in the version before the 90N series and the video is on YouTube by D2D
LG brand 14,LG,,9131,Thanks
LG brand 14,LG,,9132,"Can check Harvey Norman, challenger website for price."
LG brand 14,LG,,9132,Currently Challenger offering 100 off if you buy from Hachi.
LG brand 14,LG,,9132,"By default is 8gb ram, but buy now till 30 april free upgrade to 16gb at Lg Service centre."
LG brand 14,LG,,9132,SSD yesterday when I checked the demo set at challenger bugis
LG brand 14,LG,,9132,it was a Samsung
LG brand 14,LG,,9133,Checked websites.
LG brand 14,LG,,9133,Not there yet
LG brand 14,LG,,9133,"The demo set was 14, 15 or 17 inch?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9134,Demo set was 14 inch.
LG brand 14,LG,,9134,There's also a 17 inch demo set
LG brand 14,LG,,9134,but I didn't check the SSD.
LG brand 14,LG,,9135,Thank you
LG brand 14,LG,,9135,But no mention of free 8GB RAM upgrade to 16GB RAM.
LG brand 14,LG,,9135,"Also, no mention of warranty"
LG brand 14,LG,,9136,Also need to take note of the CA3 and BA3 on the model.
LG brand 14,LG,,9136,As CA3 is Home and BA3 is Pro.
LG brand 14,LG,,9136,Both are 64bits .
LG brand 14,LG,,9136,but again if you hold a genuine pro activation key you can use it to do a upgrade online.
LG brand 14,LG,,9136,Again most do not need the Pro series.
LG brand 14,LG,,9136,As for the ram.
LG brand 14,LG,,9136,it only have a single slot.
LG brand 14,LG,,9136,So need to remove the 8 to put in the 16.
LG brand 14,LG,,9136,As for the SSD they have 2 slots.
LG brand 14,LG,,9137,"I will be buying either of the 14"" model."
LG brand 14,LG,,9137,990 or 90N
LG brand 14,LG,,9138,You mean CA3 comes with Win 10 Home and BA3 comes with Win 10 Pro?
LG brand 14,LG,,9138,If you check online some managed to upgrade the RAM to 24GB for earlier models.
LG brand 14,LG,,9138,Is there a 24GB RAM stick?
LG brand 14,LG,,9139,8+16gb add in.
LG brand 14,LG,,9139,that additional slot is a ram or ssd one.
LG brand 14,LG,,9139,"so once you put another stick of ram in, you will not be able to slot another ssd in"
LG brand 14,LG,,9140,In store the LG brochure shows upgrade to 16gb and upgrade to 2 year warranty for all z90n models...
LG brand 14,LG,,9140,Standard provided by LG service centre
LG brand 14,LG,,9140,The major chain stores should have the brochure ba.
LG brand 14,LG,,9141,I had the impression that the additional sodimm is separate from the second m2 slot?
LG brand 14,LG,,9141,"At least for the older models, you can upgrade ram and +1 SSD."
LG brand 14,LG,,9142,"Actually, overseas 15 and 17 inch come with 16GB RAM pre-installed."
LG brand 14,LG,,9142,Don't understand why LG here wants us to bring the laptop to their service centre to upgrade.
LG brand 14,LG,,9142,Farking stupid for making us busy!!
LG brand 14,LG,,9143,So the latest model 90N only comes with 1 RAM slot and 2x SSD slots?
LG brand 14,LG,,9143,"No way to upgrade the RAM to 24GB RAM then, right?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9143,Many thanks
LG brand 14,LG,,9144,"it comes with 8gb soldered to the mobo, and one empty ram slot which the service centre will fill with 8gb ram."
LG brand 14,LG,,9144,"If I'm not wrong, there are also 2 M2 SSD slots, one of which is filled with 512gb."
LG brand 14,LG,,9144,You can get a 16gb ram to fill in the second slot instead for 24gb.
LG brand 14,LG,,9145,Is it confirmed what you said?
LG brand 14,LG,,9145,Can the laptop recognized the 24GB RAM?
LG brand 14,LG,,9145,Do you know which brand/model of power bank that can charge the LG GRAM?
LG brand 14,LG,,9146,I cannot confirm but based on those press releases search for LG gram 24gb looks like it's supported.
LG brand 14,LG,,9146,Try and see
LG brand 14,LG,,9146,lor
LG brand 14,LG,,9146,haha...
LG brand 14,LG,,9147,"all LG gram Z990 supports up to max of 24GB Ram, can run either 2400mhz or 2666mhz, on board is 2400mhz,"
LG brand 14,LG,,9147,yes 8gb is onboard
LG brand 14,LG,,9147,Z990 series supports PCIE ssd also....
LG brand 14,LG,,9147,but only i know how to enable it/
LG brand 14,LG,,9147,how it works LOL.
LG brand 14,LG,,9147,For the reason why new model does not have the $118 to upgrade to 1TB...
LG brand 14,LG,,9147,is becos Pcie SSD cost difference.
LG brand 14,LG,,9148,haha.
LG brand 14,LG,,9148,You are reaching .....
LG brand 14,LG,,9149,I just got the latest 10th Gen brochure from Challenger@Bugis a while ago
LG brand 14,LG,,9149,"Yes, RAM can be upgradeable to 24GB with 8GB default and 16GB upgradeable."
LG brand 14,LG,,9149,According to the brochure the RAM is of 3200MHz
LG brand 14,LG,,9149,It comes with 1 + 1 year pick-up warranty.
LG brand 14,LG,,9149,Need to register online for the 2nd yr warranty.
LG brand 14,LG,,9149,"Also, covers 1 yr International warranty."
LG brand 14,LG,,9149,It also states that all RAM upgrade and payment of $118 would be made at LG Svc Ctr.
LG brand 14,LG,,9149,I just checked with LG and they say the $118 is for upgrading the SSD from 512GB to 1TB
LG brand 14,LG,,9149,BTW the 17 inch uses 80Wh battery.
LG brand 14,LG,,9149,So in terms of amp-hr is how much?
LG brand 14,LG,,9149,"Anyone knows which brand/model of power bank with PD can be used eg Anker, RAVPower, Aukey etc to charge the LG Gram 17?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9149,The battery level indicated on the Gram 17 must not drop during charging and using it.
LG brand 14,LG,,9149,Must pay to upgrade to Win 10 Pro
LG brand 14,LG,,9150,45w should work.
LG brand 14,LG,,9150,65w would definitely work better?
LG brand 14,LG,,9150,the previous generation draw <45w at peak usage according to this article:
LG brand 14,LG,,9151,SSD $118 is not available for z90n...
LG brand 14,LG,,9151,i have just check with LG HQ.....
LG brand 14,LG,,9151,most of the brand powerbank as long as Power delivery is above 60w can charge.....
LG brand 14,LG,,9151,but theres is a small *
LG brand 14,LG,,9151,**.... if u want to know pls PM to ask
LG brand 14,LG,,9152,I checked with its Service Ctr and was told the $118 is for upgrading the SSD to 1TB.
LG brand 14,LG,,9152,"BTW, already pm you."
LG brand 14,LG,,9152,Maybe you can tell me the problems you faced in charging the LG Gram 17 using powerbank with PD
LG brand 14,LG,,9153,just ordered 17z90n at challenger.

LG brand 14,LG,,9155,"this new 10 gen ice lake is pretty interesting, 15w tdp i7 1065g7."
LG brand 14,LG,,9155,slightly better benchmarks according to cpubenchmark.com
LG brand 14,LG,,9155,"60% of previous gen power envelop, theres likelihood a lower wattage powerbank can still power it."
LG brand 14,LG,,9156,i7 8565u also 15w.
LG brand 14,LG,,9156,not sure how to explain why the total draw is almost 35w
LG brand 14,LG,,9156,so i attached the picture here
LG brand 14,LG,,9156,lol.
LG brand 14,LG,,9156,i guess the display suck some power also
LG brand 14,LG,,9156,bah.
LG brand 14,LG,,9157,interesting...
LG brand 14,LG,,9158,can arrange to collect same day?
LG brand 14,LG,,9158,thought the website says >2working days.
LG brand 14,LG,,9159,Thing is LG is using ddr4
LG brand 14,LG,,9159,"Vs lpddr4x ram, so power consumption on idle will be significantly higher."
LG brand 14,LG,,9159,"Also, clock speed of the ram, hopefully 3200mhz?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9159,If 2666mhz will probably impact igpu performance a fair bit.
LG brand 14,LG,,9159,Power bank can try the zmi 65w.
LG brand 14,LG,,9159,Carousell going for about 80 bucks
LG brand 14,LG,,9160,"just to inform all, challenger has to revert back the price to $2799."
LG brand 14,LG,,9160,u can even see it in their webpage which has already reflected the changes.
LG brand 14,LG,,9160,LG gram offical launch date for z90n is 9/03/2020 btw.
LG brand 14,LG,,9161,i went down to retail outlet to inquire.
LG brand 14,LG,,9161,was offered self collection in 4hrs.
LG brand 14,LG,,9161,"playing with it now, v satisfied with purchase."
LG brand 14,LG,,9161,screen size
LG brand 14,LG,,9161,really wow.
LG brand 14,LG,,9161,bigger than macbook pro 16 !!
LG brand 14,LG,,9161,yet it feels lighter than macbook pro 13.
LG brand 14,LG,,9161,i7 and decent specs
LG brand 14,LG,,9161,means its generally speedy in most tasks.
LG brand 14,LG,,9161,for users more used to windows
LG brand 14,LG,,9161,this is a good buy.
LG brand 14,LG,,9162,Heng ha you bought the one with the latest 10th Gen Intel CPU

LG brand 14,LG,,9165,Just type this in CMD:

LG brand 14,LG,,9168,wmic MEMORYCHIP get speed

LG brand 14,LG,,9170,Nice!
LG brand 14,LG,,9170,Thanks
LG brand 14,LG,,9171,Can you check whether the SSD is Samsung/Toshiba and which model?
LG brand 14,LG,,9171,Thanks
LG brand 14,LG,,9172,"from device manager, says its a samsung."
LG brand 14,LG,,9172,googled the product number
LG brand 14,LG,,9172,and i see this
LG brand 14,LG,,9173,thanks for share.
LG brand 14,LG,,9173,"for this OMARS charger, how is the charging speed?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9173,compared to the laptop's charger?
LG brand 14,LG,,9174,Haven't got my laptop yet.
LG brand 14,LG,,9174,Can you also help to check the laptop adapter's dc output amp and voltage?
LG brand 14,LG,,9174,Is it 9Vx3A or 15Vx3A?
LG brand 14,LG,,9174,Thanks
LG brand 14,LG,,9175,So it is PM981 model.
LG brand 14,LG,,9175,Thanks
LG brand 14,LG,,9176,How much did you pay for the pd charger?
LG brand 14,LG,,9176,If very expensive should have gone for the MacBook 91w charger instead
LG brand 14,LG,,9177,The price is $39.90 ValueClub memeber is $29.90
LG brand 14,LG,,9177,I'm using it to charge the powerbank only for
LG brand 14,LG,,9177,it has a 30W max input charge.
LG brand 14,LG,,9177,It is definitely insufficient to charge the LG GRAM laptop
LG brand 14,LG,,9177,Edit
LG brand 14,LG,,9177,- I thought the MacBook Pro PD charger is 96W?
LG brand 14,LG,,9178,I was informed that the battery of 72Wh inside the old 17 inch is of 9360mAh
LG brand 14,LG,,9178,"Therefore, for the latest 17 inch 80Wh battery inside the 10th Gen model it should be 10400mAh"
LG brand 14,LG,,9178,Make sure if you buy any external power bank it has sufficient capacity to charge the said laptop otherwise you'll end up charging the power bank daily instead
LG brand 14,LG,,9178,🙄
LG brand 14,LG,,9179,wah..
LG brand 14,LG,,9179,isnt it a little overkill.
LG brand 14,LG,,9179,plus a bit on the heavy side
LG brand 14,LG,,9179,im looking for a charger that charge reasonably fast and still small/light enough for everyday
LG brand 14,LG,,9180,Hi plainsman
LG brand 14,LG,,9180,Can you also help to check the laptop adapter's dc output amp and voltage?
LG brand 14,LG,,9180,Is it 9Vx3A or 15Vx3A?
LG brand 14,LG,,9180,Thanks
LG brand 14,LG,,9181,output says 19V 2.53A
LG brand 14,LG,,9182,collected this just now - bought from amazon usd399
LG brand 14,LG,,9182,will be heading down LG svc centre this week for free gifts and get this installed
LG brand 14,LG,,9183,Yeah 96W
LG brand 14,LG,,9183,my bad.
LG brand 14,LG,,9183,"Okay, $29.90 is quite a good price."
LG brand 14,LG,,9183,"For power bank, can try the ZMI 65W power bank... not as expensive as the Cygnett."
LG brand 14,LG,,9184,Based on the ZMI 65W PD 20000mAh
LG brand 14,LG,,9184,72Wh power bank specs below it won't be able to give a full charge to the 80Wh LG GRAM 17 inch 10th Gen.
LG brand 14,LG,,9184,"It is, however, cheaper and lighter"
LG brand 14,LG,,9184,Its input is limited to 45W which is better in terms of charging speed over the CYGNETT's 30W input which needs longer time to charge the larger 27000mAh battery.
LG brand 14,LG,,9184,"A power bank of 26800/27000mAh is about 99.9/100Wh, hence, can give slightly more than a full charge to the 80Wh LG GRAM 17 10th Gen"
LG brand 14,LG,,9185,For those who need a fast charge to the power bank it is best to look for power bank with 100W PD input like the Mobisun below.
LG brand 14,LG,,9185,With a 100W PD Charger you can charge it full within 1.5 hrs.
LG brand 14,LG,,9185,Or the.
LG brand 14,LG,,9185,Zendure SuperTank 100W PD 27000mAh
LG brand 14,LG,,9185,power bank
LG brand 14,LG,,9185,The weight of these 2 power banks is 500g or less.
LG brand 14,LG,,9185,Other 27000mAh
LG brand 14,LG,,9185,power banks goes into the 600+g weight
LG brand 14,LG,,9185,Note that USB-C cables for 100W 20V 5A charging input/output needs to be E-Mark.
LG brand 14,LG,,9185,E-Marking USB-C cables is explained here
LG brand 14,LG,,9186,Lg gram 202 model 80
LG brand 14,LG,,9186,wh is 10336mAh
LG brand 14,LG,,9187,Any Bro did the speedtest on the 90N wifi.
LG brand 14,LG,,9187,thanks.
LG brand 14,LG,,9188,Thanks.
LG brand 14,LG,,9188,That will be 19x2.53 = 48W into the LG GRAM 17
LG brand 14,LG,,9188,So an external battery bank of output 60W minimum is required.
LG brand 14,LG,,9189,drop wont spoil?
LG brand 14,LG,,9189,dent
LG brand 14,LG,,9189,only hahaha
LG brand 14,LG,,9189,i dropped and dented
LG brand 14,LG,,9190,alot of youtube videos showing the MIL-STD 810G durability....
LG brand 14,LG,,9190,dent wise hard to say
LG brand 14,LG,,9191,"this laptop uses wifi 6 controller, should be fast."
LG brand 14,LG,,9191,but still dependent on internet connection at home.
LG brand 14,LG,,9191,tested at 8:24pm
LG brand 14,LG,,9191,2.4ghz
LG brand 14,LG,,9191,5ghz
LG brand 14,LG,,9192,tks bro for share
LG brand 14,LG,,9192,didn't know nowadays
LG brand 14,LG,,9192,usb c charging need better quality cables.
LG brand 14,LG,,9192,will look into it and also a suitably powerful charger
LG brand 14,LG,,9193,Upcoming small size 100W and 120W PD wall chargers likely available in May
LG brand 14,LG,,9193,Aukey Omnia 100W PD Wall Charger and Dual-port PD Wall Charger
LG brand 14,LG,,9193,Galio 120W USB-C charger
LG brand 14,LG,,9193,GaN+SiC is the size of a credit card
LG brand 14,LG,,9194,Morning all !!
LG brand 14,LG,,9194,how many of you have purchased an LG Gram ?
LG brand 14,LG,,9194,shall we start an owners club ?
LG brand 14,LG,,9195,Haven't got mine yet lah
LG brand 14,LG,,9196,Harvey Norman now got discount on the laptops until 20 march.
LG brand 14,LG,,9196,Got free gift some more.
LG brand 14,LG,,9196,"Also, has anyone found out if the service centre can help your install SSD?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9197,"How much discount for i7 Gen 10 17 inch LG GRAM, huh?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9197,Are the free gifts additional to what's on the brochure?
LG brand 14,LG,,9197,Where's the link?
LG brand 14,LG,,9198,Go their website and see...
LG brand 14,LG,,9199,They never mention abt the free ram upgrade to 16gb by LG.
LG brand 14,LG,,9199,To my understanding the 8gb ram is soldered onto the mobo.
LG brand 14,LG,,9199,They will just need to add another 8gb onto the empty ram slot.
LG brand 14,LG,,9199,Also now mkt do have the 32gb DDR4 ram for both desktop and laptop.
LG brand 14,LG,,9199,moreover having 2 pcs ram of the same Gb will enable it to run on Dua.
LG brand 14,LG,,9200,HN advertised the older LG GRAM 17z990 model not the latest 10th Gen model
LG brand 14,LG,,9201,"no , HN already post the latest 90N"
LG brand 14,LG,,9202,Here you go...
LG brand 14,LG,,9202,See the red text got extra discount
LG brand 14,LG,,9203,Thank you.
LG brand 14,LG,,9203,👌
LG brand 14,LG,,9204,the harvey norman is a better offer than mine.
LG brand 14,LG,,9204,extra $130 off 2799.
LG brand 14,LG,,9204,"plus quite alot of free gifts from them 1tb ext hdd, wireless mouse"
LG brand 14,LG,,9204,etc
LG brand 14,LG,,9204,"i believe the standard.free gifts for z90n - 8gb ram upgrade, carrying case, anti virus still applies ?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9205,I think so cos this one offered by LG.
LG brand 14,LG,,9205,"Ask you ah, did you manage to visit the service centre?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9205,Can they help to install the SSD?
LG brand 14,LG,,9206,I'm getting my set now.
LG brand 14,LG,,9206,Later I'll pop into the service centre and ask them to install an additional ssd for me
LG brand 14,LG,,9206,Edit - LG Service Ctr installed the SSD I bought
LG brand 14,LG,,9207,For the 17 inch 10th Gen model ALL the USB 3.1 ports are of Gen 2 type ie at 10Gbps transfer speed.
LG brand 14,LG,,9207,This was just informed to me by LG
LG brand 14,LG,,9208,Thanks and enjoy your new gadget.
LG brand 14,LG,,9208,"Hope my service was good haha ^^"""
LG brand 14,LG,,9209,Thank you for your great service
LG brand 14,LG,,9209,👍😁
LG brand 14,LG,,9210,Wow.
LG brand 14,LG,,9210,Any idea about the 14 inch?
LG brand 14,LG,,9210,I have a NVMe external SSD.
LG brand 14,LG,,9210,Hoping can have gen 2 speeds
LG brand 14,LG,,9211,He sold you or he is from service centre?
LG brand 14,LG,,9211,Haha
LG brand 14,LG,,9212,You check with @destiny88 lor.
LG brand 14,LG,,9212,😁
LG brand 14,LG,,9213,All new z90n comes with gen 2 usb type a port
LG brand 14,LG,,9214,/edited
LG brand 14,LG,,9214,kudos to LG service staff ...
LG brand 14,LG,,9214,"good job !,!"
LG brand 14,LG,,9214,"at first, the staff told me that installation of extra ssd that separately purchased for latest 2020 z90n series is additional $85.60 incl gst"
LG brand 14,LG,,9214,"however, later the staff helped to check and says the 2020 z90n series come with free additional 8gb ram."
LG brand 14,LG,,9214,"if u ask them to help install the ssd together with the free 8gb ram, there will be no extra charge."
LG brand 14,LG,,9214,which makes sense anyways.
LG brand 14,LG,,9214,you need to separately buy your own nvme ssd.
LG brand 14,LG,,9214,"i checked fuwell prices and while they are reasonable, it is far cheaper to order via amazon."
LG brand 14,LG,,9214,samsung 970 evo plus   fuwell sells 1tb at 639
LG brand 14,LG,,9214,i got 2tb from amazon
LG brand 14,LG,,9214,about 600
LG brand 14,LG,,9214,+.
LG brand 14,LG,,9214,if u plan to use this laptop for productivity for 3 years or longer
LG brand 14,LG,,9214,"warranty cover 2 years, should consider one time have ample storage."
LG brand 14,LG,,9215,Thanks!
LG brand 14,LG,,9215,Do you know if the hdmi version is 1.4 or 2.0?
LG brand 14,LG,,9215,1.4 cannot output 4k@60hz in RGB...
LG brand 14,LG,,9215,Still undecided on the LG gram 14.
LG brand 14,LG,,9215,"Build quality seems bad, design a bit dated and the screen seems to have uneven colours I notice on most display sets, the centre of the screen is warmer than the sides."
LG brand 14,LG,,9215,But its so upgradable and port selection is good.
LG brand 14,LG,,9215,Anyone done any benchmarks on the 14 inch version yet?
LG brand 14,LG,,9215,Heard there were some throttling issues on previous version..
LG brand 14,LG,,9215,not sure if it still happens.
LG brand 14,LG,,9216,Can the ram be upgraded?
LG brand 14,LG,,9216,"If so, whats the max amount of Ram?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9217,LG official recommendation is 24GB RAM.
LG brand 14,LG,,9217,Anything more than that may or may not cause issues.
LG brand 14,LG,,9217,I heard so far someone upgraded to 40GB RAM.
LG brand 14,LG,,9218,1.4.
LG brand 14,LG,,9218,u want run 4k 60hz go usb c/thunderbolt.
LG brand 14,LG,,9218,New model has better thermal then old model.
LG brand 14,LG,,9219,Edit Reason - Mixed up default and installed RAMs
LG brand 14,LG,,9219,I have checked the DDR4 RAM speeds.
LG brand 14,LG,,9219,The default 8GB RAM is 3200MHz.
LG brand 14,LG,,9219,The installed 8GB RAM speed is 2667MHz .
LG brand 14,LG,,9219,See attached photos.
LG brand 14,LG,,9219,Bank 0 installed 8GB RAM Speed 2667.
LG brand 14,LG,,9219,Bank 2 default 8GB RAM Speed 3200
LG brand 14,LG,,9220,"those of you who purchased the laptop, have you registered your laptop warranty on LG website?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9220,"a minor feedback i had for the staff was, previously when i registered my product a LG smartphone i could see warranty was 24 months for parts and labour"
LG brand 14,LG,,9220,"but for this laptop, i can't see the number of months."
LG brand 14,LG,,9220,the staff do not have feedback for me
LG brand 14,LG,,9221,Is it the other way round e.g. Bank 2 is the default?
LG brand 14,LG,,9221,Previously I thought when plainsman ran the test it showed 3200.
LG brand 14,LG,,9222,Can ask him to show the test results?
LG brand 14,LG,,9222,Either case if the default RAM is 3200MHz then LG has installed for us a 2667MHz RAM then.
LG brand 14,LG,,9222,I used HWINFO64
LG brand 14,LG,,9222,and CPUZx64
LG brand 14,LG,,9222,and they also showed 2667MHz only
LG brand 14,LG,,9223,thanks bros for helpful info here
LG brand 14,LG,,9223,now when i do the get speed i get
LG brand 14,LG,,9223,speed.
LG brand 14,LG,,9223,2400.
LG brand 14,LG,,9223,3200
LG brand 14,LG,,9223,i feel cheated !!
LG brand 14,LG,,9223,the free 8gb is only 2400 speed
LG brand 14,LG,,9224,When I ran the wmic MEMORYCHIP get speed it showed
LG brand 14,LG,,9224,Speed
LG brand 14,LG,,9224,2667
LG brand 14,LG,,9224,3200
LG brand 14,LG,,9224,It means the default RAM is 3200MHz whereas the installed RAM is of 2667MHz
LG brand 14,LG,,9224,See my previous attachments
LG brand 14,LG,,9224,Note :
LG brand 14,LG,,9224,- LG rep just confirmed the default RAM is of 3200MHz.
LG brand 14,LG,,9224,He'll escalate to his HQ for an answer and reply back
LG brand 14,LG,,9225,When I was at LG Svc Ctr and asked them about the 2nd 12 months registration the staff said no need to register
LG brand 14,LG,,9226,tks pls keep us posted.
LG brand 14,LG,,9227,Latest news.
LG brand 14,LG,,9227,According to LG they are now working something out on this issue
LG brand 14,LG,,9227,Meantime just use it first
LG brand 14,LG,,9228,Thank.
LG brand 14,LG,,9228,Does the 990 series have the same issue too.
LG brand 14,LG,,9229,Don't know.
LG brand 14,LG,,9229,You'll need to check the speed of the soldered RAM if any and then compare its speed to the installed RAM
LG brand 14,LG,,9230,"While the LG gram 17 slightly surpasses it in most respects, the LG gram 14 2-in-1 is nevertheless a superb device that comes with a touch screen and an included digital pen."
LG brand 14,LG,,9230,So try
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,My short review in using the ZENDURE Supertank 27000mah
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,100WH power bank with PD 100W
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,to charge the LG GRAM
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,17 10th
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,Gen with 80 WH battery.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,I use the APPLE 96W USB-C ac charger for charging the ZENDURE Supertank power bank.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,Internet review of the ZENDURE Supertank 27000mah
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,power bank with specs as below.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,Video reviews here
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,"Firstly, charging the laptop."
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,With the laptop at 16% battery level I'm able to use the power bank to charge it to 100%.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,The power bank indication is at 1%.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,This is done either with the laptop totally power off or its lid closed with
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,BT/Wifi/Kb light turned off.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,With my previous CYGNETT 27000mah
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,100W PD power bank I can only achieved 80% of the laptop battery level before it stops charging with one blinking light still on the power bank.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,Full charge of the laptop takes about 2 hrs
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,"Secondly, charging the ZENDURE Supertank power bank."
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,I'm using the APPLE 96W USB-C ac charger to charge the power bank with the default cable that comes with the power bank.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,The time it took was 2hrs 20min from 1 to 100%.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,According to YouTube reviews if you use the ZENDURE SuperPort 4 100W USB-C desktop charger you should be able to full charge the Supertank power bank within 1 hr????.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,The reviews are incorrect regarding the charging time.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,Actual charging revealed about 1hr 45 min for a full charge.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,What I Like
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,1 Lighter weight at 500gm.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,"Generally, most 27000mah power banks go into the 600"
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,+
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,gm weight
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,2 Has pass-through charging which many similar power banks lack.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,3
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,Has a feature to allow the charging of low power devices like smartwatches/wrist bands/ear buds/ear phones
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,What I Don't Like. 1
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,Pretty thick.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,If designed flatter like others would be more portable.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,2 Not sure the default power bank charging cable's compatiblility with the APPLE 96W USB-C ac charger.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,Might have to search for another PD 100W20V/5A charging cable to shorten the charging time.
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,Only way out now for fast charging the Supertank is to use the ZENDURE SuperPort 4 100W USB-C desktop charger
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,"Notes
1"
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,Can get the ZENDURE Supertank power bank from Shopee or from a shop CaseFactorie in Bugis Street
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,2
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,"Unfortunately, the ZENDURE SuperPort 4 100W USB-C desktop charger is not available now at the Bugis Street shop but can get from Shopee."
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,3
LG brand 14,LG,,9231,The APPLE 96W USB-C ac charger does NOT come with a USB-C charging cable so selecting a compatible cable is crucial for fast charging
LG brand 14,LG,,9232,Was informed that the battery bank is unable to charge the laptop when the laptop battery level drops below 15%.
LG brand 14,LG,,9232,Needs to use direct charging from an ac charger
LG brand 14,LG,,9232,Does this apply to USBC charger also?
LG brand 14,LG,,9232,Or only power bank cannot?
LG brand 14,LG,,9233,"yes, 10chars"
LG brand 14,LG,,9234,Yes to which?
LG brand 14,LG,,9234,All USBC charger?
LG brand 14,LG,,9234,Or only affects power bank?
LG brand 14,LG,,9235,@destiny88
LG brand 14,LG,,9235,I tried charging the 17 inch GRAM at 14% battery level with the Zendure Supertank power bank and it works.
LG brand 14,LG,,9235,Did not try anything lower than that
LG brand 14,LG,,9235,I have revised my review
LG brand 14,LG,,9235,BTW does the 17 inch 10th
LG brand 14,LG,,9235,Gen model supports WPA3?
LG brand 14,LG,,9236,haha
LG brand 14,LG,,9236,like i said cant remember 10% or 15%
LG brand 14,LG,,9236,cannot charge already.forgotten which.
LG brand 14,LG,,9236,seems like its below 10% cannot use usb c to charge.
LG brand 14,LG,,9236,Nice powerbank.
LG brand 14,LG,,9236,sorry the one i introduce you not able to work as intended
LG brand 14,LG,,9236,"hows the 17"" new 10gen gram working out?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9237,The LG GRAM 17 10th
LG brand 14,LG,,9237,Gen is great for productivity work.
LG brand 14,LG,,9237,But now I realized it uses about 40% of my RAM when surfing the net and watching Youtube via Invidio.us.
LG brand 14,LG,,9237,Need to increase the RAM to 24GB ah
LG brand 14,LG,,9238,RAM is meant to be used...
LG brand 14,LG,,9238,haha.
LG brand 14,LG,,9238,Does the Apple USB-C charger able to charge when battery below 10%?
LG brand 14,LG,,9239,Regarding the APPLE 96W USB-C charger I'll need to test again.
LG brand 14,LG,,9239,Will feedback here after my testing
LG brand 14,LG,,9240,"Hi,
can u confirm that the 2020 LG 17"" comes with DDR4 3200 ram?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9240,I'm thinking of buying  base model and them upgrade with a stick of 16G DDR myself.
LG brand 14,LG,,9240,"H/w, seems that DDR4 3200 sodimm isn't readily available in SLS or online stores..."
LG brand 14,LG,,9240,There's many DDR4 2666 though.
LG brand 14,LG,,9241,"Yes, the pre-installed RAM is of 8GB DDR4 3200MHz according to LG."
LG brand 14,LG,,9241,ADATA has it
LG brand 14,LG,,9241,but not sure whether it's available here.
LG brand 14,LG,,9241,I'm also thinking of increasing my RAM to 24GB because currently I can hit 40% of memory usage running Firefox browser and watching clips on FreeTube alone
LG brand 14,LG,,9242,It's confirmed that the ZENDURE Supertank power bank can charge the new LG GRAM 17 with a battery level at 8%.
LG brand 14,LG,,9242,When charging the laptop from 8% battery level I can only achieved 89% charge when the power bank reached 1%.
LG brand 14,LG,,9242,Did not test anything lower than that.
LG brand 14,LG,,9242,See attached pictures
LG brand 14,LG,,9242,"Sorry, did not read your post clearly."
LG brand 14,LG,,9242,Will test using the APPLE USB-C another day with less than 10% laptop battery level
LG brand 14,LG,,9243,Currently 3200mhz ram is not yet available in sg.
LG brand 14,LG,,9243,Most likely next month.prices wise will update here.
LG brand 14,LG,,9243,Wow 8% can charge.
LG brand 14,LG,,9243,This power bank is the best i have seen for typce c atm.
LG brand 14,LG,,9243,Legit surprised
LG brand 14,LG,,9244,Ok thank you very much
LG brand 14,LG,,9245,Quote from above link
LG brand 14,LG,,9245,"On FireStrike, the 15W i7-1065G7 featuring Intels Iris Plus G7 iGPU"
LG brand 14,LG,,9245,still trails the Ryzen 5 4650U by roughly 10 percent.
LG brand 14,LG,,9245,Unquote
LG brand 14,LG,,9245,"Look, 10% is unnoticeable lah."
LG brand 14,LG,,9245,😁
LG brand 14,LG,,9246,Ok to answer your question properly.
LG brand 14,LG,,9246,The APPLE USB-C charger is able to charge the new LG GRAM 17 at 9% battery level.
LG brand 14,LG,,9246,See attached pictures
LG brand 14,LG,,9247,Thanks man

LG brand 14,LG,,9247,Might just be returning it for the LG gram 14 instead...
LG brand 14,LG,,9248,"Woow, they allow to change from Dell brand to Lg ."
LG brand 14,LG,,9248,As XPS 13 is from Dell ?

LG brand 14,LG,,9250,is USB c to ethernet adaptor the only Answer?
LG brand 14,LG,,9251,Just bought the 90N at J.point on 5/4/2020.
LG brand 14,LG,,9251,Going LG service centre tmr to do the Ram upgrade and free gifts
LG brand 14,LG,,9252,"Hi, could u share how much did u pay for it?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9252,shop name?
LG brand 14,LG,,9253,went to service centre to do the 8gb ram upgrade.
LG brand 14,LG,,9253,chk is 3200Mhz speed.
LG brand 14,LG,,9253,I intended to upgrade another 512 Gb storage by the centre  but was quote near to $300.
LG brand 14,LG,,9253,They using the samsung higher end type.
LG brand 14,LG,,9253,Was also told by the service centre and technician the 2 year wnty will be void if I open the base to do the ram and storage.
LG brand 14,LG,,9254,I also discovered that we need to tweak the wifi setting on the laptop to get good connection and speed.
LG brand 14,LG,,9255,Tweak what settings?
LG brand 14,LG,,9255,Please share
LG brand 14,LG,,9255,Thanks
LG brand 14,LG,,9256,Guys got good lobang about this laptop please share.
LG brand 14,LG,,9257,is the LG Gram screen's glossiness an issue for anyone?
LG brand 14,LG,,9258,i am wondering if I can use a USB-C PD wall charger not power bank for the LG Gram.
LG brand 14,LG,,9258,"If yes, any wall charger proven can work?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9258,Some people experienced CPU throttling when using USB-C PD wall charger.
LG brand 14,LG,,9259,is the computer slowing down a lot when using Apple USB-C charger?
LG brand 14,LG,,9260,Just sit with your back facing a wall can leow
LG brand 14,LG,,9261,I'm using the.
LG brand 14,LG,,9261,Apple USB-C charger to charge the power bank at home only.
LG brand 14,LG,,9261,It is inconvenient for outdoor use for it's larger and heavier than the original LG AC adapter
LG brand 14,LG,,9262,"My daughter told me when she used the original  adapter during battery charging she can feel ""ant biting"" when her skin touch the laptop."
LG brand 14,LG,,9262,Her body is grounded to the floor.
LG brand 14,LG,,9262,Thus I use a electrical test pen to touch the metal part of the laptop.
LG brand 14,LG,,9262,The test pen lit up.
LG brand 14,LG,,9262,"Although the light is very dim , this show current leakage."
LG brand 14,LG,,9262,I did a google check for answer
LG brand 14,LG,,9262,and it was told to be normal for some low end bad filtering adaptor.
LG brand 14,LG,,9262,This can be rectified  by using a 3 pins cord with earthling.
LG brand 14,LG,,9262,Can any brother try it to confirm that they are also having the same too?
LG brand 14,LG,,9263,thanks for share.
LG brand 14,LG,,9263,"i dont feel 'ants bite' since day one, using only the LG power charger that came with laptop."
LG brand 14,LG,,9263,i bought 17 inch version
LG brand 14,LG,,9263,"but, the free RAM upgrade they gave me only 2400mhz."
LG brand 14,LG,,9263,will need head down svc centre ask for change to the correct RAM speed promised.
LG brand 14,LG,,9263,Does anyone know if LG service centre still open during Circuit Breaker?
LG brand 14,LG,,9264,thats a problem with low quality adapter.
LG brand 14,LG,,9264,metal lenovo has this issue too.
LG brand 14,LG,,9264,But hp elitebook which is fully metal doesnt have
LG brand 14,LG,,9265,"if that is the case, then mostly is the adaptor problem."
LG brand 14,LG,,9265,will call up LG .
LG brand 14,LG,,9265,"As forthe ram speed ,I got the 3200 from the LG upgrade."
LG brand 14,LG,,9266,Call them.
LG brand 14,LG,,9266,Maybe by appointment only.
LG brand 14,LG,,9266,I ordered a 16GB RAM 3200MHz from LG leow.
LG brand 14,LG,,9266,Will arrive in May due to this cov19
LG brand 14,LG,,9267,Is the LG power adapter 3 pin?
LG brand 14,LG,,9267,All 2 pin adapters will have this problem.
LG brand 14,LG,,9267,"Experienced it on dell, Lenovo, hp and Microsoft surface when charging thru USB-C using a 2 pin adapter."
LG brand 14,LG,,9267,No issues if you use a 3pinnmetal plug though
LG brand 14,LG,,9268,If anybody interested in LG Gram
LG brand 14,LG,,9268,17inch 2020 @$2699
LG brand 14,LG,,9268,with freebie office 365pro and wireless mouse please pm me !
LG brand 14,LG,,9268,Outdated offer.
LG brand 14,LG,,9268,Gotten a better offer @ $2600 without freebies ..
LG brand 14,LG,,9268,is that the best deal ?
LG brand 14,LG,,9269,Why selling your set off?
LG brand 14,LG,,9269,Any reason?
LG brand 14,LG,,9269,Or you are a salesman?
LG brand 14,LG,,9270,"it is using the normal 3pin wall socket type, but the other end to the power adaptor is a 2 pin type."
LG brand 14,LG,,9270,"Meaning no ""earth wire""."
LG brand 14,LG,,9270,most 2 pin have this problem but not all.
LG brand 14,LG,,9270,If the power adaptor have a built in filter this will not happen.
LG brand 14,LG,,9270,We need electrical or electronic knowledge on this.
LG brand 14,LG,,9271,Nope.
LG brand 14,LG,,9271,I am just sharing this deal !
LG brand 14,LG,,9271,I am considering among various laptops as well
LG brand 14,LG,,9271,.. came across a Microsoft surface pro 7 i7/16gb/512gb matte black @ $2198 on courts few days back
LG brand 14,LG,,9271,but didnt pull the trigger...
LG brand 14,LG,,9271,now it is out of stock..
LG brand 14,LG,,9271,therefore looking for alternative right now and LG gram 17 is one of the candidates.
LG brand 14,LG,,9272,Got try flipping the two pins on the power adapter to the other way round?
LG brand 14,LG,,9272,It is said to help on Microsoft surface devices
LG brand 14,LG,,9273,woww.
LG brand 14,LG,,9273,you also know yea.
LG brand 14,LG,,9273,But this round it does not work.
LG brand 14,LG,,9273,Using another good qty  power adaptor with the same DC voltage solved  the leakage problem.
LG brand 14,LG,,9273,Will call up LG service on this matter.
LG brand 14,LG,,9274,How to fix it.
LG brand 14,LG,,9274,Get a three prong power adapter:
LG brand 14,LG,,9274,"Just like your socket, some AC adaptors are also earthed which is the purpose of the third prong."
LG brand 14,LG,,9274,This provides an extra layer of protection by taking out any rogue current that might end up shocking you or doing damage.
LG brand 14,LG,,9275,"yes, LG should have done it, since the set cost more than 2 K"
LG brand 14,LG,,9276,"office 365 offically dont have ""pro"" version, only home and personal,"
LG brand 14,LG,,9276,$2699 not cheap
LG brand 14,LG,,9276,la.
LG brand 14,LG,,9276,i know those who gotten it cheaper
LG brand 14,LG,,9276,lol.
LG brand 14,LG,,9277,"If its brand new,"
LG brand 14,LG,,9277,"That was the deal i got , 2699 , from challenger."
LG brand 14,LG,,9277,But seems the salesman sold it and later company says cannot sell anymore.
LG brand 14,LG,,9278,like that very restrictive movement
LG brand 14,LG,,9279,Better that way especially in public places so nobody can see what you are doing over your back
LG brand 14,LG,,9279,😁
LG brand 14,LG,,9280,Btw apple USBC charger is it 3 pin?
LG brand 14,LG,,9280,Won't cause the electric shock hor?
LG brand 14,LG,,9281,$2600 - LG gram 2020 i7 version good deal to buy?
LG brand 14,LG,,9282,I just got a LG Gram 17.
LG brand 14,LG,,9282,"I found when I am typing, my right palm keep pressing and sometimes clicking the touch pad."
LG brand 14,LG,,9282,This caused some issues.
LG brand 14,LG,,9282,How do you guys handle this?
LG brand 14,LG,,9282,Sent from HUAWEI LYA-L29 using GAGT
LG brand 14,LG,,9283,So far the only way is to turn off touch pad.
LG brand 14,LG,,9283,Luckily it can be done easily using a function key.
LG brand 14,LG,,9283,Sent from HUAWEI LYA-L29 using GAGT
LG brand 14,LG,,9284,if have touchpad software install it.
LG brand 14,LG,,9284,Got palm rejection setting
LG brand 14,LG,,9285,Yes.
LG brand 14,LG,,9285,Touching doesn't cause issue but sometimes the touching clicks the toupad pad
LG brand 14,LG,,9285,so it becomes right click.
LG brand 14,LG,,9285,That causes issue.
LG brand 14,LG,,9285,Sent from HUAWEI LYA-L29 using GAGT
LG brand 14,LG,,9286,"Hi ,"
LG brand 14,LG,,9286,Anyone know of any good deal to get this model?
LG brand 14,LG,,9286,Should I get it from Best online?
LG brand 14,LG,,9286,I understand that the free gifts of 16mb etc will need to collect from LG directly.
LG brand 14,LG,,9286,Any better deal that Best could offer?
LG brand 14,LG,,9287,Best Denki website got $90 off $1600
LG brand 14,LG,,9287,"purchased, Free upgrade to 16GB Ram, Sleeve case, Anti-virus for 1 year and 2nd year"
LG brand 14,LG,,9287,warranty.[Terms and condition apply*]

LG brand 14,LG,,9287,"Anyone looking for LG Gram can talk to me via PM, a few fellow forumers have purchased from me and is happy with my service and their purchase."
LG brand 14,LG,,9288,Harvey Norman giving like 150 off though if you add to cart...
LG brand 14,LG,,9289,"but they not giving away ms officelife time useage, Free upgrade to 16GB Ram, Sleeve case, Anti-virus for 1 year and 2nd year warranty."
LG brand 14,LG,,9289,", that will cost you $200, so which deal is better?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9289,clear choice ah
LG brand 14,LG,,9290,I think it's clear someone is about to get banned for advertising.
LG brand 14,LG,,9291,"i dint say buy from me, best denki is also advertised by HWZ, so quoting HWZ is gonna get me banned then"
LG brand 14,LG,,9291,so be it.
LG brand 14,LG,,9291,"i dont own best denki, i dont own HWZ."
LG brand 14,LG,,9291,dont see any issues with just stating what u getting with the purchase.
LG brand 14,LG,,9291,Lobang SIC.
LG brand 14,LG,,9291,also i dint put any links to suggested retailer.
LG brand 14,LG,,9291,no affiliation link either.
LG brand 14,LG,,9292,I see.
LG brand 14,LG,,9292,Thought the free upgrades is provided by LG?
LG brand 14,LG,,9292,Or that promo is over?
LG brand 14,LG,,9292,Haha
LG brand 14,LG,,9292,Btw I realise when you add to cart in best denki website you get 100 off automatically.
LG brand 14,LG,,9292,So means 160 off with free upgrade to 16gb if buy from best denki?
LG brand 14,LG,,9292,If so then it's a good deal.
LG brand 14,LG,,9293,"i believe the discount does not stack, so which ever is higher."
LG brand 14,LG,,9294,Sure anot?
LG brand 14,LG,,9295,I just checked Best Denki's website.
LG brand 14,LG,,9295,The coupon code is stackable.
LG brand 14,LG,,9295,And it's also $90 off instead of $60 off with the coupon code BEST90.
LG brand 14,LG,,9295,"For the 14Z90N with i7-1065G7 configuration, the total price is $2,106, which is cheaper than Harvey Norman."
LG brand 14,LG,,9295,I also went on LG's website and checked the promo.
LG brand 14,LG,,9295,"The 16GB RAM upgrade, antivirus, free sleeve and extended warranty is provided by LG themselves and is available for purchases up to 31 May, and redemption period until 30th June."
LG brand 14,LG,,9295,See for yourself here:
LG brand 14,LG,,9295,It seems like it should be available as long as you buy from an authorised retailer.
LG brand 14,LG,,9295,"So you can buy from Challenger, harvey norman etc as well."
LG brand 14,LG,,9295,"As for the free Office licence, I have no comments."
LG brand 14,LG,,9295,"For me, I get an Office 365 subscription and share it with my family members, so my yearly cost comes up to only $30/year or less."
LG brand 14,LG,,9295,"If you do a quick Google search, a 1-user licence of Office 2019 Professional is available quite cheaply as well though not sure how legit"
LG brand 14,LG,,9296,so u mean buying from BESK DENKI ONLINE
LG brand 14,LG,,9296,now i get comm?
LG brand 14,LG,,9296,u have no idea how retail works.
LG brand 14,LG,,9297,"np, just saying whats available ^^"
LG brand 14,LG,,9298,"Sure, no worries."
LG brand 14,LG,,9298,Good to see this level of interest on this laptop
LG brand 14,LG,,9299,"This is you saying buy from me, not buy from Best Denki."
LG brand 14,LG,,9299,Don't buat bodoh lah.
LG brand 14,LG,,9299,"People come to this forum to get opinions about tech stuff that isn't from salesmen in a store trying to sell wtv they have in stock, not to get opinions from salesmen masquerading as members."
LG brand 14,LG,,9300,"FYI, I bought the LG GRAM 17 2020 from destiny88"
LG brand 14,LG,,9301,Oh so he is a salesman after all.
LG brand 14,LG,,9302,No regret buying from him lah.
LG brand 14,LG,,9302,Can get some extras as well
LG brand 14,LG,,9302,😁
LG brand 14,LG,,9303,I'm sure it is.
LG brand 14,LG,,9303,"My concern is the problem of ethics, that he may be pushing this model in a non-objective manner in order to promote sales of his product."
LG brand 14,LG,,9303,"Especially when he's actively denying he is a salesman despite you showing otherwise, already tells me he's not very ethical, or why would he be denying it?."
LG brand 14,LG,,9304,No difference lah.
LG brand 14,LG,,9304,Buy from him or from the shop
LG brand 14,LG,,9304,what's the difference?
LG brand 14,LG,,9304,"Can get a good price with freebies and good support are what you want mah, no?
😁"
LG brand 14,LG,,9305,This is one of the very few places to get tech advice on local deals without an annoying salesman trying to push his wares.
LG brand 14,LG,,9305,"If the salesmen all come in and start pretending to be members, what's the difference between here and a store?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9305,We will no longer be able to get objective opinions from real users because they'll all be salesmen pretending to be users.
LG brand 14,LG,,9305,"Good deals are important, but getting objective information to make a purchase that satisfies your needs is even more important."
LG brand 14,LG,,9306,I don't find he's pushy mah.
LG brand 14,LG,,9306,"I did my homework, clarified some issues with him and then made my buy decision"
LG brand 14,LG,,9306,😁
LG brand 14,LG,,9307,"I wasn't saying he is pushy, I was saying in shops they are pushy, and this is one of the few places where there aren't pushy salesmen."
LG brand 14,LG,,9307,"There are people who are not as knowledgeable in tech as us, and they may be swayed by people pretending to be members and end up spending far more than they need to, or end up buying a product that doesn't fit their needs because somebody wanted to earn commission."
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,1st.
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,I dint deny im a salesman
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,", im saying u buying online"
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,i dont get comm.
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,2nd.
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,"This is a LG gram thread, if u not considering this model u come in here"
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,i also dont know what u come in for.
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,3rd.
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,"This is a forum, everyone and anyone can be a member and come comment and post things what-so-ever, u have issues with a post?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,report lor.
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,u not the admin
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,also what.
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,"4th, People ask question i reply them what they wanna know, this is information for their purchase decision, u got the power to sway them to buy another model then do so, i wont flame nor report as everyone makes their own decision."
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,5th.
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,share lobang for them
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,and maybe i get something back in return
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,", win-win nothing wrong with that"

LG brand 14,LG,,9308,6th.
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,u come here
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,want bring this thing off topic is like what a competitor brand salesman would do.
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,"but i doubt u are 1, but no need bring this off topic again."
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,any issues
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,u not happy u can go shove it somewhere else.
LG brand 14,LG,,9308,i wont bother replying what u trying to stir also le
LG brand 14,LG,,9309,"That's right, finally show your true colours."
LG brand 14,LG,,9309,Now everyone in this thread including your potential customers knows what kind of person you are and what kind of attitude they can expect when something goes wrong with their purchase.
LG brand 14,LG,,9309,You've managed to do more to ruin your own reputation than anyone else could.
LG brand 14,LG,,9309,Well done.
LG brand 14,LG,,9310,I think you have assessed him wrongly.
LG brand 14,LG,,9310,He's a LG salesman and he has given a great service.
LG brand 14,LG,,9310,If you go to the store you'll see him there.
LG brand 14,LG,,9310,What's the difference buying from him here and there?
LG brand 14,LG,,9310,Are you saying if you go to any store you'll definitely get great service from the salesman there?
LG brand 14,LG,,9310,You should know that if after a purchase any issue that arises out of the product you are supposed to go to the service centre and not the salesman?
LG brand 14,LG,,9311,"dont have to reply him, i believe you are the best person who knows what kind of service"
LG brand 14,LG,,9311,/follow up
LG brand 14,LG,,9311,i do for my customer
LG brand 14,LG,,9311,", this guy 100% is coming to this thread to stir something, lets just leave him alone."
LG brand 14,LG,,9311,he is either a salesman himself who lost sales here to me or hes another brand promoter whos trying to get this thread close down.
LG brand 14,LG,,9311,best thing is we just ignore him.
LG brand 14,LG,,9311,i already block and report already
LG brand 14,LG,,9312,"Okay, back to the main topic at hand..."
LG brand 14,LG,,9312,Notebookcheck just did a quick review of the LG 14Z90N here:
LG brand 14,LG,,9312,"Seems like performance is below average for an Ice Lake CPU, but I guess that is to be expected given the size and weight."
LG brand 14,LG,,9312,Battery life is impressively long at 14 hours.
LG brand 14,LG,,9313,Why its RAM used is DDR4-1866?
LG brand 14,LG,,9313,I thought the RAM sold here uses the DDR4 3200 MHz?
LG brand 14,LG,,9313,My LG GRAM 17 is getting DDR4-3200 MHz
LG brand 14,LG,,9313,leh
LG brand 14,LG,,9314,Good eye.
LG brand 14,LG,,9314,Maybe a typo
LG brand 14,LG,,9314,but i guess that could be a factor if really the case
LG brand 14,LG,,9315,I have been using LG Gram 14 2017 coming to 3 years already.
LG brand 14,LG,,9315,Battery capacity has dropped about 16% and find it a bit slow
LG brand 14,LG,,9315,cuz it's a dual-core processor.
LG brand 14,LG,,9315,"Other than that, do not have any issues with it."
LG brand 14,LG,,9315,"Love the screen, weight, and battery life maybe not so much now cuz it has degraded a bit"
LG brand 14,LG,,9316,100% a typo
LG brand 14,LG,,9316,la haha
LG brand 14,LG,,9316,",DDR4 dont have that kind of speed one hahaha"
LG brand 14,LG,,9317,planning a upgrading anytime soon?
LG brand 14,LG,,9318,waiting for it to spoil or LG to release gram with front-facing speakers
LG brand 14,LG,,9319,Unless LG does away with the num pad like the New DELL XPS 15/17.....
LG brand 14,LG,,9319,Taking some cues from the new XPS 17 LG could
LG brand 14,LG,,9319,1 have front facing speakers by re-designing the keyboard.
LG brand 14,LG,,9319,2
LG brand 14,LG,,9319,have 4x USB-C 4.0/TB4 ports and PCIe 4.0 all these come with Tiger Lake cpu
LG brand 14,LG,,9319,3 new Tiger Lake CPU with dGPU
LG brand 14,LG,,9319,4 larger 97WHr battery
LG brand 14,LG,,9319,5 lower the screen to make the bottom bezel thinner
LG brand 14,LG,,9319,and so has a smaller form factor.
LG brand 14,LG,,9319,Forget about the LG logo there
LG brand 14,LG,,9319,"lah

LG brand 14,LG,,9326,Please share tks
LG brand 14,LG,,9327,Super light weight with long battery life as a productivity machine.
LG brand 14,LG,,9327,If you get the 17 inch
LG brand 14,LG,,9327,I bet you'll never go back to anything smaller than that in future....
LG brand 14,LG,,9327,not for me at least
LG brand 14,LG,,9328,"after 2.5 months with this, delivered quite fair bit of work ,including producting videos."
LG brand 14,LG,,9328,alot of photoshop.
LG brand 14,LG,,9328,everything runs ok.
LG brand 14,LG,,9328,day to day productivity is smooth and quite fast.
LG brand 14,LG,,9328,am taking wifi 6 for granted.
LG brand 14,LG,,9328,"shocker, the lan dongle that comes with it only support up to 100mbps!"
LG brand 14,LG,,9328,these days its no longer enuf as surfing speeds of 300-500mbps
LG brand 14,LG,,9328,are noticeable and feels alot more smoother.
LG brand 14,LG,,9328,"video editing wise, machine slows and stutters once u have 2-3 full hd footages in same frame concurrently."
LG brand 14,LG,,9328,single frame with text and occasional simple efx and audio still smooth.
LG brand 14,LG,,9328,overall am definitely happy with this machine.
LG brand 14,LG,,9328,"only gian is i see all the new games coming out, wonder if i shld hv got an aftershock instead."
LG brand 14,LG,,9328,much heavier
LG brand 14,LG,,9328,"i suppose but 1.9kg, much faster graphics."
LG brand 14,LG,,9328,guess u cant have everything...
LG brand 14,LG,,9329,It's more of a productivity machine.
LG brand 14,LG,,9329,Still not powerful enough for video editing and games like stuff.
LG brand 14,LG,,9329,Before you buy you should watch Youtube and read net reviews mah.
LG brand 14,LG,,9329,You can also connect a TB3 cable to its USB-C/TB3 port and hook up externally to an eGPU and monitor at home to play games mah
LG brand 14,LG,,9330,v happy with the gram overall lah.
LG brand 14,LG,,9330,just trying to push the limits of machine
LG brand 14,LG,,9330,"my previous video editing laptop was a 2016 macbook 12"" with 8gb ram"
LG brand 14,LG,,9330,but i upgraded to m7 cpu.
LG brand 14,LG,,9330,churned many videos with it.
LG brand 14,LG,,9330,this gram 17 with 10 gen i7 and iris plus definitely much faster.
LG brand 14,LG,,9330,"on side note, all the ps2 , sega saturn emulators by now run super nice on this"
LG brand 14,LG,,9331,"As mentioned earlier, now best is Best Denki online."
LG brand 14,LG,,9331,"When you put in cart, there is discount."

LG brand 14,LG,,9337,At the same time if you bring along a new M2 ssd.
LG brand 14,LG,,9337,The technician can install for you free of charge.
LG brand 14,LG,,9338,Anyone tried Xiaomi 65W Usb-c PD charger?

LG brand 14,LG,,9341,No slow down
LG brand 14,LG,,9342,65W charger can charge but slow.
LG brand 14,LG,,9342,100W charging is the best
LG brand 14,LG,,9343,There are number of 100w pd chargers available but cost at least $60+.
LG brand 14,LG,,9343,Will wait for a while.

LG brand 14,LG,,9346,"Hi guys, i read some replies here about charging the laptop with USB-C."
LG brand 14,LG,,9346,Can i ask if it means i can charge the laptop using just USB-C connected to a PD adapter?
LG brand 14,LG,,9346,I have this anker 5port USB-C 60W adapter which i use to charge my macbook
LG brand 14,LG,,9346,so i am also looking out for laptops that can charge via USB-C so that i do not have to bring so many afdapters out.
LG brand 14,LG,,9346,Thank you.
LG brand 14,LG,,9347,Anybody knows if LG is selling the Gram directly?
LG brand 14,LG,,9347,"Was looking forward to the quarterly IT/PC shows to pick up a 15""/17"" Gram."
LG brand 14,LG,,9347,But guess those mass exhibitions and shows will not be taking place anytime soon.
LG brand 14,LG,,9348,You need a powerbank which supports PD USB-C charging otherwise you'll need to carry the PD USB-C adapter and search for ac outlet outdoor
LG brand 14,LG,,9348,Your USB-C cable needs to be able to withstand 100W charging with 20A/5V if you are using 100W charging.
LG brand 14,LG,,9348,Choose your cables carefully
LG brand 14,LG,,9349,You can call up LG directly and ask them
LG brand 14,LG,,9350,Think LG is on Lazada.

LG brand 14,LG,,9350,"Looking to get the 14"""
LG brand 14,LG,,9351,So far I think best denki is the cheapest

LG brand 14,LG,,9352,Cause it's not stated on the website unlike in Lazada.
LG brand 14,LG,,9352,TIA

LG brand 14,LG,,9354,Based on this brochure should still have.
LG brand 14,LG,,9354,Best denki Harvey Norman courts challenger should be considered official retailer as well
LG brand 14,LG,,9355,"Oh, i didn't know about the cable"
LG brand 14,LG,,9355,must withstand 100w.
LG brand 14,LG,,9355,I will check on the one
LG brand 14,LG,,9355,im using to charge my macbook.
LG brand 14,LG,,9355,Thank you so much.
LG brand 14,LG,,9356,What I meant if you are using 100W charging then your cable must be rated for it.
LG brand 14,LG,,9356,"Similarly, for 65W charging the cable needs to be rated for that"
LG brand 14,LG,,9357,"Oh oh, haha."
LG brand 14,LG,,9357,i got what you mean.

LG brand 14,LG,,9358,however there isn't a setting to disable it.

LG brand 14,LG,,9383,Went back to Funan.
LG brand 14,LG,,9383,The laptop works fine with their LG 4k monitor.
LG brand 14,LG,,9383,"Probably some compatibility issue, though my TV works fine with all my other devices at 4k 60hz."
LG brand 14,LG,,9383,Screen uniformity issue
LG brand 14,LG,,9383,"it looks like most of the sets I saw have the same issue, some worse, some better."
LG brand 14,LG,,9383,So I guess mine is normal.
LG brand 14,LG,,9383,Think I will just sell it haha.
LG brand 14,LG,,9383,The weight is really good though
LG brand 14,LG,,9384,Don't sabo buyers lah.
LG brand 14,LG,,9384,Bring it back to LG Svc Ctr and exchange for a good one.
LG brand 14,LG,,9384,After that you can sell it
LG brand 14,LG,,9385,Haha I guess I'm just too picky ba.
LG brand 14,LG,,9385,"This year I tried Lenovo, Dell hp and now LG."
LG brand 14,LG,,9385,All got uniformity issues where one side of the screen has a bit of reddish tint and slighter green tint on other side.
LG brand 14,LG,,9385,Maybe it's my eyes
LG brand 14,LG,,9385,Anyway I'm selling not cos of uniformity issue
LG brand 14,LG,,9385,I took a look again and measured uniformity with a colour calibrator...
LG brand 14,LG,,9385,Seems within the tolerance range.
LG brand 14,LG,,9385,Probably just my eyes?
LG brand 14,LG,,9385,but because the laptop isn't compatible with my 4k TV at 60hz for some reason.
LG brand 14,LG,,9385,Not a hardware issue since it works fine with LG monitors.
LG brand 14,LG,,9385,Probably a bug in the firmware somewhere but difficult to fix since they are from different brands?
LG brand 14,LG,,9385,"Anyway, not to say the LG is bad or what."
LG brand 14,LG,,9385,For most users it is a good laptop.
LG brand 14,LG,,9385,"Gen 2 usb-a ports on both sides pleasantly surprised when I tested for myself with my NVMe ssd, thunderbolt 3 port, large battery and super lightweight."
LG brand 14,LG,,9386,Has anyone plugged in their LG gram to a 1440p 144hz monitor before through hdmi?
LG brand 14,LG,,9386,Realise I max out at 120hz thru hdmi port.
LG brand 14,LG,,9386,"Think probably the port has not enough bandwidth for full hdmi 2.0 since it has to drive 2 Gen2 USB ports, up to 2 NVMe SSD and thunderbolt 3 too"
LG brand 14,LG,,9387,From below.
LG brand 14,LG,,9387,HDMI 1.4 supports at 30Hz
LG brand 14,LG,,9387,HDMI 1.4b supports up to 60Hz
LG brand 14,LG,,9387,HDMI 2.0 supports up to 60Hz.
LG brand 14,LG,,9387,HDMI 2.1
LG brand 14,LG,,9387,can support up to 120Hz
LG brand 14,LG,,9387,I think the LG GRAM comes with HDMI 1.4 if I'm not wrong.
LG brand 14,LG,,9387,If it's true then how come you are getting 120Hz?
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,It is not stated.
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,Called LG hotline before I bought
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,but no one could give me an answer.
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,Destiny88 mentioned it's HDMI 1.4
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,previously
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,"but if it's HDMI 1.4, it can only drive 4K at 30Hz and 1440p at 75Hz."
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,"However, when I tested in Best Denki on their LG monitor, I can manage to get 4K at 60Hz, which seems to mean that it supports HDMI 2.0."
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,"But based on my experience so far, it seems like the HDMI 2.0 support is ""in between"""
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,", cos 4k at 60Hz doesn't work on my 4K TV and 1440p"
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,only works at 120Hz on my Acer monitor
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,but this also means it is better than HDMI 1.4 which will cap at 75hz.
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,"So I was just wondering if anyone has a 1440p 144hz monitor or 4k monitor who can share his or her experiences as well, so I can report the problem to LG or if officially, it can only support up to HDMI 1.4b."
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,"The Usb-c to hdmi 2.0 adapter I have works fine at 4k 60hz and 1440p144, so not a big issue."
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,Though I would prefer not having to use an adapter so I can reserve the usb-c port for charging.
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,Btw I realise the bios has a secret cheat code...
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,Ctrl alt f7 can unlock advanced options.
LG brand 14,LG,,9388,"There's an option to enable ""fast charging"" though this doesn't seem to improve charging speeds."
LG brand 14,LG,,9389,When you tested at Best Denki using LG monitor was that monitor a 4K monitor?
LG brand 14,LG,,9389,Look at my above posting again.
LG brand 14,LG,,9389,I think the LG GRAM could be using the HDMI 1.4b spec
LG brand 14,LG,,9390,"Yes, it was a 4K monitor, 3840x2160 running at 60Hz in full 8-bit RGB mode."
LG brand 14,LG,,9390,I went back to double check yesterday.
LG brand 14,LG,,9390,Hdmi 1.4b supports 4k at 30hz and full hd at 120hz.
LG brand 14,LG,,9390,See https://hdmi.org/spec/hdmi1_4b
LG brand 14,LG,,9391,Your quote
LG brand 14,LG,,9391,"There's an option to enable ""fast charging"" though this doesn't seem to improve charging speeds."
LG brand 14,LG,,9391,Unquote
LG brand 14,LG,,9391,Use for reverse fast charging a handphone using the USB-C port?
LG brand 14,LG,,9391,I tried the Ctrl Alt F7 it don't work leh
LG brand 14,LG,,9392,You must go inside BIOS first then press the key combination...
LG brand 14,LG,,9392,You should see a new tab
LG brand 14,LG,,9392,Advanced appearing.
LG brand 14,LG,,9392,Looks like you can customise a hell lot of stuff inside this tab.
LG brand 14,LG,,9392,I don't really dare to touch hahaha
LG brand 14,LG,,9393,"Can you go to the old Windows sound control panel, then to Recording and see which device is set as recording device?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9393,"Anyway, an update on my case."
LG brand 14,LG,,9393,In the end I managed to sell the laptop and go for UX425JA.
LG brand 14,LG,,9393,"Strangely, the UX425JA also have same issues with the HDMI port."
LG brand 14,LG,,9393,"Thus, I guess it is an issue with the Intel Ice Lake implementation of HDMI."
LG brand 14,LG,,9393,"Maybe personal preference, but I like the matte display on the Asus more."
LG brand 14,LG,,9393,"Obviously, the LG gram is far more upgradeable."
LG brand 14,LG,,9394,Btw gain city selling the 14z90n for 1618 online.
LG brand 14,LG,,9394,Cheapest right now.
LG brand 14,LG,,9395,"Given a choice, I choose glossy lcd without 2nd thought.."
LG brand 14,LG,,9395,Zenbook is a fine choice.
LG brand 14,LG,,9395,"But if put on lap, isnt it kinda uncomfortable?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9395,The bottom is not flat after open the screen
LG brand 14,LG,,9395,Sent from HUAWEI LYA-L29 using GAGT
LG brand 14,LG,,9396,Hmm I wouldn't mind if glossy glass.
LG brand 14,LG,,9396,The LG kind not really my thing.
LG brand 14,LG,,9396,Haven't tried putting on my lap though.
LG brand 14,LG,,9396,Usually I will put on those laptop cushion if I use on my bed.
LG brand 14,LG,,9396,I guess it might be slightly less comfortable
LG brand 14,LG,,9397,Good news.
LG brand 14,LG,,9397,Lg gram support wpa3 wifi protocol
LG brand 14,LG,,9398,Great news 👍
LG brand 14,LG,,9399,"Hi LG gram users, anyone tried charging their gram via USB C?"
LG brand 14,LG,,9399,I am using the Anker PowerPort +5 USB C which supports 60W output I can charge my MacBook Pro with no issues
LG brand 14,LG,,9399,"but whenever i plug it to my gram, there is always this warning
'"
LG brand 14,LG,,9399,An auxiliary power source with a lower rating has been connected.
LG brand 14,LG,,9399,"The battery may be discharged during the use, so it is advisable to connect a properly rated adaptor before the battery level reaches its danger point'
."
LG brand 14,LG,,9399,I look at the original power adaptor and its rated at 48.07W output leh
LG brand 14,LG,,9399,"so technically, the Anker should work."
LG brand 14,LG,,9399,i was gonna buy another Anker with 60w USB C to put in office so that i have no need to bring the original adaptor
LG brand 14,LG,,9399,"but now, im having second thoughts."
LG brand 14,LG,,9400,I'm using the ZENDURE Supertank 27000mah
LG brand 14,LG,,9400,100WH power bank with PD 100W
LG brand 14,LG,,9400,to charge the LG GRAM 17
LG brand 14,LG,,9401,"Ok, but i am looking more at wall charger as i don't see the need to have such a big powerbank."
LG brand 14,LG,,9401,haha
LG brand 14,LG,,9401,Prolink has a 100w wall charger.
LG brand 14,LG,,9401,Looks good.
LG brand 14,LG,,9402,If you need to carry around then look for
LG brand 14,LG,,9402,AUKEY OMNIA.
LG brand 14,LG,,9402,AUKEY just released a small size 100W PD wall charger
LG brand 14,LG,,9403,"My LG widescreen monitor has USB-C port that can do video input, USB, PD charging at same time for LG Gram."
LG brand 14,LG,,9403,the PD charging is only 60W
LG brand 14,LG,,9403,but it charges Gram very well.
LG brand 14,LG,,9403,No CPU slow down at all.

LG brand 14,LG,,9404,"Wow, i think its Aukey Omnia."
LG brand 14,LG,,9404,Single port 100w.
LG brand 14,LG,,9404,Looks good for me as i don't need so many ports.
LG brand 14,LG,,9404,Thanks alot for the recommendation.
LG brand 14,LG,,9405,If really urgent can get the APPLE 96W PD USB-C charger but bigger size only.
LG brand 14,LG,,9405,Available here.
LG brand 14,LG,,9405,No come with cable so must buy a 100W rated USB-C cable
LG brand 14,LG,,9405,I'm using it to charge my Zendure SuperTank 27000 mAh 100W PD power bank

LG brand 14,LG,,9407,Reason the laptop battery hardly able to do video Conference for 5 hour on high spec and wifi setting.
LG brand 14,LG,,9407,Thus need to charge.
LG brand 14,LG,,9408,If you need one urgently you can get the APPLE 96W PD USB-C charger.
LG brand 14,LG,,9408,It's bigger in size than the AUKEY OMNIA and does NOT come with a cable.
LG brand 14,LG,,9408,You can get the 2m length APPLE 100W charging cable or any other cable rated at 100W
LG brand 14,LG,,9409,The apple cable is very good...

LG brand 14,LG,,9409,Thick and durable and still can charge at full speed even at 2m length.

Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9445,Negative.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9445,"This is the SSD throttling, not the CPU."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9445,"Anyway, I have always been using intelligent cooling, so it is not a matter of the power profile nor cooling performance."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9445,I've run that SSD externally with a heatsink on it as well.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9445,"After few mins performing a cloning activity, the heatsink got scorching hot that you can't even touch it for a second."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9446,"Personally, no comments on the choices made by individuals."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9446,"Hardware wise, it is an above average build compared to other similarly configured brands."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9446,"However, I wouldn't pay $1389 SGD for it."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9447,"Don't take my word for it, but do lookup for reviews out there with this Ryzen 7 4700U."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9447,"Probably the best performance you can get for the amount of money spent, i.e. best bang for buck."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9447,Been using AMD Ryzen CPUs on both desktops and laptop for years with no issues.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9448,"I got mine at $1,250 previously though I sold it off shortly after."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9448,Think another member also sold it off.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9448,"If CPU performance is your only consideration then yes, $1,398 could be a good deal."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9448,"But some other aspects which make this not so sweet of a deal:
- No fingerprint reader
- Horrible colours"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9448,
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9448,cant display a decent shade of red.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9448,- Restricted to USB 3 Gen 1 speeds and only HDMI 1.4b need to use Type-C to output 4k60Hz. - Plastic chassis
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9448,feels a little cheap.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9448,- Supplied power adapter is only 2 pin so you will get the metal tingling sensation when charging and you touch the lid.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9448,-
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9448,GPU performance is better than iGPU
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9448,"but still pales in comparison with, say, a laptop with MX350 and above graphics."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9448,So its kinda a neither here
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9448,nor there laptop with the exception of the awesome CPU performance.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9449,AMD APU
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9449,i would stay away..
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9449,seriously.. using Ryzen 5 3400G now and its horrible.. frequent hanging and crash.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9449,"Already update BIOS, drivers all to latest but issue still occur..
until i went online to search for solution and changed a few settings and registry"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9449,it become more stable from crash
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9449,/hang a few times a day to once every few days..
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9450,That is why research before buy but sometimes is really heng suay as there is always a lemon units.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9450,"Anyway laptop and desktop have different sets of issues, don't think its fair to compare like that."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9451,I've been using the Ryzen 5 3400G and its stable.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9451,"Initial crashes for my case has nothing to do with AMD, but rather the motherboard maker pushing too much voltage to my CPU even on auto settings which is causing it to overheat and freeze/ shutdown."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9451,"Lower the voltage from auto 1.54V to 1.3375V now, and everything works fine and significantly cooler."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9451,I am not sure if you have identified the culprit for the crashes in your case?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9451,It could be a result of things like RAM incompatibility or PSU issues that cause the crashes.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9452,I believe it is a combination of plastic base and aluminum lid.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9452,"But to me, it feels fine."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9452,"For the power supply, the one that came with my IdeaPad 5 14 Intel version came with 3 pins."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9452,"Having said that, I rarely use it just like when I was using my ThinkPad E485."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9452,"Since I can charge via Type C, I usually 90% of the time charge it using a Type C charger."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9452,"GPU wise, I think its to be expected for a 15W APU."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9452,A dedicated graphic solution like a MX350 will always be more ideal.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9452,"But that may result in shorter battery life, and more heat."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9452,It also introduced some complication on my IdeaPad 5 where the HDMI don't work no matter what I do.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9452,I had to resort to using a USB type C to HDMI dongle to get the second screen to work.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9453,Why does SSD run so hot?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9453,Hotter than HDD and almost as hot as low-power processor.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9454,Metal tingling sensation?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9454,You mean when you plug in then got spark and kanna electiric shock?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9454,Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9455,No spark...
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9455,"But if you run your fingers along the metal lid, there's a small electric current you can feel."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9455,It's common across all devices which is plugged in through 2 pin charger and you touch the metal part

Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9457,Hmm can i know what laptop did you buy then?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9457,Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9458,Or is there a better choice than this model?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9458,Value for money
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9458,Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9459,In the end I used back my old XPS 13.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9459,Even less value for money
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9459,haha.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9459,"If you can wait a month or two, you will have much better options, eg ThinkPad or the HP envy"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9459,x360
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9460,Uh huh but the new xps 13 is overrated and so expensive.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9460,I got my refund from lazada.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9460,Do you mean thinkad or hp envy is better?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9460,But i am looking for 14 inch.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9460,They have new models ah?

Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9461,yours is the ideapad?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9461,is it 300nits?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9461,so bad meh
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9462,"IdeaPad 5 14""."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9462,I measured 350 nits actually although on paper 300 nits.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9462,Maybe 10 years ago I will call it acceptable.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9462,But all my other screens are sRGB or even DCI-P3 eg smartphone etc
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9462,so it becomes very noticeable.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9462,If you not picky then
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9462,okay lor
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9462,haha
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9463,Lenovo ThinkPad T14 probably coming out next month?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9463,Not sure how the price will be like for the AMD model though.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9463,"Yoga Slim 7 also supposedly going to launch soon,"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9463,although like no news recently.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9463,HP envy
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9463,"x360 got new model, but not launched in SG yet."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9463,Probably in 1 or 2 mths time?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9464,Not sure if the prices are competitive.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9464,Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9465,300 quite good already for amd.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9465,Oem usually go lower at 250nits and bad color accuracy.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9465,Screen wise cannot compare with MacBook.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9466,so actually what is the min nit should one target?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9466,"also we can also upgrade lenovo 14"" overseas for better screen right?"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9467,The nits is not the issue.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9467,300 nits is more than enough.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9467,The issue is the gamut -- only 45% NTSC or 57% sRGB.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9467,"This means that it can't display a lot of colours properly, e.g. bright red is a bit orange on the IdeaPad 5 for example"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9468,can upgrade color ma?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9469,"Can, just source for the FRU online and replace lor... Need to disassemble a lot of things tho"

Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9479,Is Lazada Atrix a reliable reseller ?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9480,Their prices are cheap.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9480,But seems shady to me.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9480,Beware
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9480,I rather play abit more to get from official retailers for a piece of mind especially for laptop where one component down means whole laptop useless.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9481,I dun work or any connection with Lenovo or Atrix.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9481,Why is Atrix shady?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9481,Or u just assume they are.

Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9481,"If your laptop is faulty, even 1 component faulty, u still can go back to Lenovo for support."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9481,There are reasons why manufacturer prefers resellers and distribution biz model and pricing is different.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9482,"if get the items, good."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9483,"I ordered the Ideapad 5 from them previously, so far so good."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9483,Most laptop brands now come with a manufacturer seal.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9483,Just need to make sure the laptop box is sealed with no signs of tampering and the specs indicated at the side match what you bought.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9484,"Purchased from them before, the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5."

Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9486,"If u are very worry about buying from a reseller, Atrix then buy direct but if u read buying direct from Lenovo, there are also bad reviews on their out sourced service center?"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9486,So how?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9486,Build n manufacture or repair your own brand of laptop?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9486,"BTW your earlier context was,"

Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9488,"Again, no point debating on this."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9488,"There are good and bad reviews, u paying for it, just buy accordingly to what pleases u."

Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9490,Is this a good deal?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Lenovo,Ideapad,9491,If you ok with 8gb ram I rather get the latest envy 13 or the Asus ux425.

MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9528,https://www.lazada.sg//products/i385...x&urlFlag=true
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9528,any one has experience with this China brand.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9528,it seems to have good reviews in Lazada
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9529,I was interested as well.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9529,I feel the price vs specs is quite attractive.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9529,However I am hesitant because the warranty is going to be a problem.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9529,A lot of these China sellers always say X years of international warranty.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9529,However sending it back may be a problem due to the size and weight of the item.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9529,"Thus, I feel it is better to spend more and buy one with local warranty."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9529,"If the laptop that you are considering is very cheap, then may be worth taking the risk."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9530,its legit.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9530,My colleague bought the $700 one.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9530,The metal doesnt feel good though.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9530,"The cheapest is 330 before $15 shop coupon, and you get full hd ips screen and 8th gen processor."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9530,At these prices i wonder why people bother with more expensive second hand laptops that have been used for more than 6 years.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9530,The stock change quite often too.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9530,During the 11/11 sale you could get a laptop with 1650 for less than 600
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9531,"if i see correctly, the local agent is based in Singapore and warranty"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9531,is Singapore based too.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9531,thats why i got attracted if Singapore has local agent for after sales.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9532,I see.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9532,"I went to check again, and yes, most of them have a 1 year local agent warranty."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9532,But do note that I saw 1 with 1 year international warranty.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9533,i send a chat query to the company.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9533,Waiting for their response.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9534,They replied that they have local service centre at Eco-Tech@Sunview
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9534,So looking good!
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9535,Good to know they have a local service center.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9535,The location does seem a bit remote in the Benoi area though.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9536,"Because when you buy a reputed brand that's 6 years old, especially when it's a business laptop, parts are easy to find."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9536,I can buy a brand new 3rd party battery with quality LG cells inside produced last year for a 10 year old ThinkPad.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9536,"If you buy God knows what brand, the second it breaks out of warranty for whatever tiny part even the power button, and I have experienced this before with cheap laptops the whole thing has to be thrown away."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9537,Looks good.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9537,I went to taobao and check the reviews as well as some YouTube videos.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9537,Think I'm gng to get one too just to play
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9538,"I have a almost 10 year old Thinkpad that's still working fine, but even a 3rd party battery cost about $80?"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9538,And cannot run much apps and slow to start up.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9538,A brand new laptop for 300-500 use for 3 years or so everyday less than $1
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9539,N4100 is weak processor......
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9540,Nonsense.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9540,My Chinese laptop has an Apollo Lake.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9540,I use it to perform packet captures and traffic analysis.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9540,More than up to the task.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9541,Can it play Crysis?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9542,"For a 330 bucks laptop, and your expectation is to play Crysis?"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9542,Really?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9542,The reality is that no current Intel integrated graphic is capable of playing Crysis smoothly regardless its a 50 bucks CPU or a i9 processor.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9542,There is no difference between a GPU pushing 5 FPS vs <30 FPS since they will be unbearably slow to play.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9542,"With an option for 8GB of ram with the N4100, most people can use it for work, watching movies, etc."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9542,And this does not come with some crappy TN panel and eMMC drive.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9542,"In this case, the N4100 laptop is a very good buy @ below 400 bucks."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9543,n4100 is faster than third gen core i3/i5 laptops ppl sell for 300 in carousell
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9544,"Yes, in multi tasking and GPU I believe."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9544,This is due to 2 more physical cores and newer GPU.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9545,dont understand why people buy old laptops tho when new ones are less than $100 more.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9545,"dead battery, 1366x768"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9545,"screen, no ips, no hardware acceleration for video, 35w processor, heavy, bad physical condition."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9546,I feel refurbished laptops used to be popular because of the high prices of laptops with decent performance.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9546,"With the onslaught of cheap Chinese laptops, with decent enough processors, it does negate the benefits."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9546,"There are certainly some concerns about cheap Chinese laptops, which we read quite often."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9546,"For me, I am most concern about the battery used."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9546,"Longevity wise, I can't complain for the price, as long as it doesn't bite the dust within a year."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9546,"With local warranty here, I think it adds a little bit of confidence to their products."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9546,I think it is still good that people are buying old refurbished laptops because it is environmentally friendly.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9546,The amount of electronic waste is actually staggering.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9547,Same sentiments on the amount of electronic waste.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9547,"I got an A condition refurbished Zbook 15 for $500 - i7 4800mq, Quadro 2100m, 16gb, 256gb Samsung 840 Pro, 3G modem."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9547,"Upgraded it further to 32gb 4 slots plus a 512gb mSata, AC wifi"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9547,Surprisingly no whitelist
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9547,So there are good deals online.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9548,Just ordered one and try.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9548,Got the 4GB 240GB HD.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9548,Will get another 4GB at aliexpress if I can open the casing to upgrade.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9549,maibenben?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9549,current prices are expensive.it used to be 333 for the n4100 and 389 for the mx250 version.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9550,The 6-cell battery I bought from Aliexpress for an old notebook became 0mAh in less than 2 years
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9550,Makes you wonder about the batteries in refurbished laptops and China laptops
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,"I got a similar one 14"" thin and light with J4105/8GDDR4/128GSSD."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,"J4105 is desktop version of N4100, faster but consume more power, somehow still can go into passive-cooled laptop."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,These China brand all same same.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,1688RMB paid 338SGD exclude freight.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,"Buy it because I need a thin and light <1.3kg for web surfing, torrents and Youtube, and bring around on holiday, watch movie on a plane."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,"Uses a standard 12V power adapter included, so it can use a power bank with PD2.0 while on a plane."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,I do not need warranty as I can do basic repair.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,Parts from TB is cheap.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,This laptop can do 1080p but not 4k.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,Gaming is out also.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,"Display is my main complain, poor viewng angle and colour,"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,the spec they put is BS.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,"Built quality is acceptable, cannot compare with main stream but decent."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,"Comparing to similar spec laptop in SG market, this is really cheap"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,"I did quite some checking around, including similar one at Popular ."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,But if you need something better please spent more and get higher spec laptop.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,"Higher spec laptop is much more expensive, so might as well buy branded one here!"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,"Self upgraded to 512G SSD from my old laptop and did some DIY on the cooling they have it on Youtube, different brand but all same same lah."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9551,Used for 6 months already.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9552,"Btw, it has pre-installed working Chinese Win10, which was reinstalled to English version!"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9552,Working Office2019 cost another $4.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9553,"Yes, the prices went up significantly."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9553,The 8GB 240GB config used to be around 380 before the 15 of 330 store coupon and before any credit card discount.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9553,Now its 480
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9553,+.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9554,"I guess its a risk, and depends on risk appetite of the person."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9554,"For the price, I feel the battery you got from Aliexpress should be quite inexpensive, relative to the official store cost."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9554,"Moreover if you look at my case where I got the E485, the battery actually started acting up few months after I bought the laptop."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9554,"As I needed to use it, I did not immediately RMA it."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9554,"Now they are telling me the warranty is only a year, i.e. warranty over."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9554,So things like battery issues may also happen with big brands like Lenovo and Dell.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9554,I experienced same issue with Dell corporate laptop where the new laptop refuses to charge over 50%.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9554,On site repair person had to replace the battery to get it to work.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9555,TS link don't work
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9555,Only found this link if i search shipped from SG
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9555,Can't see any specs.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9555,What's 240HD 120HD?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9555,Anyone got the lappy already and can give a review?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9556,Still waiting for mine...
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9557,I also got E485 so far so good.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9557,Enough for the kids to study from home.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9557,Used for more than a year.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9557,Came across this.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9557,Might as well try.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9557,"Anyway don't know 4G and 8G, around $100 difference."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9557,Last check aliexpress selling 4G ram 30 or so.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9558,"brand, parts?don't think ppl old laptops to bring out."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9558,sometimes as a backup
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9559,There is a model that comes with Samsung OLED display which was very enticing for me.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9559,I don't think you get laptop with OLED screen at below 2k
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9559,was 1.9K during the brand flash sale.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9559,"But on the flipside, it is quite a lot of money to pay for a Chinese PC maker, and I feel the laptop will struggle with cooling the components due to the slim chassis."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9560,So which model is worth to get for this brand?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9560,Branded laptops in sg are always overpriced but underspec.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9560,Lol
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9560,Sent from Samsung Galaxy Note 8 using GAGT
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9561,The cheapest is worth it.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9561,"The rest, not so since you can get a new lenovo ryzen for less than 800"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9562,I agree that you should not spend too much money on it.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9562,"Do be mindful that its only got a year of warranty, and not sure how good is the after sales service."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9562,"I also observed that the specs are quite good, but"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9562,"given how slim the chassis are, I am not sure if it can keep up with the heat output."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9562,"If you are looking for higher end specs, do consider brands like Aftershock which tends to give you better specs for lesser price."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9562,The big brands typically charge you significantly more for higher end specs.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9563,Thank you very much to both of you.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9563,I will take note.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9563,Sent from Samsung Galaxy Note 8 using GAGT
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9564,anyone bought it?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9564,any reviews?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9565,Received it yesterday.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9565,I am very impressed...
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9565,It looked expensive.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9565,My elder kid with his E490 thinkpad kept asking is his didi new notebook better than his.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9565,Hahahaha
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9565,The quantity is at least twice the amount I paid for.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9565,Get the cheapest version with 240gb hd and get a stick of 4gb ram yourself.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9565,Come with win10.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9565,"If you need for simple office work, study or work from home kind, then this is a very good buy."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9566,"HI, Have you upgraded the ram?"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9566,How easy is it to do this?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9566,Thanks.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9567,You got the laptop with the Pentium Silver processor?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9568,thanks for the review.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9568,how long did delivery take?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9568,which model did you buy and how much?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9569,"I gotten the pink color, grey oos, the cheapest version with n4100, 240gb hd and 4gb ram."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9569,Then I ordered another 4gb ram from aliexpress @ 26.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9569,Will install once it arrives.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9569,Took around 3 weeks.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9569,Ordered on 23 Apr..
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9569,Got it @
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9569,"$337, with the coupons."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9570,Waiting for ram shipment.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9570,"Got @ 26, 4gb ram."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9571,"Yes, the N4100 4 cores."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9571,For simple office works should be suffice...
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9572,"I think it is still a good price, despite its not the lowest I've seen."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9572,"For light usage/ home base learning, this works perfectly."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9572,"There will be no other big brands that can offer such a good value since this comes with a superior screen, SSD vs eMMC, and upgradable dual channel ram vs single channel soldered ram."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9573,Is the version n4100 with mx250 at $536 worth it?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9573,The ryzen with Vega8 is around 400 plus.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9573,The screen bezel looks bad though.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9574,Not worth.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9574,"The CPU is too weak, so"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9574,"even if you have a dedicated MX250, the performance is still going to be poor."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9574,The CPU bottleneck will be very apparent in this case because you can only game a low resolution and graphic settings.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9574,The Ryzen option is more attractive at this price point.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9575,The n4100 with mx250 is worth it when it was selling for $360 dos version.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9575,A few weeks ago they jack up to 500+
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9575,not worth anymore
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9575,The problem with the ryzen 2500u is that the idle power consumption is high and battery is 36wh which is very little.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9575,You can expect 2-3h battery life only.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9575,Of course if you dont intend to use as portable laptop
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9575,then it is a non-issue.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9575,"processor is slightly faster than intel 6th gen quad core, and faster than 8th gen Core i5-8250U"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9576,"If it is 360, which is slightly higher in price than the version without the MX250, then I agree it may be worth it."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9576,However don't expect good gaming performance on it still because of the severe bottleneck from the CPU.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9576,"In addition, I am also concern about the cooling system since most laptops running N4100 have passive or minimal active cooling solution."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9576,"If they use the same cooler with the MX250, it is gonna be very hot."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9576,"The non Max Q MX250 draws 25W at load, vs 6W for the N4100."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9577,So the $360
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9577,N4100 is the only one worth buying?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9577,What's the estimated N4100 battery life for that base model?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9578,i dont know battery size.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9578,if assume worst case 36wh battery /7w cpu = 5h
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9579,It will be difficult to estimate without knowing the capacity of the battery.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9579,"Generally, the N4100 is very frugal when it comes to power consumption."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9579,"However if you add the MX250 in there, that changes the equation quite significantly."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9579,"As pointed out earlier, the Max Q version of the MX250 should ideally draw 10W, though it draws more in practice."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9579,The non Max Q version of the MX250 is expected to consume 25W as per specs.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9579,"If it is only the N4100, I think the laptop will be passively cooled."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9579,"But in this case, I don't think passive cooling is going to cut it."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9579,"So if you further add an active cooling to the laptop, it will impact battery life further."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9580,"From what it sounds, look like only the cheapest model at $337 is worth buying, pity only available in pink atm."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9581,Don't get me wrong.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9581,It really depends on what you are looking out for.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9581,"The MX250 model, it is actually very attractively priced."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9581,"So if you think you want to have some light gaming, it may be a decent alternative."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9581,"If you are looking at just light usage and with an emphasis on battery life, then the version without the MX250 should address your needs better."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9582,is their xiaomai 6a worth it at it's current price?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9582,8gb ram 240ssd @ $551.70
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9583,"Bro, can share the link to buy the 4gb ram from aliexpress?"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9583,Thanks
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9584,"Bro, do you have to reinstall the chinese OS to english yourself?"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9584,Can share how to get working office2019 for $4?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9584,Thanks
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9585,Price for Xiaomai 6A has went up quite a bit since i bought one unit in April.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9585,Unless you are in a hurry to get one.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9585,else you can wait for better discounts
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9585,In case if you need a review you can check out the below link on youtube
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9585,Do take note that the review is on the older Xiaomai 6A with MX150.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9585,The one on sale at lazada comes with MX250.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9585,"For work, entertainment and light gaming"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9585,this machine does it all for an affordable price.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9585,Tested with L4D2 with under max settings the games is pretty smooth.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9585,"And considering a 15.6"" lappy at 1.7kg is a plus point."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9585,Got the 16GB RAM with 240GB M2 SSD.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9585,After receiving the unit I added a spare 240GB normal SATA hdd to it.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9586,Mind sharing how much you got it for?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9587,I got the 16GB RAM 240GB SSD for SGD 494 after the 15 promo discount
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9588,More than $100 more now.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9588,How's the usage so far?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9588,Are you bothered by the thick bezel?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9589,Overall user experience has been great so far.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9589,I had 2nd thoughts about the celeron CPU in the first place as well.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9589,"After watching the youtube review and weighing in the usage and purpose for this laptop, felt that getting the celeron version fits the bill."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9589,Not really bothered by the bezel because the top and sides bezels are still slim.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9589,It's only the bottom bezel that is thick
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9589,but that's due to the webcam placement and the logo.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9589,Comparing Xiaomai 6A with the Damai E527 and felt that E527 has thick uniform bezels on all sides.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9590,You're lucky you got it before they jacked up prices of everything again by $100.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9590,Now not worth buying.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9590,Can't wait for mine to arrive this week.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9590,240GB increased from 311 to $436
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9591,All these entry-level Chinese laptops don't get enough attention and love.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9591,"8GB of memory, an M.2 SSD, backlit keyboards and metal chassis is a lot of value for that $400."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9591,I own three and have not regretted since.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9591,"For their price, even if one fails I can get another one and still not be out of cash."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9591,The N and J series processors have enough beef to get all the typical computing requirements done properly.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9592,oh ya.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9592,i got it mixed up with the E527.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9592,that bezel really damn thick.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9592,i shall wait and see if the price will drop.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9592,"thinking of buying as an ""upgrade""to WFH since the price is really good."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9593,Really attractive at the price you gotten.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9593,Using for normal browsing?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9594,People are generally skeptical and rightfully they should when they see some bespoke Chinese brand.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9594,"To be honest, I would not have paid attention to it as well if not because someone mentioned it here."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9594,The specs vs dollar and upgradeability is something that the big brands will never match.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9595,N4100 is just 10% slower than 7th gen i3.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9595,Can use it normally without worry
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9596,Will get it if the price is back to 3xx.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9596,Haha.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9596,Just feel that it's not worth with the current price.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9597,"If above 500, think not so attractive liao."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Received it today.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Glossy screen looks really amazing.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Not sure about srgb should be more than 50% but less than 100%
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,freebies included are mouse and mousepad and keyboard cover
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Comes with Western digital SSD which is surprising.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,"I had a few China PC and laptop, normally they use SanDisk or unknown brand"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Uses torx screws.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Hard to remove.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Laptop doesn't have any fans.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Doesn't get hot.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Audio is above average.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Speakers are loud.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Pros:
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Good fhd ips screen for the price.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Processor able to decode 4k hevc and vp9 YouTube
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Good speakers for laptop.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,branded SSD.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Top and base made of metal
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Genuine windows
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,10 1909 Home.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Cons: Ram not upgradable
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Small battery of 38wh 3-4h depending on use
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Only 1 USB 3 slot.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,No hdmi output there is thunderbolt logo tho
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,SSD partition is split with boot partition in between c drive and d drive.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,"Impossible to combine unless reinstall or use partition wizard to rearrange resize D drive smaller, move the 2 small partition to end of drive, then combine"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,"c and d
Drivers are unsigned."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,If you reinstall Windows you need to go test mode in order to install unsigned drivers
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,No kensington lock
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,For the price of $311-$40sold away
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,SSD=$271
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,", it's worth it."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9598,Opting for 8gb ram model is recommended
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9599,"Agree if the ram is soldered, then better to get the 8GB version."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9599,I have the impression that RAM is upgradeable.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9599,"For slightly above 300 bucks, it is certainly a good buy for the specs."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9600,Nice review of the Jinmai 6.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9600,For an ultraportable and work based requirement laptop this model fits the bill.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9601,"For those with the same jinmai 6, under power options > advanced power setting you can limit maximum processor state to 50% while on battery."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9601,this reduces power consumption from 10w to 5w and battery life will increase from 3h to 6h.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9601,Using the windows power saving mode did no difference to power consumption.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9601,Best to set windows update to manual thru gpedit.msc and turn off windows defender.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9601,"Also the usb c port is thunderbolt, supports 4k 60hz resolution and pd charging"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9602,Oh no... I ordered another 4gb from aliexpress...
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9602,Haiz...
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9603,"i realised even from the poster at maibenben listing, you can see the ram is soldered"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9603,You can cancel order if ali havent ship
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9604,Never realised that.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9604,Anyway use it for my E490.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9604,No issue..
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9605,Just in case if any potential buyers have questions on the Maibenben products.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9605,Can chat with the  seller in Lazada and they will be happy to answer your questions.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9606,their response on the lazada one is quite fast de...
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9607,"Not worth it liao, can close thread."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9608,"Take note, its not thunderbolt 3."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9608,"It just supports display out, PD charging & 5gbps Data transfer"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9609,Really not worth anymore?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9609,Ive been comparing the prices and seems like they are pricing very competitively..
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9609,considering if I wanna pull the trigger on the Nvidia 150M model or not
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9610,you are right.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9610,couldnt find in hwinfo despite the tb icon beside the usb c port
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9610,I found out the panel is a chimei 1376 and notebook reviews says that the panel is 99% srgb.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9610,Battery life is about 8.5h of web browsing
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9611,I think the price is still very competitive just that you may not get the same pricing as before comparing to early adopters of Maibenben products.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9611,"My take is this: if you think the product meets your requirements and the price justifies you to leave your cash with them, go for it and don't look back anymore."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9611,Sometimes good deals may just fly past without you knowing it. ^^
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9612,Its amazing value that you get a 90+% sRGB panel here while we are complaining about getting some crappie LCD panel from Lenovo.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9613,Was an unexpected surprise.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9613,"My previous laptop a few years ago was Toshiba Chromebook 2 which had 98.5% sRGB screen, using a n2840 fanless processor installed windows 10."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9613,"Then upgraded to onda xiaoma 31 gold, which has not as good screen and fanless n3450."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9613,Sold it away at price I bought at after 2 years.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9613,"Now this maibenben has a good screen, fanless n4100 processor."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9613,3 generations of using atom processor
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9614,Maibenben gave me a $15 discount for their $100 increment.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9615,Faster than 3rd gen U chips
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9615,"yes, but not the M chips you find in cheapo"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9615,X230s
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9616,100 points difference is insignificant.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9616,7w vs 25w.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9616,i have x230
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9616,too
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9616,try playing 4k hevc or vp9 videos
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9616,Also it is no longer cheap.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9616,i bought mine at lazada for $168-$8dbs-$30 sold away ssd =$130.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9616,now can only buy for $230.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9616,tn monitor is
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9616,*
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9616,*

MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9620,So far so good.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9621,Do share how it is when you get it then.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9621,"I agree it is a little expensive for the class of CPU, and I hope they implement a decent cooling solution for the MX250."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9622,ips is lg technology.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9622,ads is similar used by non lg companies.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9622,if youre lucky you might get a high srgb monitor
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9623,"n4100 is a weak 7w processor, unlike 15w u series."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9623,Need to manage expectation.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9623,windows 10 is really resource heavy with windows updates and defender running all the time.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9623,to make it bearable and achieve long battery life you must make driver backup with doubledriver and reinstal windows pro or enterprise.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9623,this givws you option to pause windows updates
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9623,run manually and disable windows defender.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9624,Many models OOS
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9625,Why not Windows 10 LTSC?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9626,I'm not buying any N4100 laptop with price creeping into the S$600 range
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9627,"Its worth if it is below 400., assuming no dedicated graphic card."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9628,Any recommendation for casual gaming?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9628,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9629,Look for cheap 2500u or 3200u ryzen laptops
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9630,Looks like
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9630,my cpu performance is slightly faster than i3 7100u
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9631,I am using the Xiaomai 6A with MX250 Graphics to play CSGO and Dead By Daylight..
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9631,but of cos with Low settings.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9631,So far so good to my expectation.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9632,Currently looking at Dianas E527 with the good screen Ryzen
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9632,5 2500U 8Gb
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9632,6Gb usable and 240 ssd for 560 after minus 20 coupon is it worth it?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9633,"for this price, just get local Lenovo laptop, buy from online."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9633,it gives you more years of warranty and support.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9634,"If you can stack more discount coupons, i.e. 40 off 400 HSBC card discount, it will be an even better deal."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9634,"For the specs, I think the price is decent."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9635,Unfortunately I didnt get the bank Voucher
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9635,as I know gotten the standard charters
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9635,but I dont have standard charter card
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9636,how the battery life and does it heat up and produce lot of noise ?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9637,That same specs used to be 470 2 months ago.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9637,Their ryzen series not worth because the batteryis 38wh and first gen mobile ryzen has high idle power.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9637,so you can expect only 2-3h of use.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9637,If you dont intend to use like laptop then its not a problem.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9637,"If you intend to game, you need dual channel ram so need to add in upgrade cost"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9638,Managed to get it at 550 after 30 bucks voucher

MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9638,"Mainly used by fiancée for simultaneously YouTube music, FB game pool and slot machines and FB feed viewing and a few chrome tabs to find jobs and ms word for writing cv and job application."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9638,As my Budget is 600 max as myself is going to lose my job soon by end of year due to no more funding.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9638,The usable ram will be 5.9gb out of the 8 as 2Gb for the graphics.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9638,At most can get a sodimm  2nd Hand to make it 16gb 14gb usable.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9638,As for SSD does anyone know the default
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9638,240gb is it nvme m2 slot?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9638,Does it have a slot for sata SSD as I have a spare zotac mlc 240 ssd which I want to put in.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9638,I tried lenovo via educator pricing almost I get from Lenovo
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9638,is n4000 8 gb and 512ssd and cannot add as will void warranty.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9639,if you dont mind poor battery life then
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9639,its ok.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9639,similar to buying 8th gen core i7 but cheaper.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9639,you can look youtube reviews.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9639,i think got space for 2.5inch.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9640,She mostly going to use it at home
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9640,so I think the battery life still can be over come
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9640,Thats good for the 2.5 spot
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9641,Battery life I cant really tell as of now since I have been plugging it with power at home.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9641,"But I notice that whenever I powered it on the next nightas I normally use it at night , it says full charge at 20-30mins."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9641,So I am not sure why as the night before it was full charged at 100%.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9641,"Quite hot if I played game with it, normal wise should be ok."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9641,As onboard have 2 GPU. 1 is integrated and 1 is the MX250.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9641,So only for games
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9641,", it will auto use MX250, normal usage will be the onboard gpu."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9641,Soundwise - Not much noise.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9642,When did you get it and how much was if when you got it?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9642,I realised the price keep changing.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9643,"The jinmai 6 N4100, 8GB , 240GB SSD @420 still worth it?"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9644,"if you dont mind the fact that it used to be $370 for those specs, sure"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9645,Battery life will drop overnight for sure.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9645,But you should check if there is a feature to allow for other devices to charge over USB even when you off the laptop.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9645,"This is one of the features that will drain battery real quick, and generally on by default."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9646,"Is that price after coupon discounts, i.e. store and credit card discount?"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9646,"Last I saw yesterday, if you have a HSBC card, you can apply the 40 off 400 to get it to 400 bucks."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9646,"For 400 to 420, I think it is still a decent buy, though I agree after seeing the sub 400 bucks pricing previously, its hard for me to buy it above 400 bucks."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9647,"While the Ryzen chip is not the latest and greatest, it is still a very good processor for the price."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9647,"At 600 to 700  bucks, you can only get a laptop with very low end specs if you go for the bigger brands."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9647,"In any case, I pray that you can get a stable job soon."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9648,"ChuWi HeroPro 14"" N4000,8G/256GB @ $369 b4 vouchers @ Lazada."

MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9649,I also wish all bros in the forum to stay healthy and safe ya.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9650,"While the price is good, do note that N4000 is dual core, while N4100 is quad core."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9650,"So while its cheaper, it can be quite a bit slower."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9651,I actually gotten 329 for Acer and Lenovo with the flash sale and educator but fiancée want something powerful enough to do all the 3 things simultaneously

MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9655,Next will be the keyboard layout and the key travel for typing
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9655,but that I cant comment as I dont any to compare
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9655,As for specs 8Gb and ssd is good combo.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9656,OT a bit since we are on this brand.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9656,"anyone using their
?"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9656,"review looks ok,"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9656,wanna try
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9657,Thank you!
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9657,Hopefully it is compatible with additional ram
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9658,"Hi, sorry for late reply, I got the laptop at $634 excluding the $15 discount."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9658,I opt for 16GB Ram and 480GB SSD.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9659,"I will pay up to $700 for an Atom-powered Chinese laptop that uses a metal body, ships with at least 8GB of memory and a 256GB stick of socketed M.2 2280 SSD, and has a backlit keyboard."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9659,Everything else in that price range by big name OEMs are either using 4GB memory with crappy eMMCs and weak plastic bodies with lousy keyboards.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9659,The Chinese OEMs are catering to a market niche here.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9660,So far from a tear down video there are 2 dim slots
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9660,just Donno
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9660,my 8Gb comes in single channel or will they give 2x4
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9660,there is one m.2 nvme slot and sata 2.5 slot
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9660,That where I got conflicting youtube
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9660,some showed the laptop came with sata 2.5 some showed its has nvme
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9660,but since Lazada ad said it has pcie ssd
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9660,I presume is nvme
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9660,so sata slot will be empty for spare we when it has ssd + hdd config
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9661,700 bucks is too much for the specs you listed actually.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9661,"In this case, the Maibenben laptop is almost matching your requirement at around 400 bucks after discounts in the recent tech sale."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9661,I think its only missing the backlit keyboard.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9661,"M.2 SSD, you can easily get a decent 256GB at close to 100 bucks."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9662,The drive doesn't really matter actually.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9662,"If it comes with NVME, then just get a 2.5 inch SSD if you need more storage, vice versa."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9662,I don't think it will make any  difference in day to day usage whether the OS is on the NVME or SATA SSD.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9662,"NVME is really just good when it comes to sequential transfer rates, and there is no tangible benefits when it comes to OS boot up and app start up times."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9663,700 for an Atom laptop?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9663,I'll pass 🤣
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9664,"Gotten the laptop 527 but is reasonable for the price, sound nah, screen surprising very good and crisp and sharp with good Color and wide viewing angle."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9664,"Keyboard tactile but non mechanical,"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9664,"slight wobbly but not mushy, very good to type."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9664,Track pack smooth feeling and big but out of the box too high sensitive.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9664,My unit like many bro unable to activate
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9664,but I dont bother gotten a pro key for 10 bucks during flash sale.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9664,The m.2 drive is not nvme is WD green m.2 drive identified by the WD dashboard software.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9664,Donno is the ram or the drive a lot of stuttering.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9664,Will be putting in my spare Zotac mlc 240gb drive.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9664,Then native drive came in 106Gb x 2 partition had to use gpart to delete the 2nd part and stretch the c part to full.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9665,Actually is not bad for general useage.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9665,Good thing is battery can last very long.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9666,im getting 8.5h every day.

MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9671,JINMAI 6  13.3
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9671,All using intel N4100 Quad core processor
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9671,I'm still undecided.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9671,Understand that mbb has one year local warranty while the other 2 you have to send it back to China?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9671,thanks for advice

MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9672,"So far from Lazada I dont see much good review of chuwi though youtube many ppl praising teclast good but any service centre in sg, at least maibenben has a service centre"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9672,is the far west of Singapore.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9672,Though I must say my 2500U not as powerful as expected but your n4100 should be below that.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9672,N4100 is iris pro?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9672,Also for the 2500U for a 8Gb model dual channel only 5.9 gb usable not enough for whatsapp gmail Fb game youtube
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9672,all active at once.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9672,Hence suggest a higher 12 or 16gb model.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9672,"Also the WD green ssd is not a true nvme is only m.2 format and is SLOW, I will be putting my zotac mlc 240gb inside it which is much faster than the WD green SSD."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9672,Also the original SSD Donno why for a 240 gb still partitioned into 2 112GB portions I have to use g part to del the 2nd partition and
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9672,extend the c partition to full.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9672,So if you dont want hassle just get the 480gb
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9672,at least you have 2x 224gb.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9672,Also I assume 480gb will perform better than 240gb SSD
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9673,chuwi always have battery issue.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9673,teclast have qc issue.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9673,if you dont mind can return easily buy
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9674,Maibenben is China brand apparently with Singapore agent.

MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9702,Wow! Props!
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9702,You collect notebooks?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9703,nope.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9703,i sell away the ones i dont use.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9704,It is a shame the prices have been creeping up for the Maibenben laptops.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9704,I have not gotten 1 myself to try since I already have a laptop.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9704,But I recently got the ZiMai 12.5 inch portable monitor from them in the mid year sale @
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9704,"99 bucks after discounts, and I am impressed by the quality."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9704,"While I don't have any equipment to measure the brightness and color accuracy, the supposed Sharp IGZO screen is almost as good as the MSI monitor I am using that cost 6 to 7 times the price."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9704,"Visually, the color and brightness is good."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9704,"Monitor is thin and light, HDMI and Type C connects are firm, and no visible backlight bleeding."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9704,"As compared to the Anmite 15.6 inch 4K portable monitor I purchased a year back, backlight bleeding is quite obvious, and the monitor flickers frequently."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9704,"My only complain will be the buttons which are flushed with the chassis and thus, difficult to locate and press."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9704,"Because of the light weight, it makes pressing the buttons even harder."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9704,Overall very pleased to recommend it.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9704,12.5 inch works for me but is actually quite small.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9704,"I was considering the 13.3 version, but not willing to pay extra 20 bucks for a 0.8 inch increase in size."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9704,Moreover some reviews there seems to point to some issues with the screen.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,"Ok update,"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,I have updated my 2x4GB 5.9GB usable Samsung 2666 sodimm with 2x8GB 13.9GB usable Crucial 2666 sodimm.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,But sets works in dual channel but
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,one thing I use cpuz to check out the settings of the rams.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,"For the crucial it recognised 2666 but the freq its using hovers between 400 and 1,193"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,so = 2386 not reaching the 2666 and the timing corresponding to the tighter timing at 2333.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,"But becos now due to 13.9GB available, my fiancée usage does not exceed that amount hence no page fault"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,ie No usage of virtual page file is needed which makes its smooth.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,Also I have added in an Zotac premium mlc 240GB sata 3 SSD.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,And clone the is over and ran crystal mark.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,The Zotacs crystal mark is 1.5x of the WD green m.2 sata that came with the laptop.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,So relegated the WD green to data storage.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,So learning point: maybe for ram upgrading try to buy back Samsung 2666 sodimm modules.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,Definitely swab out the WD green
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,and I saw other even worse not getting a international brand but maybe better performance?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,Ssd.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,"But nonetheless for the pricing though I didnt get it at its cheapest still very competent laptop for multimedia, Facebook gaming, sch, and biz 15.6 inch laptop"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,,,9705,And I must say the screen is even better than my office assigned IBM Lenovo thinkpad
