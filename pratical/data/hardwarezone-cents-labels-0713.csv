XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,46,,,,,,,A,"Sure, the up to 5+ Ghz sounds amazing, but the caveat is that if it can sustain closer to the boost and not the base, yes.",1,150
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,46,,,,,,,A,I rather be realistic and look at the base clock to decide which one is the better solution.,1,151

XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,48,,,,,,,A,"It is clear that if you really wanna push Intel to 5Ghz, you need a LOT of power consumption.",1,161
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,48,,,,,,,A,"In such case, most Oem brands out there locked the Intel chip power consumption so that it doesnt overheat.",1,162
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,48,,,,,,,A,"And to further make sure it doesnt degrade performance further, they have to take extra measures to put more copper pipes.",1,163

XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,49,,,,,,,A,"Generally, they will reuse the same cooling solution.",1,170
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,49,,,,,,,A,Hopefully they improve on it though.,1,171
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,50,,,,,,,A,What annoys me the most is these laptop manufacturer that charges you 3 to 4,1,172

XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,52,,,,,,,A,A vapor chamber from my understanding please correct me if I am wrong is almost like a big and flat version of a heatpipe.,1,181

XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,57,,,,,,,A,Play games of course temperature will shoot up mah,1,203
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,57,,,,,,,A,But the below review said otherwise,1,204
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,57,,,,,,,X,Quote,1,205
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,57,P,,,,,,,"What is super impressive, however, is that there is virtually no heat that transfers up to the keyboard or trackpad.",1,206
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,57,,,,,,,A,"Now, while the bottom of the trackpad does warm up quite a bit when it's working hard, the keyboard feels just as cool after 8 hours as it does when we first open the laptop up at the beginning of the day.",1,207
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,57,,,,,,,X,Unquote,1,208
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,58,,,,,,,A,I think this review gives you a better perspective of the cooling solution and the thermals of the XPS 13.,1,209

XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,59,,,,,,,A,Notebook coolers may be effective if there are more vents below.,1,213
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,59,,,,,,,A,"So says this review,",1,214
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,59,,,,,,,A,But most laptops provide limited vents below.,1,215
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,59,,,,,,,A,"Of course the downside of having more vents is that water might get in if you spill it on the table, not to mention it will get more dusty.",1,216
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,59,,,,,,,A,The vents will also likely get blocked if someone uses it on the lap or bed.,1,217
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,60,,,,,,N,,lol as usual singapore prices are a total joke.,1,218

XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,61,,,,,,,A,That's why I was asking him whether he's always playing games on his laps.,1,221
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,61,,,,,,,A,"If gaming, and given such a small form factor as the XPS 13, then the temperature will definitely shoot up as expected.",1,222
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,62,,,,,,,A,I've had an XPS 13 2-in-1  for about 6 months.,1,223
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,62,,,,,,,A,"Since I needed 32 GB of ram, they only offered the 4K option.",1,224

XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,62,,,,P,,,,But I love the weight and the fact that it supports active stylus.,1,226
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,63,,,,,,,A,Because US base model is an i5/8gb/256/iGPU.,1,227
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,63,,,,,,,A,While ours starts at i7/16/512/1650ti,1,228
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,64,,,,,,,A,"Gaming wise, I am pretty sure people won't leave the laptop on their laps.",1,229
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,64,,,,,,,A,"Not just because it gets hot, but you need a mouse in most cases.",1,230
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,64,,,,,,,A,"For productive work, it is possible it will be used on a lap.",1,231
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,64,,,,,,,A,"So if say someone is doing some video encoding, it is a possible scenario.",1,232
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,64,,,,,,,A,"In any case, because of the slim form factor, it will not be able to keep the device cool.",1,233
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,64,N,,,,,,,"Based on my observation meddling with my E485 back then, the twin slim heatpipe became quite hot within a second even with light load.",1,234
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,64,N,,,,,,,"Under sustained load, the heatpipes get really hot and because the heatpipes are so close to the base, it is not ideal to leave the laptop on the lap.",1,235
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,64,,,,,,,A,"So nowadays, we can't call it a laptop anymore.",1,236
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,65,,,,,,,A,Let's hope dell does a decent job..,1,237
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,65,,,,,,,A,if not its really gonna be a white elephant.,1,238

XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,67,,,,,N,,,For 4K screen the battery life is always tough on the battery regardless of the laptop size.,1,243
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,67,,,,,,,,I believe in this case you chose 32GB RAM over battery life with 4K,1,244
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,68,,,,,,,A,4.5 to 5 K easily.,1,245
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,68,,,,,,,A,I'll wait for Tiger Lake and see,1,246
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,69,,,,,,,A,"I think there should only be Tiger Lake U coming in the later part of this year, which is capped at 4 cores improved CPU architecture and with Xe graphics on 10nm.",1,247
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,69,,,,,,,A,"Desktop version of Tiger Lake still runs on 14nm, which means there is a possibility that the 35W/45W chips may also be on 14nm.",1,248
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,70,,,,,,,A,Tiger Lake-H with 8C/16T would be nice just like the newly released Comet Lake-H in the DELL 15 & 17 2020 laptops,1,249
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,71,,,,,,,A,I have a feeling the H series will be based on 14nm.,1,250
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,71,,,,,,,A,"At this point, 10nm is clearly not ready for high power processors,",1,251
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,71,,,,,,,A,i.e. anything more than 28W.,1,252
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,71,,,,,,,A,The reason why I said this is based on observations.,1,253
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,71,,,,,,,A,"If 10nm is doing well, I don't see why they will backport Rocket Lake for desktop to 14nm.",1,254
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,71,,,,,,,A,"Also for the near future product stack, 10nm is always used only for the U series chips.",1,255
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,71,,,,,,,A,"Alder Lake will use 10nm, but rumored to have 8 big cores and 8 small cores, which is a regression from the current 10 big cores.",1,256
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,71,,,,,,,A,"I am expecting good IPC gains from this new chip, but I suspect they lose too much clockspeed if they choose 10nm over 14nm, and therefore, regression in performance.",1,257
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,71,,,,,,,A,"If that is the case, then this Tiger Lake H is going to run hot as well due to a highly clocked 14nm chip.",1,258

Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,Runnings,1,473
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,"Sure things, I'll list them down below Source:",1,474
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,X,Pros:,1,475
Chromebook,148,,,,,,P,,Price: The majority of Chromebooks cost significantly less than your average laptop.,1,476
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,Chromebooks can be had for as little as $200 with mid-range models in the $300-400 range.,1,477
Chromebook,148,P,,,,,,,Speed: Chromebooks can power on and be ready to use in around eight seconds.,1,478
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,They can do this because of their SSD hard drives and the lightweight Chrome OS.,1,479
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,Battery: Expect to get six hours or more from the battery on an average Chromebook.,1,480
Chromebook,148,,,,,P,,,Some even claim as much as 13 hours.,1,481
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,This is often more than you might get on a standard Windows laptops.,1,482
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,X,Sync,1,483
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,: Chromebooks sync all your apps and passwords with Chrome browsers on other computers.,1,484
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,"So, if you use the Chrome browser at work, or on another home computer, your bookmarks and other preferences will automatically sync to your Chromebook.",1,485
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,X,Cloud Storage,1,486
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,: You get 100GB of Google Drive storage free for two years with all new Chromebooks.,1,487
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,P,This is a huge amount of space.,1,488
Chromebook,148,,,,,,P,,"Comparable service from Dropbox, OneDrive or Box would cost significant money.",1,489
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,X,Updates:,1,490
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,"Chromebooks update themselves silently, automatically, and in the background.",1,491
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,"So, your device is always up to date and works just the way you need it to which in turn helps with the security.",1,492
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,X,Weight,1,493
Chromebook,148,,,,P,,,,": This varies, but most Chromebooks are lightweight devices that are portable and easy to carry with you when you need them.",1,494
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,Android Apps: Google have announced that you will soon be able to run Android apps on your Chromebook.,1,495
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,This merging of Chrome OS and Android enhances the functionality of a Chromebook.,1,496
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,"It means you can use Android apps by Adobe, Microsoft and others to play games, create and edit files, or play music and movies.",1,497
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,X,Cons:,1,498
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,N,"Office: If you are married to Microsoft Office products, a Chromebook is not for you.",1,499
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,Google encourages you to use its own free online suite of Office-like services.,1,500
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,N,"Many of these services are comparable to components of Microsoft Office, but they do lack features that you may have come to rely on.",1,501
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,N,"Although you can use the Android version of Office apps, they lack some of the full functionality in their desktop equivalents.",1,502
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,X,Storage:,1,503
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,N,Chromebooks typically only have 32GB of on-board storage.,1,504
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,Limiting storage helps keep the price down because component costs are cheaper.,1,505
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,"Google wants you to store your data in the cloud, and that is why it often includes 100GB of online storage for free with new Chrombooks.",1,506
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,N,"Printing: You can print on a Chromebook without too much difficulty, but depending on the printer you have, it might not be as easy as it used to be, because you are required to use Google Cloud Print.",1,507
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,X,Compatibility,1,508
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,: There is no doubt about it.,1,509
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,Windows is the most widely used desktop operating system in existence today.,1,510
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,"As such, you will find no shortage of apps and accessories to use with a Windows PC.",1,511
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,N,A Chromebook can be more limited in this regard.,1,512
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,"It has a growing library of software applications, and can be used with a wide variety of accessories, but Windows machines still win in the battle for compatibility.",1,513
Chromebook,148,,,,,,,A,Hope this helps.,1,514

Chromebook,149,,,,,,,A,Will check through,1,516

Chromebook,150,,,,,,,A,How about this Thread name: [Official] Chromebook SG,1,520
Chromebook,151,,,,,,,A,You are most welcome,1,521
Chromebook,151,,,,,,,P,Looks good on my end.,1,522
Chromebook,151,,,,,,,A,Let me know if you see the changes on your side.,1,523
Chromebook,151,,,,,,,A,"On a side note, coincidentally, I was looking at the reviews of the Samsung Chromebook Pro over the weekends.",1,524
Chromebook,151,,,,,,,A,It's currently in beta phase & will be released probably Apr.,1,525
Chromebook,151,,,,,,,P,Looks promising with the included S-pen!,1,526
Chromebook,151,,,,,,,N,However some reviewers said that Android apps were unusable / stuttery at best.,1,527
Chromebook,151,,,,,,,A,What are your opinions on it?,1,528
Chromebook,152,,,,,,,A,Oh... Samsung Chromebook Plus is available already.,1,529
Chromebook,152,,,,,,,A,But I would hold for Samsung Chromebook Pro...,1,530
Chromebook,153,,,,,,,A,"Btw, where to get the chromebooks..?",1,531
Chromebook,153,,,,,,,A,I mean I don't see them on retail..,1,532
Chromebook,154,,,,,,,A,Generally not sold in Singapore.,1,533
Chromebook,154,,,,,,,A,Courts used to sell them :O,1,534
Chromebook,154,,,,,,,A,Would have to be purchased online via Amazon / Ebay etc.,1,535
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,X,@Intrinion,1,536
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,"Yup, as mention it's in beta hence not ready for the general usage.",1,537
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,From what i gathered,1,538
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,it's the most likely due to different cpu that is used.,1,539
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,"In general, most Chromebook is using x86/intel CPU chipset and most android is using ARM chipset.",1,540
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,This led to the Android apps being optimised heavily on ARM processing.,1,541
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,Past Android devices running on Intel chipset has not received much positive feedback and led to manufacturer dropping the support for the chipset.,1,542
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,However if the merging of Chromebook and Android Play store,1,543
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,I believe Google will step up the development of it.,1,544
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,P,"There's few comments on the reddit thread that general usage of Android Apps is quite okay, what's is needed is to not set a high standard of expectation of it I.e. Running as smooth as an Android phone for now Especially games.",1,545
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,X,@Wyvern8,1,546
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,Sadly it's the same everywhere except US.,1,547
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,Due to the low demand for the device everywhere,1,548
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,it's quite hard to find them locally.,1,549
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,I did see ASUS selling their Chromebox/Chromebit Forget which one here in last year,1,550
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,but it's not what I wanted,1,551
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,and the specs is quite low lowest end model which result in less sales and then less incentive for companies to bring them in A vicious cycle.,1,552
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,With the government tender,1,553
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,i hope it might pick up interest and pace.,1,554
Chromebook,155,,,,,,N,,Also another thing is that the Chromebook here are overpriced.,1,555
Chromebook,155,,,,,,N,,The specs they've and the prices they've just don't match.,1,556
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,I can get better deals on Amazon and with shipping,1,557
Chromebook,155,,,,,,,A,it's sometime still better.,1,558
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,A,Cuz of the profit margin that is why retailers don't carry Chromebooks.,1,559
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,A,"However Education sector, some schools are using Chromebooks.",2,560
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,A,for lessons already.,2,560
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,A,"It has been a while already, if you guys really want comments about",1,561
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,A,Chromebooks can ask me also.,1,562

Chromebook,156,,,,,,P,,since they are cost effective.,3,563
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,A,for students to do homework and do learning.,3,563
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,N,However not all environment permit full access to Playstore.,2,564
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,N,featuers and items thus it is one major challenge.,2,564
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,A,The purchase was the Intel reference based chromebook.,1,565
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,A,Cost wise,1,566
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,A,"I cannot disclosed cuz consumer, education and.",2,567
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,A,commercial pricing varies.,2,567
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,A,"Yes there are local distributor for Chromebooks, however I am not sure",1,568
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,A,do they sell to consumer or not.,1,569
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,A,You can Google for them and send a email to them,1,570
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,A,but they mainly sell to schools only.,1,571
Chromebook,156,,,,,,,A,Hope this hopes.,1,572
Chromebook,157,,,,,,,A,i had a budget samsung chromebook the one using the arm chip way back,1,573
Chromebook,157,,,,,,,P,and i think it's great for what it is a machine with just a browser..,1,574
Chromebook,157,,,,,,,P,the latest 2017 chromebooks look great though....especially with direct Play Store integration.,1,575
Chromebook,157,,,,,,,A,like many stated here...,1,576
Chromebook,157,,,,,,,A,The Samsung Chromebook Pro and the Asus Chromebook Flip,1,577
Chromebook,157,,,,,,,A,C302a are both i am currently scouting...,1,578
Chromebook,157,,,,,,,A,it's too bad that there are still no official news on these items being available officially in singapore with official warranty.,1,579
Chromebook,157,,,,,,,A,"the old samsung chromebook, i had to import from Amazon US",1,580
Chromebook,158,,,,,,,A,MS Office are now available via Android apps.,1,581
Chromebook,158,,,,,,,A,"Also, the online office apps via MS Onedrive is also sufficient enough.",1,582
Chromebook,158,,,,,,,A,"Unless you are truly power excel users that requires spreadsheets with tens of thousands of cells or weird plugins, i reckon most ppl can just work with these version of Office or even Google Drive Sheets.",1,583
Chromebook,159,,,,,,,P,it make alot of sense for education sectors to use chromebook...,1,584
Chromebook,159,,,,,,,A,first they don't have to worry about security as chromebooks are locked down OS with just browser.,1,585
Chromebook,159,,,,,,,P,Even the Android Apps are sandboxed and easy to manage...,1,586

Huawei Matebook X Pro,462,,,,,,,,The reason for this is that I can kind of get the X1C at roughly the same price as the Matebook through my organisation at around 2k+.The upside,1,1947
Huawei Matebook X Pro,462,,,,,,,,is that lenovo has the warranty support for 3 years.,1,1948

Huawei Matebook X Pro,1092,,,,,,,,Expedited shipping.,1,3869
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1092,,,,,,,,"For units from Amazon, my guess is warranty claim if any is dealt with Amazon or Huawei USA, not Malaysia.",1,3870
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1093,,,,,,,,yes.,1,3871
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1093,,,,,,,,think huawei US would void it.,1,3872
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1093,,,,,,,,Very few laptop companies allowed such mods with warranty.,1,3873
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1093,,,,,,,,I had the laptop for two-three weeks before i did the mod.,1,3874
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1093,,,,,,,,So it was not giving me problems earlier,1,3875
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1093,,,,,,,,and i dont expect it to be later as well.,1,3876
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1093,N,,,,,,,i was not comfortable with the temp as the keyboard get pretty hot to touch near the screen.,1,3877
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1093,,,,,,,,Now it is warm when loaded which is fine for me as i have directed the heat toward the bottom cover.,1,3878
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1093,,,,,,,,I have to lift the back a little for airflow when using it.,1,3879
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1093,,,,,,,,I had tons of experience with PCs,1,3880
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1093,,,,,,,,but it was my first time with laptop.,1,3881
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1093,,,,,,,,So mileage might differ.,1,3882
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1093,,,,,,,,Just make sure you have all the equipment before doing the mod.,1,3883
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1094,,,,,,,,You can just undervolt it using Throttlestop.,1,3884
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1094,,,,,,,,"It helps a bit, I guess?",1,3885
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1094,,,,,,,,"Also, for those who have yet to get theirs, I can't over-emphasize how much I love my Matebook X Pro.",1,3886
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1094,,,,,,,,"My unit is on 8-9 hours a day, 5 days a week, since mid-August.",1,3887
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1094,,,,,,,,"So far, no issues whatsoever.",1,3888
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1094,,,,,,,,It's really worth every penny spent.,1,3889
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1094,,,,,,,,"Also, it needs mentioning that the dongle thingy that they provide is really solid.",1,3890
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1094,,,,,,,,"Most dongles can get quite hot over extended periods of use, but I haven't encountered anything like that with the included dongle.",1,3891
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1094,,,,,,,,"I have a second display via the dongle using VGA, which is on 8 hours a day as well.",1,3892
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1094,,,,,,,,"For me, since I do quite a fair bit of programming and simulation, I find that it really helps to get a laptop cooling pad even more so for the Matebook X Pro since it has a metal chassis.",1,3893
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1094,,,,,,,,Best $10 spent.,1,3894
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1095,,,,,,,,Dunno why throttlestop has been freezing my,1,3895

Huawei Matebook X Pro,1100,,,,,,,,Do note that the price on Amazon fluctuates a lot every other day.,1,3910
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1100,,,,,,,,Best to set up a camelcamelcamel.com price tracker and monitor.,1,3911
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1100,,,,,,,,For me I set it to notify if it drops below US1200 and pulled the trigger at $1199.,1,3912

Huawei Matebook X Pro,1108,,,,,,,,any matte screen protector to recommend?,1,3933
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1108,,,,,,,,the screen is pretty reflective in bright environment.,1,3934
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1109,,,,,,,,You can install it at Sim Lim Square.,1,3935
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1109,,,,,,,,That's where I installed mine.,1,3936
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1109,,,,,,,,"I don't really recall the shop number though, but I remember that it was 4th floor, and it was some corner shop.",1,3937
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1109,,,,,,,,"When I was asking around for laptop screen protector, the lady asked if I wanted clear or matte.",1,3938
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1109,,,,,,,,"They don't sell any pre-sized screen protector for our laptops, so they'll need to measure out and custom cut from a bigger piece.",1,3939
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1109,,,,,,,,Cost around 20+.,1,3940
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1110,,,,,,,,Does it affect the clarity of the screen?,1,3941
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1110,,,,,,,,like blurriness of the words.,1,3942

Huawei Matebook X Pro,1113,,,,,,,,Might want to consider tempered glass protector as well although the con is that its not going to be matte.,1,3948
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1113,,,,,,,,Read that the screen is quite sensitive.,1,3949
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1114,,,,,,,,I don't think tempered glass SP is advisable since that will mean you can't fully close the laptop.,1,3950
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1114,,,,,,,,How do I know this?,1,3951
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1114,,,,,,,A,"I am currently using those rubbery/jelly-like keyboard cover for the Matebook X Pro, which is super thin, and even then, when I open up my laptop every morning on my desk, I can see the prints of the square key-caps on my screen.",1,3952
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1114,,,,,,,,I don't carry my laptop around.,1,3953
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1114,,,,,,,,I only close my laptop lid every day before I leave my desk.,1,3954
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1114,,,,,,,,This is what leads me to believe that the Matebook X Pro actually closes quite flush with everything inside.,1,3955
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1114,,,,,,,A,"I imagine that if you have a tempered glass SP, it might either hurt the screen since tempered glass SPs are generally thicker than plastic/film SPs, or the keyboard; especially so if you carry your laptop around when closed.",1,3956

Huawei Matebook X Pro,1118,,,,,,,,"If you're using the included charger, make sure you plug the usb-c cable properly into the charging brick.",1,3970
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1118,,,,,,,,There needs to be a click-type of feeling at the end.,1,3971

Huawei Matebook X Pro,1122,,,,,,,,"If that's the case, then the Aukey charger is what's faulty, and not the Matebook X Pro..",1,3978
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1122,,,,,,,,"Another thing to try with the Aukey charger is to plug it into the laptop, turn on the charger and give it a couple seconds.",1,3979
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1122,,,,,,,,Sometimes it takes 5-10 seconds before it starts charging.,1,3980
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1123,,,,,,,,My one is still going strong.,1,3981

Huawei Matebook X Pro,1125,,,,,,,,Maybe not calibrated yet?,1,3990
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1125,,,,,,,,Drained it to 0 and full charge will give u more accurate reading,1,3991
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1125,,,,,,,,I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t really track the reading as I got 2 units of the xm powerbank and they were really cheap for what they are capable of.,1,3992
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1125,,,,,,,,When I bought it was about $50 from here,1,3993
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1125,,,,,,,,That being said I only charge my matebook x pro when it is below 20% and when it is done I can get near to full bar,1,3994

Lenovo Ideapad L340,1265,,,,,,,,I don't see it anywhere that mention ODD on the l340 gaming page.,1,4544
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1265,,,,,,,,Hmm yeah they should just put all the model there as L340 gaming  and not cause confusion to customers.,1,4545
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1265,,,,,,,,Anyway best to chat up with their agent for better clarification.,1,4546
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1265,,,,,,,,"There's not much to customise for laptop, especially if you still want to retain warranty by the manufacturer.",1,4547

Lenovo Ideapad L340,1270,,,,,,,,i7 core runs at higher performance and eats up more since it has 2 more core than the i5 though not at a noticeable rate but,1,4577
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1270,,,,,,,A,ideally if you're gaming this could make a really small slight difference.,1,4578

Lenovo Ideapad L340,1279,,,,,,,,Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT,1,4626
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1280,,,,,,,,thermal throttling basically mean that the cooling system of the laptop is not able to dissipate the heat generated by the components in the laptop and,1,4627
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1280,,,,,,,,the cpu/gpu gets so hot to the point where it runs at a lower clock speed in order to generate less heat and run cooler.,1,4628
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1280,,,,,,,,hence you are not able to get the full performance the laptop and its components can offer.,1,4629

Lenovo Ideapad L340,1409,,,,,,,,Actually what we need to do first when we receive the laptop ah?,1,5211
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1409,,,,,,,,I remember someone order before,1,5212
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1409,,,,,,,,and he said the battery need conditioning or something,1,5213
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1410,,,,,,,,I think one of our bros here have received quite long ago.,1,5214
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1410,,,,,,,,Wonder how is it now,1,5215
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,Oops....,1,5216
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,Ok so I am not an expert in this area.,1,5217
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,Moreover its my first gaming laptop.,1,5218
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,The good in short:,1,5219
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,,1,5220
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,P,,,,,,"- The blue keyboard back light is nice and I am glad we have 3 options to turn it off, dim it and make it bright.",1,5221
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,,1,5222
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,BUT the power mode has to be turned on to performance mode first else it will lag apparently.,1,5223
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,The bad:,1,5224
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,,1,5225
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,"- I emailed Lenovo several times asking them abt the ""Quiet"" and ""Quick"" mode because based on the website, it said its good for gaming and can be done by a simple ""flick"".",1,5226
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,Apparently alot of them cant really explain to me,1,5227
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,whats that.,1,5228
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,Almost all eventually told me its basically to configure the BIOS by adjusting the fan something like that.,1,5229
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,Read:,1,5230
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,,1,5231
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,"All the ports USB, USB-C, power etc are all on the non-traditional LEFT side of the laptop.",1,5232
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,So its abit weird or inconvenient.,1,5233
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,"Anymore questions you all have, let me know lor.",1,5234
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1411,,,,,,,,Thks.,1,5235
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1412,,,,,,,,Yeah usually it will be below 50% battery when you first receive it.,1,5236
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1412,,,,,,,,What i tend to do is to drain the battery finish even when i get my new phone then leave to charge it overnight,1,5237
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1412,,,,,,,,6-8hours.,1,5238
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1412,,,,,,,,I believe that is part of battery conditioning right?,1,5239
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1412,,,,,,,A,"I'll probably test around by doing both normal work and gaming, then i give both results to see how well is the laptop in terms of noise by the fan vents, keyboard feel etc.",1,5240
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1413,,,,,,,,Thank you bro for the insightful review.,1,5241
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1413,,,,,,,,Totally appreciate it too!,1,5242
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1413,,,,,,,,I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m kind of disturbed by,1,5243
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1413,,,,,,,,where is the work and quick mode that you are facing.,1,5244
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1413,,,,,,,,Maybe because my main reason of getting this laptop is able to switch around.,1,5245
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1413,,,,,,,,Or they didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t develop the software yet.,1,5246
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1414,,,,,,,,One of my reasons was also becauze,1,5247
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1414,,,,,,,,I thought I can switch around however all the customer services guys could only point me to the Bios configuration.,1,5248
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1414,,,,,,,,One of them was even worst.,1,5249
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1414,,,,,,,,"He told me its the button which is actually the switch to close/block the camera  because if you look at the Lenovo website, the pic beside this feature is actually  the camera pic.",1,5250
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1414,,,,,,,,He,1,5251
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1414,,,,,,,,Totally does not know his product at all.,1,5252
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1415,,,,,,,,I went to further research and found one of the review mentioned that Lenovo is still mysteriously brief about this mode but not yet confirm.,1,5253
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1415,,,,,,,,Maybe gotta wait lo..,1,5254
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1415,,,,,,,,"anyway I think if we use power saving mode, high chance the laptop using onboard graphic card than the own graphic card.",1,5255

Lenovo Ideapad L340,1420,,,,,,,,My son was playing Fortnite yesterday and he commented the laptop is getting hot.,1,5277
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1420,,,,,,,,So I think I need to get a proper fan system like what some commented in the last few posts.,1,5278
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1421,,,,,,,,Yes we shd.,1,5279
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1421,,,,,,,,I think we shd be asking the other regions' CSO too because the model was released much earlier in the US or UK,1,5280
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1421,,,,,,,,I think so I am surprised there is not much discussion or complains on the net for those regions.,1,5281
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1422,,,,,,,,Less than 3 hours is really quite little.,1,5282
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1422,,,,,P,,,They should have doubled the battery capacity to 90wh and idm paying slightly more for it,1,5283

Lenovo Ideapad L340,1423,,,,,,,,I was expecting somewhere 5-6 hrs on normal usage...,1,5290
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1423,,,,,,,,Is this on safe mode or performance mode?,1,5291
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1423,,,,,,,,Perhaps you have many programs running that makes it <3hrs?,1,5292

Lenovo Ideapad L340,1601,,,,,,,,gave me 15% immediately lol.,1,6081
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1602,,,,,,,,I came to know there are different department handling the chat.,1,6082
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1602,,,,,,,,One lady I spoke to cannot give discount and apparently she is from some invoice department.,1,6083
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1602,,,,,,,,"Another lady is able to give 10% and when I questioned her, she said she is from quotation dept hence can give discount",1,6084
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1602,,,,,,,,but the discount code will only last 10mins from the point she generates,1,6085

Lenovo Ideapad L340,1603,,,,,,,,Do we plug in all the time?,1,6088

Lenovo Ideapad L340,1608,,,,,,,,Very useful feature if you stay plugged in most of the time.,1,6108
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1609,,,,,,,,Played around with the laptop just now.,1,6109
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1609,,,,,,,,Cooling system is not bad but not the best.,1,6110
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1609,,,,,,,,"Room temp is ur avg SG temp, no aircon.",1,6111
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1609,,,,,,,,Idle at around 45-50 degrees and at 100% cpu usage its around 70-75 degrees with sustained clock speed of 2.9ghz.,1,6112
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1609,,,,,,,,Note that this CPU max clock speed is rated at 4.5ghz.,1,6113
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1609,,,,,,,,TDP is limited to 35w at 100% load instead of rated 45w.,1,6114
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1609,,,,,,,,Used XTU to undervolt the CPU and managed to achieve -0.160mv stable undervolt.,1,6115
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1609,,,,,,,,System crashed at -0.180mv,1,6116
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1609,,,,,,,,so -0.160 is pretty safe.,1,6117
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1609,,,,,,,,Cinebench R20 went from a score of 2100+ to 2500+ while CPU temps remains at 70-75 degrees.,1,6118
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1609,,,,,,,,Clock speed at load is increased to 3.1ghz.,1,6119
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1609,,,,,,,,I think its the best this laptop can do le.,1,6120
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1609,,,,,,,,All these is tested at max performance power profile with charger connected eith laptop at conservation mode.,1,6121
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1609,,,,,,,,Could have pushed it further if it has a more robust cooling solution.,1,6122
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1609,,,,,,,,Any pros in undervolting pls advice,1,6123
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1609,,,,,,,,haha!,1,6124
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1610,,,,,,,,Cool!,1,6125
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1610,,,,,,,,thank for testing the power of this laptop.,1,6126
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1610,,,,,,,,Yea the cooling system is quite average.,1,6127
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1610,,,,,,,,The vent at the bottom is what worries me alot,1,6128
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1610,N,,,,,,,and i don't really see it cooling down fast.,1,6129
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1610,,,,,,,,I think i might invest in a laptop stand rather than laptop cooler,1,6130
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1610,,,,,,,,cause,1,6131
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1610,,,,,,,,i'm bringing this laptop out more often than putting in one place.,1,6132
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1610,,,,,,,,Maybe find one in taobao haha.,1,6133
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1611,,,,,,,,The undervolt value differs for different CPUs.,1,6134
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1611,,,,,,,,Am able to reach -0.160mv for mine,1,6135
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1611,,,,,,,,but many online can only reach a stable -0.050mv for,1,6136
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1611,,,,,,,,their i7-9750H. Have to do trial and error.,1,6137
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1611,,,,,,,,Am looking for some foldable laptop stand to stick them to the underside of the laptop..,1,6138
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1611,,,,,,,,not sure if there are any!,1,6139
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1611,,,,,,,,Will probably do a test to see if raising it above the surface helps at all first,1,6140
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1611,,,,,,,,", cos for some laptops it does not have any difference at all tho, need to blow air in for it to have btr cooling.",1,6141
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1612,,,,,,,,I think that this laptop need to have more space on bottom for better air suction while top vent needs blow off,1,6142
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1612,,,,,,,,sideway leh... lol!,1,6143
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1613,P,,,,,,,"some real world testing, was rendering a video in premiere pro, its relatively fast and even though its not thermal throttling, the cpu is limited to 2.6ghz at full load at 75 degrees.",1,6144
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1613,,,,,,,N,not looking great.,1,6145
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1613,,,,,,,,"thats like 1.9ghz away from max clock speed of the i7-9750H, alot of wasted potential in this laptop.",1,6146
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1613,,,,,,,,"for people wanting to get the full potential out of this cpu, i would recommend spending a few hundred more to get one with a btr cooling solution",1,6147
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1614,,,,,,,,So this laptop have bad battery life and not so good cooling system?,1,6148
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1615,,,,,,,,i choose the 2280 SSD.,1,6149

Lenovo Ideapad L340,1615,,,,,,,,"Second Storage Selection	512GB M.2 2280 NVMe TLC",1,6151
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1616,,,,,,,,Can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t say it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s bad battery life when the battery cell capacity is small.,1,6152
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1616,,,,,,,,"When we talk about cooling system, it is when the laptop at peak performance, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s warm.",1,6153

Lenovo Ideapad L340,1617,,,,,,,,"Yeah, if only the battery capacity is like 90+wh :/ battery life is on par with other laptops of same specs having the same battery capacity.",1,6155
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1617,,,,,,,,"Yeap, laptop is warm at 100% load.",1,6156
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1617,,,,,,,,At full load the cooling system cannot keep up with the heat output as seen by the relatively low clock speeds.,1,6157
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1617,,,,,,,,"Wouldn't say its bad, its just insufficient and not effective.",1,6158
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1617,,,,,,,,"But at least they decrease the clock speeds to keep temps in check at abt 75 degrees, else the lifespan of the cpu will drop significantly.",1,6159
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1617,,,,,,,,"Bottom line is at least from my POV, if you want the cheapest laptop at this specs, this is the laptop to go.",1,6160
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1617,,,,,,,,"If you need the most power and is a hardcore gamer/editor that wants the most performance, go for others like Aftershock Forge, Legion, Dell G series etc that have better cooling solutions.",1,6161
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1617,,,,,,,,But be prepared to pay abt 1.5x to 2x the price for abt the same specs as the fully maxed out L340 Gaming,1,6162
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1618,,,,,,,,"Yes, when I set the brightness level to the lowest, it is totally dark.",1,6163
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1618,,,,,,,P,Don't see a light sensor on the L340 which in my opinion is very good.,1,6164
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1618,,,,,,,A,My old Lenovo has a light sensor which adjusts the brightness automatically.,1,6165
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1618,,,,,,,,Didn't like that and pasted a sticker over the sensor so the brightness won't fluctuate,1,6166

Lenovo Ideapad L340,1830,,,,,,,,Did you guys get your set online via Lenovo website or you guys think those retailers out there will beat website prices?,1,6948
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1831,,,,,,,,"This laptop is very new and up till now, none of the retailers are selling this yet.",1,6949
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1831,,,,,,,,"I guess if you want to customise your own configuration, go with the online configurator, which lets you max out everything.",1,6950

Lenovo Ideapad L340,1831,,,,,,,,Their online site is pretty good.,1,6952
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1831,,,,,,,,Most of us here got 15% discount from lenovo reps and another 9% from shopback.,1,6953
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1831,,,,,,,,"That's 24% off listed price unless they count the 9% off from the price with the 15% discount applied, then it will be a little lesser than 24%.",1,6954

Lenovo Ideapad L340,1850,,,,,,,,"However, this laptop has a battery issue which drains rather quickly even when doing normal work.",1,7033

Lenovo Thinkpad,2030,,,,,,,,Yes the HP Envy X360 as well as Probook/Elitebook.,1,7866
Lenovo Thinkpad,2030,,,,,,,,However not below $1k.,1,7867
Lenovo Thinkpad,2031,,,,,,,,"Heat problem or not, we will only know if we try it.",1,7868
Lenovo Thinkpad,2031,,,,,,,,This is running a 15W processor which I feel should not be a big concern with the thick chassis on this ThinkPad.,1,7869
Lenovo Thinkpad,2031,,,,,,,,"I think it is just a perception that if it is AMD, it will run hot.",1,7870
Lenovo Thinkpad,2031,,,,,,,,"To give you a little comparison, my Lenovo Miix 720 with a i5 7200U could hit over 80 degs under load.",1,7871

Lenovo Thinkpad,2032,N,,,,,,,5 2500U indicate inadequate cooling leading to throttling of processor under heavy load.,1,7873
Lenovo Thinkpad,2032,,,,,,,,Let's hope Lenovo has learnt the lesson and made necessary improvement on these new models.,1,7874
Lenovo Thinkpad,2033,,,,,,,,For those who assume AMD is hot.,1,7875
Lenovo Thinkpad,2033,,,,,,,,Do not based on the preception of Ideapad 720s as that one.,2,7876
Lenovo Thinkpad,2033,,,,,,,,is Lenovo lazy design.,2,7876

the temp under load can go as high as 80 degrees.",1,7881

Lenovo Thinkpad,2034,,,,,,,,but.,2,7883
Lenovo Thinkpad,2034,,,,,,,,it is 15Watt TDP.,2,7883
Lenovo Thinkpad,2034,N,,,,,,,Anyway for those who think AMD is slow and hot don't get it.,1,7884
Lenovo Thinkpad,2034,,,,,,,,Not citing AMD still have the issue if you are not comfortable.,2,7885
Lenovo Thinkpad,2034,,,,,,,,or confidential in AMD laptop than just get Intel.,2,7885
Lenovo Thinkpad,2034,,,,,,,,Most Intel laptop comes with Intel UHD and optional graphics.,2,7886
Lenovo Thinkpad,2034,,,,,,,,like Geforce/Radeon which means more $.,2,7886
Lenovo Thinkpad,2034,,,,,,,,AMD Ryzen based laptop is one chip with decent CPU and Vega graphics.,1,7887
Lenovo Thinkpad,2034,,,,,,,,On default for AMD laptop will be Vega while Intel is the crappy UHD.,1,7888
Lenovo Thinkpad,2034,,,,,,,,That is why most laptop for Intel usually comes with discrete graphic.,2,7889
Lenovo Thinkpad,2034,,,,,,,,as Intel UHD is CMI.,2,7889
Lenovo Thinkpad,2034,,,,,,,,Intel UHD have to be enabled to save power especially on battery.,1,7890
Lenovo Thinkpad,2035,,,,,,,,Just ordered one @ $815.03 this morning for my daughter as her Acer Aspire 5 is getting old and we would not want to have sudden failure in notebook interrupting her course work.,1,7891
Lenovo Thinkpad,2035,,,,,,,,"Chosen 2x4GB ram, 65W charger and Win10 Home since her don't play games and her course work has no video editing, should not be too taxing on memory and processing power.",1,7892
Lenovo Thinkpad,2035,,,,,,,,Just hope everything goes well.,1,7893
Lenovo Thinkpad,2036,,,,,,,,"I've not seen the chassis used by the ThinkPad, but realistically, any thin profile laptops tend to suffer from throttling.",1,7894
Lenovo Thinkpad,2036,,,,,,,,It is just a matter of how much it gets throttled.,1,7895
Lenovo Thinkpad,2036,,,,,,,,The same applies to Intel's 15W processors too.,1,7896
Lenovo Thinkpad,2036,,,,,,,,"Case in point, my Lenovo Miix 720.",1,7897
Lenovo Thinkpad,2036,,,,,,,,"Even assuming that thermals is not the issue, 15W processors will still throttle because of the low power limit.",1,7898
Lenovo Thinkpad,2036,,,,,,,,This is especially the case when you are gaming because both the CPU and GPU are under load.,1,7899
Lenovo Thinkpad,2037,,,,,,,,One thing do take note is after you got the unit.,1,7900
Lenovo Thinkpad,2037,,,,,,,,Do a fresh install of the OS than load all the driver properly.,1,7901
Lenovo Thinkpad,2037,,,,,,,A,Out of the box OS usually are slow and bloated with junks.,1,7902
Lenovo Thinkpad,2038,,,,,,,,I don't do this.,1,7903
Lenovo Thinkpad,2038,,,,,,,,"For me, I will just go in an remove all the bloatware that I don't use and run a registry cleaner, e.g. CCleaner.",1,7904

Lenovo Thinkpad,2038,,,,,,,A,"Nowadays with SSDs, slowness due to too many apps is not that apparent as those mechanical drive days where I will always format my PC/ laptops annually to spur it back to a ""speedy"" state.",1,7906

Lenovo Thinkpad,2097,,,,,,,,"I think if there is no warranty seal, it may not be a problem.",1,8064

Lenovo Thinkpad,2097,,,,,,,,"If the laptop is faulty, I just slap the old drive back and bring it back for repairs.",1,8066
Lenovo Thinkpad,2098,,,,,,,,I think opting for a 512gb SSD is a better option than choosing 16gb ram,1,8067
Lenovo Thinkpad,2099,,,,,,,,Both have their pros and cons.,1,8068
Lenovo Thinkpad,2099,,,,,,,,"But the good thing is whatever you did not upgrade at the point of purchase, you can upgrade later since both hard disk and RAM appears to be user upgradeable.",1,8069

Lenovo Thinkpad,2102,,,,,,,,"While this is indeed something to consider, I believe the system nowadays may not need a matched pair to run dual channel.",1,8073
Lenovo Thinkpad,2102,,,,,,,,At least in 1 of the instance I noticed it was running dual channel even without a matching pair.,1,8074
Lenovo Thinkpad,2102,,,,,,,,"For me, I will go for the ram upgrade because +110 is quite a good price.",1,8075
Lenovo Thinkpad,2103,,,,,,,,"If it is me, I will just:

Lenovo Thinkpad,2104,,,,,,,,"Dual channel is like raid 0, double the speed but absolutely require 2 stick of ram to work together.",1,8082

Lenovo Thinkpad,2104,,,,,,,,"If your default configuration is 8gb, it make sense to set it as dual 4gb to maximise the igp.",1,8084
Lenovo Thinkpad,2104,,,,,,,,"When you switch one of the ram stick to 8 gb, 4gb + 4gb will run as dual channel while the last 4gb will run as single channel.",1,8085
Lenovo Thinkpad,2104,,,,,,,,This may affect the igp performance if it has to switch to single channel part of the time.,1,8086
Lenovo Thinkpad,2104,,,,,,,,"Single channel, the speed is reduced by half.",1,8087
Lenovo Thinkpad,2104,,,,,,,,The ram speeds advertised is based on dual channel.,1,8088
Lenovo Thinkpad,2104,,,,,,,,Check CPUz for your system ram speed.,1,8089
Lenovo Thinkpad,2105,,,,,,,,"A 256gb will typically start to display errors at the limit of its write cycle, which is at about 350TB written data.",1,8090
Lenovo Thinkpad,2105,,,,,,,,That means 3 years to 4 years of use if you rewrite your ssd with 256gb every single day.,1,8091
Lenovo Thinkpad,2105,,,,,,,,"For a 512gb, it is double the amount.",1,8092
Lenovo Thinkpad,2105,P,,,,,,,Also a 512gb will be faster than a 256gb  theoretically.,1,8093
Lenovo Thinkpad,2105,,,,,,,,"To avoid ssd damage, it is recommended to reduce page file usage and use solely the ram.",1,8094
Lenovo Thinkpad,2105,,,,,,,,Don't worry about ssd outliving your systems unless you are swapping huge amount of memory every second.,1,8095

Lenovo Thinkpad,2134,,,,,,,,Only one which can schedule specific window and date in my experience is DHL.,1,8169
Lenovo Thinkpad,2135,,,,,,,,We can expect idle battery life to be less than Intel as they are still not as efficient at lower clock rates.,1,8170

Lenovo Thinkpad,2359,,,,,,,,Can show link?,1,9014
Lenovo Thinkpad,2359,,,,,,,,I'm shocked too,1,9015
Lenovo Thinkpad,2360,,,,,,,,Many reasons.,1,9016
Lenovo Thinkpad,2360,,,,,,,,Mainly the comparison is between top end 2013 2Ghz,1,9017
Lenovo Thinkpad,2360,,,,,,,,"4C/8T Intel vs current 2Ghz or 2.2 Ghz 4C/8T AMD not sure which Ryzen you refer, but give you benefit of doubt it is not the lowest end 4C/4T model.",1,9018
Lenovo Thinkpad,2360,,,,,,,,Intel's IPC didn't go up much over the years from 4xxx to 7xxx.,1,9019
Lenovo Thinkpad,2360,,,,,,,,So performance difference is not going to be ground-breaking.,1,9020
Lenovo Thinkpad,2360,,,,,,,,Look instead at the TDP.,1,9021
Lenovo Thinkpad,2360,,,,,,,,"i7-4750 is rated at 47Watt while Ryzen 2500U/2700U is rated at 15W. Benchmark per watt, is an improvement.",1,9022
Lenovo Thinkpad,2360,,,,,,,,Ryzen integrated Vega graphics is also a hugh improvement over Iris Pro in i7-4750hq.,1,9023
Lenovo Thinkpad,2360,,,,,,,,"Whereas, if you can afford the latest, MacBook Pro 13"", it is going to have Core i7-8559U quad-core: This has a base frequency of 2.7 and Turbo Boosts up to 4.5 GHz and is rated up to 28W. Going to trash Ryzen",1,9024

Lenovo Thinkpad,2361,,,,,,,,you will probably yield a different result.,1,9042

Lenovo Thinkpad,2362,,,,,,,,"The Vega graphics core can play most games, but in lower settings, of course.",1,9044

Lenovo Thinkpad,2613,,,,,,,,"It seems like it'll cost maybe $200 more than the E485 for an equivalent spec, but for a much better chassis and also expandable external battery!.",1,9864
Lenovo Thinkpad,2613,,,,,,,,"If you care about that, but you still don't want to pay the Intel tax, then maybe it is worth waiting for.",1,9865
Lenovo Thinkpad,2613,,,,,,,,Otherwise you can just get the T480s.,1,9866

Lenovo Thinkpad,2613,,,,,,,,"Linux driver support, at least on those Linux-certified ThinkPads, is generally excellent.",1,9868
Lenovo Thinkpad,2613,,,,,,,,Device power management is now on par with Windows.,1,9869
Lenovo Thinkpad,2613,,,,,,,,"Because of that, on my albeit Intel laptop Windows 10 has never given me better battery life than Linux, simply because of all the things running in the background on W10.",1,9870
Lenovo Thinkpad,2613,,,,,,,,"This is only for the X1C6, which prior to the recent update did not expose the S3 state in its DSDT only S0i3, causing high sleep power drain in Linux.",1,9871
Lenovo Thinkpad,2613,,,,,,,,No other ThinkPad does that.,1,9872
Lenovo Thinkpad,2613,,,,,,,,"Linux should be able to go into S3 sleep without an issue on the E{4,5}85.",1,9873
Lenovo Thinkpad,2613,,,,,,,,"In fact the S0ix states are an Intel thing, so these AMD computers will never have that issue.",1,9874
Lenovo Thinkpad,2614,,,,,,,,I think e480 has a different construction than the e485/e585.,1,9875
Lenovo Thinkpad,2614,,N,,,,,,"A few factors Mil-spec, lack of backlit keyboard compatibility, etc.",1,9876
Lenovo Thinkpad,2614,,,,,,,,point to the e485/585 sharing the same construction as the older models e475/,1,9877
Lenovo Thinkpad,2614,,,,,,,,e470 instead.,1,9878
Lenovo Thinkpad,2614,,,,,,,,"e480 build quality was improved, though it is still nowhere near the other more premium series.",1,9879
Lenovo Thinkpad,2614,,,,,,,,"Also, I doubt A485 would be just $200 more if it was, that would be incredible value for money!.",1,9880
Lenovo Thinkpad,2614,,,,,,,,UK pricing puts the starting price at 240 pounds more than the e485.,1,9881
Lenovo Thinkpad,2614,,,,,,,,Price difference is likely to be around $500.,1,9882

Lenovo Thinkpad,2621,,,,,,,,Vs smooth touch on the e480.,1,9936
Lenovo Thinkpad,2621,,,,,,,,So there's some difference in some of the materials at least,1,9937
Lenovo Thinkpad,2622,,,,,,,,Just got this laptop last week.,1,9938
Lenovo Thinkpad,2622,,,,,,,,I got BSOD while watching Youtube.,1,9939
Lenovo Thinkpad,2622,,,,,,,,Happened a few times already.,1,9940
Lenovo Thinkpad,2622,,,,,,,,The error is VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE ATIKMPAG.SYS.,1,9941
Lenovo Thinkpad,2622,,,,,,,,I tried to download the graphics drivers from lenovo website,1,9942
Lenovo Thinkpad,2622,,,,,,,,but it says the driver is already the latest.,1,9943
Lenovo Thinkpad,2622,,,,,,,,Any idea how to solve this problem?,1,9944
Lenovo Thinkpad,2623,,,,,,,,E585 seems to be problem free.,1,9945
Lenovo Thinkpad,2623,,,,,,,A,"Heng, but those who want good and light quality should get the X series or want good quality get the T series.",1,9946
Lenovo Thinkpad,2623,,,,,,,,I get this mainly for the specs over price.,1,9947
Lenovo Thinkpad,2624,,,,,,,,Yeah mine is pointing to gpu drivers issues as well.,1,9948
Lenovo Thinkpad,2624,,,,,,,,"Lazy to troubleshoot, waiting for them to collect it back",1,9949

Lenovo Thinkpad,2624,,,,,,,,"I have to say, love the specs and the ability to upgrade almost everything",1,9951
Lenovo Thinkpad,2624,,,,,,,,is a gem.,1,9952
Lenovo Thinkpad,2624,,,,,,,,Plus the price..,1,9953
Lenovo Thinkpad,2625,,,,,,,,i guess AMD ryzen mobilechip has yet to be optimized by laptop manufacturers.,1,9954

Lenovo Thinkpad,2628,,,,,,,,Ryzen A485 is available on Malaysia¬¨√≠s website.,1,9962

Lenovo Thinkpad,2629,,,,,,,,"Nah, E480 and E485 share the same casing.",1,9964

Lenovo Thinkpad,2629,,,,,,,,T480s.,1,9969
Lenovo Thinkpad,2629,,,,,,,,That shows how much they've improved the E series too..,1,9970
Lenovo Thinkpad,2629,,,,,,,,"And you could probably
, or buy one straight from Lenovo, and just install it if you wanted.",1,9971
Lenovo Thinkpad,2629,,,,,,,,"The listings above aren't the cheapest you could get, a lot of sellers don't list the FRU P/Ns.",1,9972
Lenovo Thinkpad,2629,,,,,,,,"I think they should be of similar build, but they're not totally identical.",1,9973
Lenovo Thinkpad,2629,,,,,,,,Honestly I'm not sure why Lenovo doesn't just combine the A series into the T/X like they've done with the E.,1,9974
Lenovo Thinkpad,2630,,,,,,,A,"Nah, the backlight for the backlit keyboards doesn't work with the E485.",1,9975
Lenovo Thinkpad,2631,,,,,,,,Could be something to do with the firmware or the motherboard I guess.,1,9976
Lenovo Thinkpad,2631,,,,,,,,"But otherwise the construction is identical.
...",1,9977
Lenovo Thinkpad,2631,,N,,,,,,The funny thing is that Lenovo themselves list the backlit keyboards as being compatible with the E485.,1,9978
Lenovo Thinkpad,2632,,,,,,,,so are you returning it??,1,9979
Lenovo Thinkpad,2633,,,,,,,,"probably it's like kickstarter std, not ready for prime time babey",1,9980
Lenovo Thinkpad,2634,,,,,,,,Returned.,1,9981
Lenovo Thinkpad,2634,,,,,,,,They already processed it before the fix is out,1,9982

Lenovo Thinkpad,2665,,,,,,,,Thanks for the suggestion,1,10098
Lenovo Thinkpad,2665,,,,,,,,Looks like the cheapest Samsung 512GB NVME is $328,1,10099

Lenovo Thinkpad,2669,,,,,,,,on brief web surfing it maintains around 10k to 12k,1,10108
Lenovo Thinkpad,2669,,,,,,,,mah usage.,1,10109
Lenovo Thinkpad,2669,,,,,,,,For Intel it can go down to 7 to 9k or 4k when idle Ryzen idle is about 7-8k.,1,10110
Lenovo Thinkpad,2669,,,,,,,,Peak wise,1,10111
Lenovo Thinkpad,2669,,,,,,,,I think Ryzen is more efficient tho,1,10112
Lenovo Thinkpad,2670,,,,,,,,"If 4-5hr is an accurate estimate, then the average power consumption is like 9-11W for the 45WH/r battery.",1,10113

Lenovo Thinkpad,2689,,,,,,,,Both are slapped on and pressed down.,1,10169
Lenovo Thinkpad,2689,,,,,,,,The e475 used a phase change paste like shin etsu while the e485 use a wetter type like dow corning.,1,10170

Lenovo Thinkpad,2691,,,,,,,,Laptop sinks are normally low mounting pressure.,1,10175

Lenovo Thinkpad,3116,,,,,,,,One thing,1,11855
Lenovo Thinkpad,3116,,,,,,,,I'm unclear:,1,11856

Lenovo Thinkpad,3135,,,,,,,,Can I confirm that most users who order a HDD with their E585 and then immediately swap it out to their own SATA SSD is for the following reason:,1,11933
Lenovo Thinkpad,3135,,,,,,,,A,1,11934
Lenovo Thinkpad,3135,,,,,,,,they need a HDD for other usages and it is cheaper to get it as part of E585 bundle,1,11935

Lenovo Thinkpad,3135,,,,,,,,"for my config, I ordered a HDD = blank so that I can put a SATA SSD into the empty cavity.",1,11937
Lenovo Thinkpad,3136,,,,,,,,It depends on your setup.,1,11938
Lenovo Thinkpad,3136,,,,,,,,1,1,11939
Lenovo Thinkpad,3136,,,,,,,A,The bundle hdd is typically slightly cheaper than open market.,1,11940
Lenovo Thinkpad,3136,,,,,,,,But we are talking about just a few dollars difference.,1,11941
Lenovo Thinkpad,3136,,,,,,,,Data in hdd are easier to recover.,1,11942

Lenovo Thinkpad,3136,,,,,,,,I have a 500gb ssd from my old notebook to recycle.,1,11944

Lenovo Thinkpad,3323,,,,,,,,I believe there are some promo discount code that can give $250 for adults.,1,12580
Lenovo Thinkpad,3323,,,,,,,,The difference is only $50.,1,12581
Lenovo Thinkpad,3323,,,,,,,,I believe it is not just Lenovo that are giving discounts to students.,1,12582
Lenovo Thinkpad,3323,,,,,,,,I think Apple Store also have similar student type of discount.,1,12583

Lenovo Thinkpad,3329,,,,,,,,isnt MX500 limited to SATA speeds?,1,12609
Lenovo Thinkpad,3329,,,,,,,,yeah,1,12610
Lenovo Thinkpad,3329,,,,,,,,the Crucial P1 is QLC,1,12611
Lenovo Thinkpad,3329,,,,,,,,but they say its endurance of 100GB writes per day for 5 years,1,12612

Lenovo Thinkpad,3332,,,,,,,,I still have 3+gb ram free during TF2 so that's not the issue....,1,12622
Lenovo Thinkpad,3332,,,,,,,,hmmmmmm....,1,12623
Lenovo Thinkpad,3333,,,,,,,,Could it be ur 4 + 8gb ram?,1,12624
Lenovo Thinkpad,3333,,,,,,,,Heard the ryzen/vega performance r very dependent on dual channel memory capability.,1,12625
Lenovo Thinkpad,3334,,,,,,,,"yes i expected perhaps difference of couple fps, but shouldnt be so drastic...",1,12626
Lenovo Thinkpad,3335,,,,,,,,"Could be cuz different size and speed, dual channel may not work optimally.",1,12627
Lenovo Thinkpad,3335,,,,,,,,But depend on the chipset so best to use CPU-Z to see,1,12628
Lenovo Thinkpad,3335,,,,,,,,is it dual channel.,1,12629
Lenovo Thinkpad,3335,,,,,,,,If on budget than add another 4 to make it 4 + 4 so Dual channel.,2,12630
Lenovo Thinkpad,3335,,,,,,,,can work.,2,12630
Lenovo Thinkpad,3336,,,,,,,,Your RAM 8GB + 4GB are from the factory?,1,12631

Lenovo Thinkpad,3337,,,,,,,,yup checked they're in dual channel mode 2400mhz.,1,12635
Lenovo Thinkpad,3337,,,,,,,,"in any case, the difference to real world use is supposed to be very minute.",1,12636
Lenovo Thinkpad,3337,,,,,,,,I think it's due to something else....,1,12637

Lenovo Thinkpad,3338,,,,,,,,"The performance fluctuations are too huge, and while I expect QLC to be cheaper than TLC, it is not the case at this point.",1,12644
Lenovo Thinkpad,3339,,,,,,,,Monitor the temps and the clockspeed for both the CPU and GPU.,1,12645
Lenovo Thinkpad,3339,,,,,,,,"Anyway while the system is the same, it also depends on what applications are running in the background that will take up precious resources.",1,12646
Lenovo Thinkpad,3340,,,,,,,,"If it is only CPU, the impact may be limited, i.e. not all applications will benefit from a higher memory bandwidth.",1,12647
Lenovo Thinkpad,3340,,,,,,,,"However if you consider that the CPU and GPU are sharing the same memory, if its not running at dual channel, it will have a significant impact on performance when both are under load.",1,12648

Lenovo Thinkpad,3343,,,,,,,,I must've lowered settings earlier trying to fix that tiny lag....... and made it worse,1,12661
Lenovo Thinkpad,3344,,,,,,,,Don't look at the max values.,1,12662
Lenovo Thinkpad,3344,,,,,,,,You should check the real time clockspeed.,1,12663
Lenovo Thinkpad,3344,,,,,,,,"The APU cannot sustained at max clockspeed, especially in games when both the CPU and GPU are under load.",1,12664
Lenovo Thinkpad,3344,,,,,,,,The limitation is with the 15W TDP.,1,12665

Lenovo Thinkpad,3441,,,,,,,,Only played it for a short while on my son's desktop.,1,12997
Lenovo Thinkpad,3441,,,,,,,,Was planning to built a ryzen rig but decided to buy E585 instead.,1,12998
Lenovo Thinkpad,3441,,,,,,,,Now the money put into this notebook is no longer worth it.,1,12999
Lenovo Thinkpad,3441,,,,,,,,I thought I can play some games on the notebook.,1,13000
Lenovo Thinkpad,3441,,,,,,,,Just a causal gamer.,1,13001
Lenovo Thinkpad,3442,,,,,,,,Certain games,1,13002
Lenovo Thinkpad,3442,,,,,,,,iGPU won't be able to handle/support it,1,13003
Lenovo Thinkpad,3442,,,,,,,,"so need a
dedicated graphic card.",1,13004
Lenovo Thinkpad,3443,,,,,,,,"Can play, just not the gfx intensive ones..",1,13005
Lenovo Thinkpad,3444,,,,,,,,u should have done your research properly.,1,13006
Lenovo Thinkpad,3444,,,,,,,,"nevertheless, u can always sell it off to fund for your Ryzen Rig instead",1,13007
Lenovo Thinkpad,3445,,,,,,,,"It will run some games, but realistically, it is a 15W APU, so I won't expect it to run as well as what you read for the desktop variants with significantly more power to share for both the CPU and GPU.",1,13008
Lenovo Thinkpad,3445,,,,,,,,"So assuming that the memory is not an issue, I believe it will also be a stuttering mess for this game.",1,13009
Lenovo Thinkpad,3446,,,,,,,,"Thanks bro, my router is pretty near where I usually work.",1,13010
Lenovo Thinkpad,3446,,,,,,,,"Thanks, very helpful and useful video!",1,13011
Lenovo Thinkpad,3446,,,,,,,,Yep probably won¬¨√≠t replace us for now since my workspace is pretty much covered.,1,13012
Lenovo Thinkpad,3447,,,,,,,,Then it should not be a problem.,1,13013
Lenovo Thinkpad,3447,,,,,,,,"For me, I am quite close to the router when using it at home.",1,13014
Lenovo Thinkpad,3447,,,,,,,,"And if I do bring it out, it connects to my phone for WIFI, which will also be near.",1,13015
Lenovo Thinkpad,3448,,,,,,,,I read the starting of this thread in July 2018 have $200 discount.,1,13016
Lenovo Thinkpad,3448,,,,,,,,Now cny 2019 also have $200 discount.,1,13017

Lenovo Thinkpad,3450,,,,,,,,How do we go into BIOS?,1,13023
Lenovo Thinkpad,3450,,,,,,,,I tried F1 during startup and it does not work.,1,13024
Lenovo Thinkpad,3451,,,,,,,,"Yes, I noticed this happens on one night as well.",1,13025
Lenovo Thinkpad,3451,,,,,,,,"The usual code ""AMD18/",1,13026
Lenovo Thinkpad,3451,,,,,,,,"AMD19""",1,13027

Lenovo Thinkpad,3457,,,,,,,,"When I shut down, I always hold Shift before I hit the shut down button.",1,13044
Lenovo Thinkpad,3457,,,,,,,,I read somewhere,1,13045

Lenovo Thinkpad,3458,,,,,,,,"Good buy, but I would still opt for the cheapest SSD if I choose again.",1,13048
Lenovo Thinkpad,3458,,,,,,,,I feel the SSD upgrade is quite expensive.,1,13049
Lenovo Thinkpad,3458,,,,,,,,"For example, I can find a Crucial MX500 1TB SATA 3 SSD on Prime Now for 176 bucks after 10 bucks discount.",1,13050
Lenovo Thinkpad,3459,,,,,,,,Yup.,1,13051
Lenovo Thinkpad,3459,,,,,,,,I think the difference here is the pressing of the SHIFT key during shutdown.,1,13052
Lenovo Thinkpad,3459,,,,,,,,Else during bootup the interruption message followed by ENTER option will not appear on the screen.,1,13053
Lenovo Thinkpad,3460,,,,,,,,I agree too.,1,13054
Lenovo Thinkpad,3460,,,,,,,,I had actually initially selected the 128gb ssd.,1,13055
Lenovo Thinkpad,3460,,,,,,,,"But after the extra $50 discount appeared after 10pm, I decided to just go for the 256gb and not bother having to manually upgrading it.",1,13056

Lenovo Thinkpad,3461,,,,,,,,I believe you will add in another slot of ram?,1,13058
Lenovo Thinkpad,3461,,,,,,,,Optimal to run dual channel for this APU because of the shared memory for CPU and GPU.,1,13059
Lenovo Thinkpad,3462,,,,,,,,the SSD for 2280 confirm is NVME?,1,13060
Lenovo Thinkpad,3462,,,,,,,,not Sata right.,1,13061
Lenovo Thinkpad,3462,,,,,,,,any good deals?,1,13062
Lenovo Thinkpad,3463,,,,,,,,NVME SSD usually cost more than SATA.,1,13063
Lenovo Thinkpad,3463,P,,,,,,,NVME is faster but not noticeable.,1,13064
Lenovo Thinkpad,3464,,,,,,,,"yes, it is a NVME.",1,13065
Lenovo Thinkpad,3465,,,,,,,,"Yes, its NVME.",1,13066
Lenovo Thinkpad,3466,,,,,,,,"To add on, it cost significantly more.",1,13067
Lenovo Thinkpad,3466,,,,,,,,One usually pays a premium of at least 30% when between a SATA3 and a good NVME SSD.,1,13068
Lenovo Thinkpad,3467,,,,,,,,"hello guys, I just put in my SSD",1,13069
Lenovo Thinkpad,3467,,,,,,,,What program would you recommend to move the OS over from the default HDD to SSD?,1,13070
Lenovo Thinkpad,3468,,,,,,,,If I have a new SSD,1,13071
Lenovo Thinkpad,3468,,,,,,,,I generally prefer to re-install the OS rather than cloning the OS.,1,13072
Lenovo Thinkpad,3468,,,,,,,,Your windows keys are already embedded into the BIOS.,1,13073
Lenovo Thinkpad,3468,,,,,,,,After you have re-install the OS you can then find the key and activate Windows.,1,13074
Lenovo Thinkpad,3468,,,,,,,,The advantage is that you have a clean installation.,1,13075
Lenovo Thinkpad,3468,,,,,,,,The disadvantage is of course it is a tedious process and you need to copy the drivers over.,1,13076
Lenovo Thinkpad,3468,,,,,,,,I would try the clean install first just for knowledge learning.,1,13077
Lenovo Thinkpad,3468,,,,,,,,If it dun work then you clone it lor.,1,13078
Lenovo Thinkpad,3468,,,,,,,,I have already used the clean install method on two machine last year alone.,1,13079
Lenovo Thinkpad,3468,,,,,,,,I cannot recommend any cloning software as it has been a while that I clone OS liao.,1,13080
Lenovo Thinkpad,3469,,,,,,,,I saw a few 1TB priced down.,1,13081

Lenovo Thinkpad,3474,,,,,,,,"Anyway, I am still waiting for AMD to make good on their words to improve driver support on their mobile chips.",1,13091
Lenovo Thinkpad,3474,,,,,,,,They really need to be serious if they want to gain back market share in the mobile space.,1,13092
Lenovo Thinkpad,3475,,,,,,,,"Just my two cents, I think the new driver will come like this: - Release to manufacturer first.",2,13093

Lenovo Thinkpad,3475,,,,,,,,Since AMD Ryzen 3XXX series is around the corner.,1,13094
Lenovo Thinkpad,3475,,,,,,,,Laptop with the new chip will come with the newest driver.,1,13095
Lenovo Thinkpad,3475,,,,,,,,Probably once 3XXX series are officially out than the generic.,2,13096
Lenovo Thinkpad,3475,,,,,,,,driver mobile will follow.,2,13096
Lenovo Thinkpad,3475,,,,,,,,Probably june or so so for the meantime check the manufacturer website,1,13097
Lenovo Thinkpad,3475,,,,,,,,they will definitely get the driver first.,1,13098
Lenovo Thinkpad,3476,,,,,,,,Time consuming and not tedious,1,13099
Lenovo Thinkpad,3476,,,,,,,,u mean?,1,13100
Lenovo Thinkpad,3476,,,,,,,,Cos most of the time is just waiting for it to complete.,1,13101
Lenovo Thinkpad,3476,,,,,,,,And by right it will also auto install the required latest drivers?,1,13102
Lenovo Thinkpad,3476,,,,,,,,No need to copy over unless you want specific drivers to use.,1,13103
Lenovo Thinkpad,3477,,,,,,,,Auto install required latest drivers is more common for desktop installation.,1,13104
Lenovo Thinkpad,3477,,,,,,,,For notebook I observe that manufacturer tends to has more specific drivers that we need to either download from their website or that we must take it from one of the folders from the original drive.,1,13105
Lenovo Thinkpad,3477,,,,,,,,"Take the AMD drivers for example, we can't use the one from AMD.",1,13106
Lenovo Thinkpad,3477,,,,,,,,We must use the one from Lenovo.,1,13107
Lenovo Thinkpad,3477,,,,,,,,Maybe it is my lack of experience that I find it tedious AND time consuming.,1,13108
Lenovo Thinkpad,3477,,,,,,,,Still clean installation is a better way in my opinion.,1,13109
Lenovo Thinkpad,3478,,,,,,,,"Hi guys, if your screen is experiencing green or black flashes during video playback, I think that it has something to do with the driver's handling of Direct3D 11 hardware acceleration.",1,13110

Lenovo Thinkpad,3490,,,,,,,,Today I opened up my laptop and to install a hard drive and decided to apply some after market thermal compound to see if it will help bring down the heat.,1,13156
Lenovo Thinkpad,3490,,,,,,,A,"Taking the heatsink off is very easy, just loosen the 4 screws holding the heatsink to the processor, and a light pull and the entire heatsink and fan will pop out.",1,13157
Lenovo Thinkpad,3490,,,,,,,,Just be careful of the fan power cable because they look very thin and flimsy.,1,13158
Lenovo Thinkpad,3490,,,,,,,,"Anyway, I think I may not have installed the heatsink back",1,13159
Lenovo Thinkpad,3490,,,,,,,,well cause seems to be getting very hot.,1,13160
Lenovo Thinkpad,3490,,,,,,,,"Like at idle, its 60+ degs, and easily hit 80 degs.",1,13161
Lenovo Thinkpad,3490,,,,,,,,Haha.,1,13162
Lenovo Thinkpad,3490,,,,,,,,Not sure why the CPU seems to be working very hard.,1,13163
Lenovo Thinkpad,3490,,,,,,,,"Anyway, more work to do before I update again.",1,13164
Lenovo Thinkpad,3491,,,,,,,,"Anyway, I just wanted to check what is the idle and load temps that people are getting on this laptop with a Ryzen 5 please?",1,13165
Lenovo Thinkpad,3491,,,,,,,,"I wanted to do a comparison before and after, but now I don't remember how hot it used to run.",1,13166
Lenovo Thinkpad,3491,,,,,,,,"I've not reapply the thermal compound again, but I did noticed that the temps run high as a result of initial high CPU usage.",1,13167
Lenovo Thinkpad,3491,,,,,,,,"I did noticed that the clockspeed seems to hold above 2.2 Ghz in most cases, 200Mhz higher than the base clock, with short boost to over 3Ghz.",1,13168
Lenovo Thinkpad,3492,,,,,,,,What thermal paste did you apply?,1,13169
Lenovo Thinkpad,3493,,,,,,,,I used Thermal Grizzly Kyronaut.,1,13170
Lenovo Thinkpad,3493,,,,,,,,"Anyway, I opened the laptop up again to check.",1,13171
Lenovo Thinkpad,3493,,,,,,,,Tighten the screws more to improve the contact.,1,13172
Lenovo Thinkpad,3493,,,,,,,,"I can feel that the heatpipes heat up really quick throughout including the heatsink, so I think the  contact is good.",1,13173
Lenovo Thinkpad,3493,,,,,,,,Problem I believe is with the fan profile.,1,13174
Lenovo Thinkpad,3493,,,,,,,,"The fan only seems to kick in when the laptop hits about 62 to 65 degs, otherwise, it is not spinning at all.",1,13175
Lenovo Thinkpad,3493,,,,,,,A,"Also I noticed slight coil whine, which I initially thought was due to the fan.",1,13176
Lenovo Thinkpad,3493,,,,,,,A,But I observed the fan was not spinning and the slight humming sound is not coming from the fan.,1,13177
Lenovo Thinkpad,3494,,,,,,,,"If temp not improving, suggest try another thermal compound like Noctua.",1,13178
Lenovo Thinkpad,3494,,,,,,,,Can get from SLS.,1,13179
Lenovo Thinkpad,3494,,,,,,,,Tip to secure back the heat stink correctly.,1,13180
Lenovo Thinkpad,3494,,,,,,,,You have to secure the screws diagonally.,1,13181
Lenovo Thinkpad,3494,,,,,,,,This is to ensure proper pressure so the heat sink is secure to the CPU.,1,13182
Lenovo Thinkpad,3494,,,,,,,,Meaning top right to lower left and etc.,1,13183
Lenovo Thinkpad,3495,,,,,,,,"Yes, I did this.",1,13184
Lenovo Thinkpad,3495,,,,,,,,"Thermal compound wise, I believe the Thermal Grizzly is one of the best out there other than liquid metal.",1,13185
Lenovo Thinkpad,3495,,,,,,,,"It worked well with my graphic card, so I thought might as well use it on the laptop.",1,13186
Lenovo Thinkpad,3496,,,,,,,,A good estimate of improvement will be idle temperature.,1,13187
Lenovo Thinkpad,3497,,,,,,,,Many factors can cause wild fluctuations.,1,13188
Lenovo Thinkpad,3497,,,,,,,,Thermal profiles can be finicky.,1,13189
Lenovo Thinkpad,3497,,,,,,,,"On my Dell, if I wake it up on battery, it will sometimes throttle itself to a certain frequency e.g. 1.89 of 3.46GHz.",1,13190
Lenovo Thinkpad,3497,,,,,,,,"Plugging in and out the charger will cause it to ""remember"" that it can turbo and now it turbos all the way even on battery.",1,13191
Lenovo Thinkpad,3497,,,,,,,,Results in higher temps too.,1,13192
Lenovo Thinkpad,3498,,,,,,,A,I cannot really ascertain whether it's poor contact here.,1,13193
Lenovo Thinkpad,3498,,,,,,,,The temps can swing from 45 to 80 degs all of a sudden.,1,13194
Lenovo Thinkpad,3498,,,,,,,,"In this case, the entire heatpipe and heatsink is very hot.",1,13195
Lenovo Thinkpad,3498,,,,,,,,So I don't really think its a contact issue.,1,13196
Lenovo Thinkpad,3498,,,,,,,,But I will revalidate it by removing and reapplying a fresh new coat of thermal compound later this week.,1,13197
Lenovo Thinkpad,3499,,,,,,,,"Anyway before I start tearing it apart again, anyone can share their idle and load temps please?",1,13198
Lenovo Thinkpad,3499,,,,,,,,I tested mine in a non-airconditioned room.,1,13199
Lenovo Thinkpad,3499,,,,,,,,Temp as per probe is about 29 degs.,1,13200
Lenovo Thinkpad,3499,,,,,,,,"For mine, it idles at 45 minimal and loads to about 80 to 82 degs.",1,13201
Lenovo Thinkpad,3500,,,,,,,,"Actually, measuring idle temps might not be the best yardstick.",1,13202
Lenovo Thinkpad,3500,,,,,,,,Most modern laptops will put the fan into fully passive mode and fan spin can be triggered anywhere from high 40s to around 60c depending on the motherboard.,1,13203
Lenovo Thinkpad,3500,,,,,,,A,So you can get possibly higher idles on a better paste and lower idles on a poorer paste while the reverse is likely true under load,1,13204
Lenovo Thinkpad,3500,,,,,,,,So temperatures at the same load will be ideal.,1,13205
Lenovo Thinkpad,3500,,,,,,,,"At the same time, thermal grizzly's viscosity changes at 'out of tube' and steady state after thermal cycling.",1,13206
Lenovo Thinkpad,3500,,,,,,,,"It'll ""dry"" noticeably",1,13207
Lenovo Thinkpad,3500,,,,,,,,"and that's expected behaviour, overapply is a must.",1,13208
Lenovo Thinkpad,3500,,,,,,,,I do recall Roman Hartung der8auer who's basically thermal grizzly saying somewhere the paste longevity shortens at the high 70s.,1,13209
Lenovo Thinkpad,3500,,,,,,,,"In contrast for notebooks, I'd lean towards moderate or high viscosity pastes like NTH1/NTH2 and Gelid.",1,13210
Lenovo Thinkpad,3500,,,,,,,,High viscosity ones tend to work better with low mounting pressure i.e. laptops,1,13211
Lenovo Thinkpad,3501,,,,,,,,"Yeah, I did figure that it will be difficult to gauge since it is not going to be an apple to apple compare.",1,13212
Lenovo Thinkpad,3501,,,,,,,,"As for the overapplying, point noted.",1,13213

Lenovo Thinkpad,3553,,,,,,,,"Up and down stable at 250mbps+ starhub, also network connection speed all the way 886.7mbps.",1,13455
Lenovo Thinkpad,3553,,,,,,,,it's business plan.,1,13456
Lenovo Thinkpad,3554,,,,,,,,Hi bro.,1,13457
Lenovo Thinkpad,3554,,,,,,,,could it be possible that your office has a lower temp and the wifi card is not as hot?,1,13458
Lenovo Thinkpad,3555,,,,,,,,I tried using outside my office non aircon for a period of time and connected speed still 866.7mbps and speedtest still managed to get my office speed.,1,13459
Lenovo Thinkpad,3555,,,,,,,,Btw my office is a small single unit high roof with a 2nd floor.,1,13460
Lenovo Thinkpad,3555,,,,,,,,"2nd floor split into halfwooden partition , one for office, one for recreation and smoking corner.",1,13461
Lenovo Thinkpad,3555,,,,,,,,Router is generally place in the centre of 2nd floor.,1,13462
Lenovo Thinkpad,3555,,,,,,,,Edit: So likely my intel 9260ac don't like linksys EA8100.,1,13463
Lenovo Thinkpad,3555,,,,,,,,"Play with a lot of settings on the router liaoz, change channel la, put to ac only, set to 80mhz la.",1,13464

Lenovo Thinkpad,3555,,,,,,,,"At least the singtel oem won't have such issue, but heck it's okie",1,13466
Lenovo Thinkpad,3555,,,,,,,,just need to wait for my new powerline adapter and just connect to powerline ethernet.,1,13467
Lenovo Thinkpad,3555,,,,,,,,My current one i used it for fibre tv.,1,13468
Lenovo Thinkpad,3555,,,,,,,,P.S.,1,13469
Lenovo Thinkpad,3555,,,,,,,,I staying at my sister house and starhub,1,13470
Lenovo Thinkpad,3555,,,,,,,,i'm paying for it.,1,13471
Lenovo Thinkpad,3555,,,,,,,,So very hard for me to lay cable.,1,13472
Lenovo Thinkpad,3555,,,,,,,,Waiting my 2 room flat singles scheme to be built in 2 years time.,1,13473
Lenovo Thinkpad,3556,,,,,,,,I have the same problem.,1,13474

Lenovo Thinkpad,3556,,,,,,,,9260ac+ea8100.,3,13476
Lenovo Thinkpad,3556,,,,,,,,dlink 868: ~400mbps.,3,13476
Lenovo Thinkpad,3556,,,,,,,,linksys ea8100:,3,13476
Lenovo Thinkpad,3556,,,,,,,,~150mbps dload below 100mbps upload was worse at ~90mbps until starhub tech adjusted some settings,1,13477
Lenovo Thinkpad,3556,,,,,,,,but this was the best he could do,1,13478
Lenovo Thinkpad,3556,,,,,,,,Many others are complaining about the ea8100 too.,1,13479
Lenovo Thinkpad,3556,,,,,,,,"Btw, ea8100 is not 160mhz capable, it is multiple 80mhz capable.",1,13480
Lenovo Thinkpad,3556,,,,,,,,9260ac works with 160mhz capable routers for max performance,1,13481
Lenovo Thinkpad,3556,,,,,,,,but there are very few such routers and very expensive.,1,13482
Lenovo Thinkpad,3556,,,,,,,,I have an Acer with 9260,1,13483
Lenovo Thinkpad,3556,,,,,,,,"and it's getting ~400+mbps from ea8100, which is interesting.",1,13484
Lenovo Thinkpad,3557,,,,,,,,Thanks bro.,1,13485
Lenovo Thinkpad,3557,,,,,,,,So that confirms my guts feeling that the intel 9260ac hate the linksys ea8100.,1,13486
Lenovo Thinkpad,3557,,,,,,,,"Oh well i can live with it, no issue.",1,13487
Lenovo Thinkpad,3557,,,,,,,,Will be mainly connecting to powerline ethernet.,1,13488
Lenovo Thinkpad,3558,,,,,,,,"thing is, see my last sentence an old acer upgraded with 9260 works fine with ea8100...",1,13489
Lenovo Thinkpad,3558,,,,,,,,so may be the combo of e585,1,13490
Lenovo Thinkpad,3558,,,,,,,,+,1,13491
Lenovo Thinkpad,3558,,,,,,,,9260ac+ea8100 not working well together... hope someone else with this combo can also chip in to confirm.,1,13492
Lenovo Thinkpad,3559,,,,,,,,Probably e585 only compatible with certain WLAN card not to mentioned the driver.,1,13493
Lenovo Thinkpad,3560,,,,,,,,Oh my mistake lol.,1,13494
Lenovo Thinkpad,3560,,,,,,,,Missed out that sentence.,1,13495
Lenovo Thinkpad,3560,,,,,,,,"Well at the meantime, i can just use powerline ethernet at home, so not much of a biggie issue for now.",1,13496
Lenovo Thinkpad,3560,,,,,,,,Got time,1,13497
Lenovo Thinkpad,3560,,,,,,,,then i try find solution for it.,1,13498
Lenovo Thinkpad,3560,,,,,,,,Going to be busy soon.,1,13499

Lenovo Thinkpad,3571,,,,,,,,those 2 panels are already existing configuration options from Lenovo.,1,13524

Lenovo Thinkpad,3580,,,,,,,,If you are ordering E485 and only order M2 SSD without additional HDD you won't get the HDD mounting cage and connector.,1,13548
Lenovo Thinkpad,3580,,,,,,,,So you can't later add a SATA3 SSD.,1,13549
Lenovo Thinkpad,3580,,,,,,,,You have order the cage and connector thereafter as spare parts.,1,13550
Lenovo Thinkpad,3580,,,,,,,,Some others have indicated these parts can be bought online.,1,13551
Lenovo Thinkpad,3580,,,,,,,,For E585 the mounting cage comes along with the machine even when 2nd HDD is not ordered.,1,13552

Lenovo Thinkpad,3582,,,,,,,,"If only M2 SSD as second drive, can it still start or must I choose something for first drive?",1,13561
Lenovo Thinkpad,3583,,,,,,,,The group here did not get conclusive evidence on this maybe because no one has ordered both yet.,1,13562
Lenovo Thinkpad,3583,,,,,,,,I assumed OS would be on SSD using common sense,1,13563
Lenovo Thinkpad,3583,,,,,,,,but I now accept that common sense cannot be applied to this model since we found out cage is not included.,1,13564
Lenovo Thinkpad,3584,,,,,,,,Ryzen 3 should suffice,1,13565
Lenovo Thinkpad,3584,,,,,,,,but I generally tries to buy the highest CPU speed I can afford.,1,13566
Lenovo Thinkpad,3584,,,,,,,,Other parts can be upgraded easily.,1,13567
Lenovo Thinkpad,3584,,,,,,,,CPU is more challenging to upgrade.,1,13568
Lenovo Thinkpad,3584,,,,,,,,I bought ryzen 7.,1,13569
Lenovo Thinkpad,3584,,,,,,,,Edit,1,13570

Lenovo Thinkpad,3590,,,,,,,,"Also if you are not going to upgrade the ram on your own, it is recommended that you select 4GB x 2, instead of a single 8GB.",1,13585
Lenovo Thinkpad,3590,,,,,,,,"If you buy later in the night, I am not sure what time exactly, you can use SGNIGHT code that should give you 50 bucks more discount.",1,13586
Lenovo Thinkpad,3591,,,,,,,,Take note Ryzen 3 is dual core while Ryzen 5 is quad core.,1,13587
Lenovo Thinkpad,3592,,,,,,,,"Thanks guys for all the good info, didn't know got so many code, is the education code public?",1,13588

Lenovo Thinkpad,3640,,,,,,,A,"I don't have the answer either, but my gut feel is that the Ryzen 3 is definitely faster even though it is missing 2 physical core to compete.",1,13735
Lenovo Thinkpad,3640,,,,,,,,"Even though the Pentium Silver chips have 4 cores, they are typically limited to run at 10W, shared between the CPU and GPU.",1,13736

Lenovo Thinkpad,3640,,,,,,,,You can get a good indication by checking say an Intel i3 vs a Pentium Silver comparison.,1,13738
Lenovo Thinkpad,3641,,,,,,,A,Oh r u saying that a Ryzen 3 is as fast as an Intel i3?,1,13739
Lenovo Thinkpad,3642,P,,,,,,,Ryzen 3 2200U is more or less faster than i3.,1,13740

Lenovo Thinkpad,3649,,,,,,,,are are much better.,1,13764
Lenovo Thinkpad,3649,,,,,,,,A485 also have docking port if you intend to get a docking station.,1,13765
Lenovo Thinkpad,3649,,,,,,,,SSD,1,13766
Lenovo Thinkpad,3649,,,,,,,,wise recommended just get a m.2 SSD minimum 128GB for OS.,2,13767
Lenovo Thinkpad,3649,,,,,,,,will do.,2,13767
Lenovo Thinkpad,3649,,,,,,,,"No really recommended to get a big SSD for data storage, a HDD.",2,13768

Lenovo Thinkpad,3670,,,,,,,,Some have never heard of AMD especially those who are not into DIY.,1,13819
Lenovo Thinkpad,3670,N,,,,,,,But my two cents is that there is a bad perspective about AMD that it is hot and slow.,1,13820
Lenovo Thinkpad,3671,,,,,,,,"Yes, and this group of people who are more tech savvy.",1,13821
Lenovo Thinkpad,3671,,,,,,,,"But they feel to realized that the tide has turned and its now Intel that is running hot, especially the high end models.",1,13822
Lenovo Thinkpad,3671,,,,,,,,"At the lower end and low power models, they are still doing well.",1,13823
Lenovo Thinkpad,3671,,,,,,,,This goes to show how hard they have pushed their aging chips just to keep up with competition.,1,13824

Lenovo Thinkpad,3680,,,,,,,,the only difference I see is the hdd.,1,13852
Lenovo Thinkpad,3681,,,,,,,,It will handle most tasks easily.,1,13853
Lenovo Thinkpad,3681,,,,P,,,,"Weight aside at approx 2.1 KG which is not heavy to me, it is getting more and more stable since its launch last year.",1,13854
Lenovo Thinkpad,3681,,,,,,,,I've been using the E485 which is essentially the same,1,13855
Lenovo Thinkpad,3681,,,,,,,,"but with a smaller monitor, and its been very stable for me.",1,13856
Lenovo Thinkpad,3681,,,,,,,,"Compared to an Intel laptop of similar class/ build, this probably loses out in terms of battery life.",1,13857

Lenovo Thinkpad,3688,,,,,,,,"I can only see on A485 which states Gen3 x2, aka 16Gbs/s.",1,13895

Lenovo Thinkpad,3690,,,,,,,,"Yup, just wanted to make sure not buying any higher speed nvme that will be bottled neck by the pcie speed.",1,13897
Lenovo Thinkpad,3691,,,,,,,,For A485 is 16GB/S according to Lenovo.,1,13898
Lenovo Thinkpad,3692,,,,,,,,There is no reason to limit what SSD to get just because it can't run at full speed.,1,13899

Lenovo Thinkpad,3693,,,,,,,,USD vs Samsung Evo Plus 1TB $250 USD.,1,13906

Lenovo Thinkpad,3705,,,,,,,,"Powerbank for such laptop, normal powerbank are not usable.",1,13943
Lenovo Thinkpad,3705,,,,,,,,You need this type of charger.,1,13944
Lenovo Thinkpad,3705,,,,,,,,It's pricey,1,13945
Lenovo Thinkpad,3705,,,,,,,,but if you get cheap and not compatible powerbank.,1,13946
Lenovo Thinkpad,3705,,,,,,,,You may risk damaging the laptop.,1,13947
Lenovo Thinkpad,3706,,,,,,,,"I can't find any review of Ryzen 3000 mobile notebooks to date, though someone has recently compared gaming performance between Ryzen 2500U & the 3500U on YouTube.",1,13948

Lenovo Thinkpad,3706,,,,,,,,Hopefully the high idle power consumption of the Ryzen 2000 mobile has been alleviated partially with the 12nm node.,1,13952
Lenovo Thinkpad,3706,,,,,,,,I say partially cos it will probably take more than a half node shrink to fix high idle power consumption.,1,13953
Lenovo Thinkpad,3706,,,,,,,,Intel just have much more experience in minimizing CPU idle power consumption over the years.,1,13954

Lenovo Thinkpad,3708,,,,,,,,What's your recommendation?,1,13962
Lenovo Thinkpad,3708,,,,,,,,Are there any big difference between the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7?,1,13963
Lenovo Thinkpad,3709,,,,,,,,2700U only have 200 more mhz in Base & Boost clocks respectively.,1,13964
Lenovo Thinkpad,3709,P,,,,,,,It also has faster integrated graphics.,1,13965
Lenovo Thinkpad,3709,,,,,,,,"Besides these 2 factors, they share the exact feature set.",1,13966
Lenovo Thinkpad,3709,,,,,,,,2700U vs 2500u makes a small difference in games Say 10-15%.,1,13967
Lenovo Thinkpad,3709,,,,,,,,"In non-gaming usage CPU intensive, the difference is single digit.",1,13968
Lenovo Thinkpad,3709,,,,,,,,Just make sure that the 8GB is 2 sticks dual channel.,1,13969
Lenovo Thinkpad,3709,,,,,,,,"Imho, 12-16GB dual channel is better as 8gb is really the bare minimum nowadays.",1,13970
Lenovo Thinkpad,3709,,,,,,,,And having memory in Dual channel makes a big difference for Ryzens.,1,13971
Lenovo Thinkpad,3710,P,,,,,,,"On paper, Ryzen 7 is faster, i.e. CPU with higher clockspeed and more beefy GPU.",1,13972
Lenovo Thinkpad,3710,,,,,,,,"In reality when both CPU and GPU are under load, both Ryzen 5 and 7 will throttle due to insufficient power and in most cases, a lack of cooling as well.",1,13973
Lenovo Thinkpad,3710,,,,,,,,These ultra low power CPU are rated at 15W and is able to boost temporarily to 25W.,1,13974
Lenovo Thinkpad,3710,,,,,,,,That's not a lot of power to share between the CPU and GPU.,1,13975
Lenovo Thinkpad,3710,,,,,,,,The situation is the same for Intel's ultra low power chips.,1,13976
Lenovo Thinkpad,3711,,,,,,,,Good to go.,1,13977
Lenovo Thinkpad,3711,,,,,,,,Between 5 and 7 is the clockspeed.,1,13978
Lenovo Thinkpad,3711,,,,,,,,Remember to buy additional ram for the laptop to take advantage of the dual channel which benefit the Ryzen APU.,1,13979
Lenovo Thinkpad,3712,,,,,,,,In what cases will both CPU and GPU be under load?,1,13980

Lenovo Thinkpad,3714,,,,,,,,Not sure if Lenovo will be changing other hardware components on the E495/E595.,1,13986
Lenovo Thinkpad,3714,,,,,,,,The new ideaPad with Ryzen 3xxx are already out for online order.,1,13987
Lenovo Thinkpad,3714,,,,,,,,"However, no customization is allowed & the default configuration is lacking on those.",1,13988

Lenovo Thinkpad,3717,,,,,,,,True but pricing maybe different.,1,13996
Lenovo Thinkpad,3717,,,,,,,,Older model will be cheap while newer can be more expensive.,1,13997
Lenovo Thinkpad,3718,,,,,,,,Actually not insufficient power but the TDP limitation.,1,13998
Lenovo Thinkpad,3718,,,,,,,,Since AMD Ryzen 2500U is ultra low wattage with TDP set at,1,13999
Lenovo Thinkpad,3718,,,,,,,,15 watt minimum while the max is 25 watt.,1,14000
Lenovo Thinkpad,3718,,,,,,,,"Under load like games, 3D application and etc.",1,14001
Lenovo Thinkpad,3718,,,,,,,,than the turbo.,2,14002
Lenovo Thinkpad,3718,,,,,,,,will kick in than the APU TDP will rise to 25 watt.,2,14002
Lenovo Thinkpad,3718,,,,,,,,Not sure in the BIOS whether the AMD SenseMI can be disable.,2,14003
Lenovo Thinkpad,3718,,,,,,,,or not.,2,14003
Lenovo Thinkpad,3718,,,,,,,,Intel is Intel Speedstep while AMD is SenseMI,1,14004
Lenovo Thinkpad,3718,,,,,,,,"However even if it is possible, it will impact performance.",1,14005

Lenovo Thinkpad,3720,,,,,,,,"Gaming, which is also one of the main reasons to choose a APU over a CPU.",1,14008
Lenovo Thinkpad,3720,,,,,,,,"Depends on the manufacturer, some allow you to turn the TDP up for Intel, not sure for AMD.",1,14009

Lenovo Thinkpad,3721,,,,,,,,The 3xxx series is not going to be a game changer in terms of performance as compared to the current 2xxx series.,1,14011
Lenovo Thinkpad,3722,,,,,,,,"Most manufacturers will not allow you to tamper with the TDP, especially on a laptop.",1,14012
Lenovo Thinkpad,3722,,,,,,,,The reason is because the cooling solution for a laptop is made for the TDP that they set.,1,14013
Lenovo Thinkpad,3722,,,,,,,,By allowing for a permanent TDP increase by user means it may overheat.,1,14014
Lenovo Thinkpad,3722,,,,,,,,"There may be ways to do it, but definitely not something that is covered under warranty.",1,14015
Lenovo Thinkpad,3722,,,,,,,,"So far, I've only seen those smaller China manufacturers such as Chuwi, Oanda, Cube, etc, allowing users to increase the TDP.",1,14016
Lenovo Thinkpad,3723,,,,,,,,That is true.,1,14017
Lenovo Thinkpad,3724,,,,,,,,Thx all for the helpful advice.,1,14018
Lenovo Thinkpad,3724,,,,,,,,Is the 12GB 4+8 DDR4 2400MHz,1,14019
Lenovo Thinkpad,3724,,,,,,,,SoDIMM consider a 2 sticks ram dual channel?,1,14020

Lenovo Thinkpad,3728,,,,,,,,Thks for all the replies guys.,1,14031
Lenovo Thinkpad,3728,,,,,,,,Glad to have got confirmation about the usb pd powerbank notion.,1,14032
Lenovo Thinkpad,3728,,,,,,,,For battery life we can use a scaling factor just to estimate.,1,14033
Lenovo Thinkpad,3728,,,,,,,,"If recall correctly, lenovo specs a 9hr battery life, user reviews puts it approx 4.5 hrs..",1,14034
Lenovo Thinkpad,3728,,,,,,,,So a 50% factor may be a good starting estimate.,1,14035
Lenovo Thinkpad,3728,,,,,,,,The new spec for the e495 puts it at 13hrs...,1,14036
Lenovo Thinkpad,3728,,,,,,,,so hopefully this translates to at least 6.5hours..,1,14037

Lenovo Thinkpad,3765,,,,,,,,The E495 WiFi is 2x2 MiMO compared to E485 1x1,1,14142
Lenovo Thinkpad,3765,,,,,,,,so WiFi connectivity should be better on E495,1,14143
Lenovo Thinkpad,3766,,,,,,,,Strange that the Ex95,1,14144

Lenovo Thinkpad,3782,,,,,,,,Is E585 or E595 a better purchase and what are the difference in price and specs?,1,14188
Lenovo Thinkpad,3783,,,,,,,,At this point in time.. if you are getting.,1,14189
Lenovo Thinkpad,3783,,,,,,,,get the newer version.,1,14190
Lenovo Thinkpad,3783,,,,,,,,imo la.,1,14191
Lenovo Thinkpad,3784,,,,,,,,"E585 AMD Ryzen 7 2700U Processor 6MB Cache, up to 3.80GHz",1,14192
Lenovo Thinkpad,3784,,,,,,,,"E595 AMD Ryzen 5 3500U Processor 4MB Cache, up to 3.60GHz",1,14193
Lenovo Thinkpad,3784,,,,,,,,Which processor is better?,1,14194
Lenovo Thinkpad,3784,P,,,,,,,It seems E585 has faster and larger cache CPU.,1,14195
Lenovo Thinkpad,3785,,,,,,,,"In case anyone getting the newer ones, use ANNIVERSARY15 as the coupon code, u'll get 15% as compared to other codes which is ~10% off only.",1,14196
Lenovo Thinkpad,3786,,,,,,,,You can choose ryzen 7 for e595 also.,1,14197
Lenovo Thinkpad,3787,,,,,,,,"Depend on your budget, if you want to save than older model E585.",1,14198
Lenovo Thinkpad,3787,,,,,,,,E595 at this time it is pricey than E585 but the APU is newer.,2,14199
Lenovo Thinkpad,3787,,,,,,,,as well as WLAN is using Intel AC than previous Qualcomm.,2,14199
Lenovo Thinkpad,3788,,,,,,,,They have exactly the same amount of cache 2MB L2 & 4MB L3.,1,14200
Lenovo Thinkpad,3788,,,,,,,,Lenovo just use different ways of calculating it.,1,14201
Lenovo Thinkpad,3788,,,,,,,,2700U or 3700U cpu is not worth it,1,14202
Lenovo Thinkpad,3788,,,,,,,,IMHO due to the steep price increase over 2500U or 3500U.,1,14203
Lenovo Thinkpad,3788,,,,,,,,"Likewise, the price difference is small between both models, just go for the newer model.",1,14204
Lenovo Thinkpad,3789,,,,,,,,"Regardless of AMD or Intel, there is very little reason to pay more for the higher end",1,14205
Lenovo Thinkpad,3789,,,,,,,,"Ryzen 7 or Core i7 ultra low voltage processors, i.e 15W TDP.",1,14206
Lenovo Thinkpad,3789,,,,,,,,"Most reviews have shown that if both the CPU and GPU are taxed simultaneously, they generally perform no better than their lower end",1,14207
Lenovo Thinkpad,3789,,,,,,,,"Ryzen 5 or Core i5 counterparts because 1TDP is capped, and 2Cooling solution is generally customized for the TDP.",1,14208
Lenovo Thinkpad,3789,,,,,,,,"There are rare cases where I've seen the higher end CPU making a difference, and in almost every case, its because they are running a discrete graphic card and better cooling.",1,14209
Lenovo Thinkpad,3790,,,,,,,A,"I've not been checking the price, but if the price difference is not that great, then go for the newer version.",1,14210
Lenovo Thinkpad,3791,,,,,,,,This is questionable.,1,14211
Lenovo Thinkpad,3791,,,,,,,,12nm is nothing but a tweaked + more matured 14nm.,1,14212
Lenovo Thinkpad,3791,,,,,,,,"So while it will certainly become more efficient, I suspect the increase in clockspeed over the older chips will nullify the potential improvement to battery life.",1,14213
Lenovo Thinkpad,3792,,,,,,,,"If we ignore the Boost clockspeeds, base clockspeed increase is minimum, just 100mhz for both 3500U & 3700U.",1,14214
Lenovo Thinkpad,3792,,,,,,,,So I suspect that they focused on maintaining or lowering the power consumption instead.,1,14215
Lenovo Thinkpad,3792,,,,,,,,Also the high idle power consumption may be improved in this iteration via other means such as further platform optimization & hardware bug fixes.,1,14216
Lenovo Thinkpad,3792,,,,,,,,"As of now, AMD's 2018 Raven Ridge @14nm is not even on par with Intel 2014 Haswell @22nm in terms of idle power consumption.",1,14217
Lenovo Thinkpad,3792,,,,,,,,AMD has a lot of catching up to do in this aspect of mobile computing.,1,14218
Lenovo Thinkpad,3792,,,,,,,,It's something which Intel has a lot more experience in.,1,14219
Lenovo Thinkpad,3793,,,,,,,,"Even though I agree, take note that Intel NB chips",1,14220
Lenovo Thinkpad,3793,,,,,,,A,the onboard graphic.,2,14221
Lenovo Thinkpad,3793,N,,,,,,,isn't that as fast/powerful as compare with AMD Vega.,2,14221
Lenovo Thinkpad,3793,,,,,,,,If power were to go down than the onboard Vega performance will also be hamper.,1,14222
Lenovo Thinkpad,3793,,,,,,,,These chips are not just CPU,1,14223
Lenovo Thinkpad,3793,,,,,,,,but they also have IGP with it on the same die.,1,14224

Lenovo Thinkpad,3794,,,,,,,,Pricing will be above $1k depending on specs.,1,14226
Lenovo Thinkpad,3794,,,,,,,,AMD Ryzen APU Thinkpad the advantage would be one chip.,2,14227

Lenovo Thinkpad,3794,,,,,,,,Unlike Intel based laptop if you need better graphic than.,2,14228
Lenovo Thinkpad,3794,,,,,,,,have to opt for optional Nvidia graphics which cost more.,2,14228
Lenovo Thinkpad,3794,,,,,,,,Downside I think most will agree is that AMD Ryzen APU,1,14229
Lenovo Thinkpad,3794,,,,,,,,battery time isn't that as good with Intel.,1,14230
Lenovo Thinkpad,3794,P,,,,,,,Since Ryzen APU packs a powerful CPU and GPU on one die.,1,14231

Lenovo Thinkpad,3835,,,,,,,,How is this comparable with E495?,1,14371
Lenovo Thinkpad,3835,,,,P,P,,,"It has backlit keyboard not that it matters, longer battery stamina, lighter by at least 250grams to my friend",1,14372
Lenovo Thinkpad,3835,,,,,,,,it matters alot and my last e485,1,14373
Lenovo Thinkpad,3835,,,,,,,,"the weight on lenovo is not accurate it is heavier than what was advertised, thin bezel..",1,14374
Lenovo Thinkpad,3835,,,,,,,,mx150,1,14375
Lenovo Thinkpad,3836,,P,,,,,,Depend on your preference but Thinkpad build and keyboard is better.,1,14376
Lenovo Thinkpad,3836,,,,,,,,Since you owned the e485 than if you feel swift is better than that.,2,14377
Lenovo Thinkpad,3836,,,,,,,,just get it.,2,14377
Lenovo Thinkpad,3837,,,,,,,,Dis you get additional 15% from 961?,1,14378
Lenovo Thinkpad,3837,,,,,,,,Or 961 is after discount?,1,14379
Lenovo Thinkpad,3837,,,,,,,,Sent from HUAWEI ELE-L29 using GAGT,1,14380
Lenovo Thinkpad,3838,,,,,,,,This looks very tempting!,1,14381
Lenovo Thinkpad,3838,,,,,,,,"New to thinkpad here, can't seem to find many reviews on this",1,14382
Lenovo Thinkpad,3838,,,,,,,,e495,1,14383
Lenovo Thinkpad,3838,,,,,,,,though..,1,14384
Lenovo Thinkpad,3838,,,,,,,,Is it a new model?,1,14385
Lenovo Thinkpad,3839,,,,,,,,New model reviews usually won't be out so soon maybe within 6 months.,1,14386
Lenovo Thinkpad,3840,,,,,,,,Does the E485/ E495 support the regular 45W charger?,1,14387
Lenovo Thinkpad,3840,,,,,,,,I was thinking of getting the Xiaomi 45 W changer and the Powerbank with USB PD 45W.,1,14388
Lenovo Thinkpad,3841,,,,,,,,"It works with the Xiaomi 45W Type C charger, but not sure about the powerbank.",1,14389
Lenovo Thinkpad,3842,,,,,,,,Just bought a set.,1,14390
Lenovo Thinkpad,3842,,,,,,,,Any lobang to get a 1tb sata 3 ssd?,1,14391
Lenovo Thinkpad,3843,,,,,,,,You can either check on Lazada for say a 1TB Transcend SSD or check on Amazon Prime Now.,1,14392
Lenovo Thinkpad,3843,,,,,,,,"You should be able to get 1TB for around 150 bucks after discount on Lazada, or on Prime Now.",1,14393
Lenovo Thinkpad,3844,,P,,,,,,I agree keyboard is better on the ThinkPad.,1,14394
Lenovo Thinkpad,3844,,,,,,,,"Build wise, it really depends since the E series is really the budget series, while the Swift 3 is not really that budget based on their price.",1,14395
Lenovo Thinkpad,3844,,,,,,,,My sister is using Swift 3,1,14396
Lenovo Thinkpad,3844,,,,,,,,and I think the build is better.,1,14397
Lenovo Thinkpad,3844,,,,,,,,Only downside about the Swift 3 I believe is the fact that you don't get much upgrade option since the memory is soldered.,1,14398
Lenovo Thinkpad,3844,,,,,,,,"In this case, the ThinkPad E series is more versatile since we can add more RAM and have a secondary drive.",1,14399
Lenovo Thinkpad,3845,,,,,,,,I don't think there is anything significantly different between this and the older E485.,1,14400
Lenovo Thinkpad,3845,,,,,,,,Look up for reviews for E485,1,14401
Lenovo Thinkpad,3845,,,,,,,,and you should get a reasonably close review of the E495.,1,14402
Lenovo Thinkpad,3845,P,,,,,,,"You should see slight improvements with performance, and better WIFI performance depends if Lenovo uses Intel wireless card.",1,14403
Lenovo Thinkpad,3846,,,,,,,,Thinkpad has many series.,1,14404
Lenovo Thinkpad,3846,,,,,,,,Seems L series A series and E series around $1k.,1,14405
Lenovo Thinkpad,3846,,,,,,,,Which series more value for money?,1,14406
Lenovo Thinkpad,3847,,,,,,,,"E series, E495/E595 are the best value for now.",1,14407
Lenovo Thinkpad,3847,,,,,,,,A series will be under T series very soon so that series pricing may drop.,1,14408
Lenovo Thinkpad,3848,,,,,,,,"Not to mention improved battery life, due to the 12nm CPU.",1,14409
Lenovo Thinkpad,3849,,,,,,,,I feel we may not see much of an improvement in this area.,1,14410
Lenovo Thinkpad,3849,,,,,,,,"12nm is actually a refined 14nm, which is basically the same as Intel's branding of 14nm+.",1,14411
Lenovo Thinkpad,3849,,,,,,,,So the improvement is not going to be significant.,1,14412
Lenovo Thinkpad,3849,,,,,,,,"If AMD maintained the clockspeed, we may see an improvement in efficiency, but since they bumped up both the CPU and GPU speed, it will nullify any improvements to battery life.",1,14413
Lenovo Thinkpad,3850,,,,,,,,Thanks Watzup_ken and Techidiot for the advise.,1,14414
Lenovo Thinkpad,3850,,,,,,,,Will check out the e485 before I make a decision!,1,14415
Lenovo Thinkpad,3851,,,,,,,,That is good to know.,1,14416
Lenovo Thinkpad,3851,,,,,,,,I thinking of getting a compactUSB Type Charger so that I can travel without having too many chargers if I getting this laptop,1,14417
Lenovo Thinkpad,3852,,,,,,,,I'm considering between E495 and Vivobook S14.,1,14418
Lenovo Thinkpad,3852,,,,,,,,"For those using the E485, are your laptop lasting?",1,14419
Lenovo Thinkpad,3853,,,,,,,,Thinkpad - Business,1,14420
Lenovo Thinkpad,3853,,,,,,,,Vivobook - Consumer,1,14421
Lenovo Thinkpad,3853,,,,,,,,"The choice is definetely Thinkpad, since it is meant for business",1,14422
Lenovo Thinkpad,3853,,,,,,,,so.,2,14423
Lenovo Thinkpad,3853,,,,,,,,durability would be better than consumer grade laptop.,2,14423
Lenovo Thinkpad,3853,,,,,,,,"I have stop supporting Asus, their service center is a let down.",1,14424
Lenovo Thinkpad,3853,,,,,,,,"Don't forget Thinkpad you can opt for onsite warranty,",1,14425
Lenovo Thinkpad,3853,,,,,,,,"anything
can call so need to bring down for servicing like Asus laptop.",1,14426
Lenovo Thinkpad,3854,,,,,,,,Considering E495 and C340 AMD.,1,14427
Lenovo Thinkpad,3854,,,,,,,,C340 is paying premium for the ability to convert and touchscreen?,1,14428
Lenovo Thinkpad,3855,,,,,,,,We will need to wait for more reviews to confirm.,1,14429
Lenovo Thinkpad,3855,,,,,,,,"But in the full review of a 35W Picasso 12nm laptop with discrete graphics link below, the idle power consumption is much lower than all Raven Ridge 14nm laptops.",1,14430
Lenovo Thinkpad,3855,,,,,,,,"Apparently, there was some issue with higher idle power consumption which is fixed in the Picasso 12nm CPUs.",1,14431
Lenovo Thinkpad,3855,,,,,,,,Also AMD only raise the clockspeeds a little 5%- <10%.,1,14432
Lenovo Thinkpad,3856,,,,,,,,"AMD Ryzen 5 3500U Processor 4MB Cache, up to 3.60GHz",1,14433
Lenovo Thinkpad,3856,,,,,,,,"AMD Ryzen 7 3700U Processor 4MB Cache, up to 3.80GHz",1,14434
Lenovo Thinkpad,3856,,,,,,,,Price difference is $130.,1,14435
Lenovo Thinkpad,3856,,,,,,,,Most of the buyers here choose Ryzen 5 or 7?,1,14436
Lenovo Thinkpad,3857,,,,,,,,Ryen 5 will do fine for normal usage.,1,14437
Lenovo Thinkpad,3857,,,,,,,,Unless you intend to game than get the Ryzen 7.,1,14438
Lenovo Thinkpad,3858,,,,,,,,But integrated graphics right?,1,14439
Lenovo Thinkpad,3858,,,,,,,,Noob question,1,14440
Lenovo Thinkpad,3858,,,,,,,,", I don't game but mostly use it fir work where I open multiple chrome tabs 30-40 and YouTube.",1,14441
Lenovo Thinkpad,3858,,,,,,,,Does integrated graphics work good enough or,1,14442
Lenovo Thinkpad,3858,,,,,,,,can it be changed myself otherwise?,1,14443
Lenovo Thinkpad,3859,,,,,,,,"If you need to open 30 to 40 tabs of chrome, I think RAM must have at least 8GB.",1,14444
Lenovo Thinkpad,3859,,,,,,,,My house laptop has dedicated graphic card.,1,14445
Lenovo Thinkpad,3859,,,,,,,,My office laptop using integrated graphic card.,1,14446

Lenovo Thinkpad,3860,,,,,,,,HD,2,14448
Lenovo Thinkpad,3860,,,,,,,,so graphic power wise,1,14449
Lenovo Thinkpad,3860,,,,,,,,it is decent enough without need.,2,14450

Lenovo Thinkpad,3862,,,,,,,,It is a good deal after 15% discount and 9% shopback.,1,14453
Lenovo Thinkpad,3862,,,,,,,,It also come with 3 years on site warranty.,1,14454
Lenovo Thinkpad,3862,,,,,,,,But the delivery is in Oct'19.,1,14455

Which laptop to choose based on your hands on experience?",1,14463
Lenovo Thinkpad,3865,,,,,,,,1,1,14464
Lenovo Thinkpad,3865,,,,,,,,E495,1,14465
Lenovo Thinkpad,3865,,,,,,,,2 E595.,2,14466
Lenovo Thinkpad,3865,,,,,,,,3 A485,2,14466
Lenovo Thinkpad,3866,,,,,,,,E series definitely.,1,14467
Lenovo Thinkpad,3866,,,,,,,,The A series will be refresh soon so best skip.,1,14468
Lenovo Thinkpad,3866,,,,,,,,"Between 4 or 5, take note of the size.",1,14469
Lenovo Thinkpad,3866,,,,,,,,595 is bigger and heavier than 495.,1,14470
Lenovo Thinkpad,3866,,,,,,,,If you want portability than 495 will do fine.,1,14471
Lenovo Thinkpad,3867,,,,,,,,E series more plastic?,1,14472
Lenovo Thinkpad,3867,,,,,,,,A series is aluminium?,1,14473
Lenovo Thinkpad,3868,,,,,,,,E series E485/495 is mostly metal case for the display frame.,1,14474
Lenovo Thinkpad,3868,,N,,,,,,The other half Keyboard/palmrest area is all plastic.,1,14475
Lenovo Thinkpad,3868,,,,,,,,No idea about A series.,1,14476
Lenovo Thinkpad,3868,,,,,,,,"A485 seems to have weaker cooling than the E series, though this may have been alleviated in newer BIOS versions.",1,14477
Lenovo Thinkpad,3869,,,,,,,,"hey guys,
E495 battery life is around 3h ??????????",1,14478
Lenovo Thinkpad,3869,,,,,,,,freaking cui...,1,14479
Lenovo Thinkpad,3869,,,,,,,,i really suggest you guys buy something else if you need a long battery life,1,14480
Lenovo Thinkpad,3870,,,,,,,,You got your E495 already?,1,14481
Lenovo Thinkpad,3870,,,,,,,,I have a E595,1,14482
Lenovo Thinkpad,3870,,,,,,,,", it's about the same if not worse.",1,14483
Lenovo Thinkpad,3870,,,,,,,,"Besides battery life, it's still a pretty good laptop.",1,14484
Lenovo Thinkpad,3870,,,,,,,,Try switching from the Ryzen optimised power plan to Windows Balanced power plan.,1,14485
Lenovo Thinkpad,3870,,,,,,,,Apparently the Ryzen optimised power plan is obsolete in Windows 10 build 1809.,1,14486
Lenovo Thinkpad,3871,,,,P,,,,"The A series which I know is really focused on portability, i.e. small and light.",1,14487
Lenovo Thinkpad,3871,,,,,,,,Therefore the cooling solution is weaker.,1,14488
Lenovo Thinkpad,3871,,,,,,,,"For example, you are likely to see 1 heatpipe vs 2 heatpipes when comparing A and E series laptops.",1,14489
Lenovo Thinkpad,3872,,,,,,,,yes it is that chui.,1,14490
Lenovo Thinkpad,3872,,,,,,,,hence i got myself the acer swift instead.,1,14491
Lenovo Thinkpad,3873,,,,,,,,"While I agree if battery life is a priority then better to look elsewhere, we do have to account for the fact that it is a ThinkPad at sub 1k price tag.",1,14492
Lenovo Thinkpad,3873,,,,,,,,Typically budget series laptop comes with budget battery capacity as well.,1,14493
Lenovo Thinkpad,3874,,,,,,,,Worth to get T495 over E495?,1,14494
Lenovo Thinkpad,3875,,,,,,,,under 1k i don't really expect the rest of the other brands to last significantly longer.,1,14495
Lenovo Thinkpad,3876,,,,,,,,there are - depends on what you want.,1,14496
Lenovo Thinkpad,3877,,,,,,,,"If battery life is important, get the regular Intel based E490 lor.",1,14497
Lenovo Thinkpad,3878,,,,,,,,Really depends especially budget as T495 will cost twice depending.,2,14498
Lenovo Thinkpad,3878,,,,,,,,on the configuration.,2,14498
Lenovo Thinkpad,3878,,,,,,,,Advantage over E are: - Option for better panel. - WWAN included.,3,14499
Lenovo Thinkpad,3878,,,,,,,,- Onboard 8GB ram. -,3,14499
Lenovo Thinkpad,3878,,,,,,,,Better chassis and build than E. - Docking port.,3,14499
Lenovo Thinkpad,3878,,,,,,,,T495 with Ryzen 7 with best configuration will cost near $2k.,1,14500
Lenovo Thinkpad,3878,,,,,,,,Like others mention if battery is a concern than get Intel based.,1,14501
Lenovo Thinkpad,3879,,,,,,,,How is your usage?,1,14502
Lenovo Thinkpad,3879,,,,,,,,Gaming?,1,14503
Lenovo Thinkpad,3879,,,,,,,,"According to Lenovo spec, it can last for 13 hours for video playback.",1,14504
Lenovo Thinkpad,3880,,,,,,,,what do you recommend?,1,14505
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,That depends what is more important that u need.,1,14506
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,"If battery life is a concern, go get the Swift 3.",1,14507
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,The Swift 3 with HD Graphics and i5 - cost u less than $900 over at Qoo10.,1,14508
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,P,"It is 1.45KG, with backlit keyboard, longer battery stamina and nice metallic thin 3 sided bezel, modern looking case",1,14509
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,+,1,14510
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,the Fn key is in the inside not the outside,1,14511
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,If u top up alittle more to get the 1 with MX150/250 @ 1298-1398 before discount - if u play your card rights - it should be below 1k or close to 1k.,1,14512
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,Currently Qoo10 has 15% off with AMEX for QCoins.,1,14513
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,Acer - Qoo10 also have $30,1,14514
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,U can wait for the next 100 off 1000 or 40/50 off 300 etc,1,14515
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,coupons to bring it further south.,1,14516
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,"However, if onsite warranty is a concern because you buy a laptop and expect it to break multiple times - go for Lenovo with 10 years ago battery life but ""better"" durability and almost 500g heavier in weight.",1,14517
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,"Also, the Vega10 is pretty decent compared to the pathetic Intel HD.",1,14518
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,"Maybe to some, 500grams is nothing - note that i have to carry alot of other stuffs and not just the laptop.",1,14519
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,any potential weight savings is a huge welcome.,1,14520
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,Note:,1,14521
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,I am comparing with Ryzen 7 vs i5-8265,1,14522
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,the 8265 is on par with Ryzen 7 - scores based on,1,14523
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,"In other words, i feel the Acer Swift 3 is more value for money than Lenovo.",1,14524
Lenovo Thinkpad,3881,,,,,,,,Lenovo used to be more attractive however the recent surge in pricing doesn't do justice to it any longer.,1,14525
Lenovo Thinkpad,3882,,,,,,,,"Basically:
- Longer battery =",1,14526
Lenovo Thinkpad,3882,,,,,,,,"Intel based laptop
- Better Graphics",1,14527
Lenovo Thinkpad,3882,,,,,,,,,1,14528
Lenovo Thinkpad,3882,,,,,,,,Intel HD is crappy as compare with Vega graphics.,1,14529
Lenovo Thinkpad,3882,,,,,,,,Probably also Intel HD graphic consume less power than Vega.,1,14530
Lenovo Thinkpad,3882,,,,,,,,Overall battery time on Intel would be better.,1,14531
Lenovo Thinkpad,3883,,,,,,,,You comparison link is to a i7?,1,14532
Lenovo Thinkpad,3883,,,,,,,,do you have the link?,1,14533
Lenovo Thinkpad,3883,,,,,,,,cause i can't find the swift 3 with similar specs to the one a guy bought recently,1,14534

Lenovo Thinkpad,3884,,,,,,,,Ryzen 7 vs i5.,1,14536

Lenovo Thinkpad,3951,,,,,,,,How does S540 compare to E495?,1,14923
Lenovo Thinkpad,3951,,,,,,,,i am using an Ideapad 710s for past few many years.,1,14924
Lenovo Thinkpad,3951,,N,,,,,,"Overall it works well for me, no issues with the hinge, but admit that touch pad is poor.",1,14925
Lenovo Thinkpad,3951,N,,,,,,,"Changing because it is rather low spec i3, 4gb ram and getting slow for my needs mainly chrome with 15-20 tabs, word processing, netflix, no games.",1,14926
Lenovo Thinkpad,3952,,,,,,,,The normal HDD is optional.,1,14927
Lenovo Thinkpad,3952,,,,,,,,You can always add a 2.5 inch SSD or HDD later since the drive cabby is included by default.,1,14928
Lenovo Thinkpad,3952,,,,,,,,"It's mostly for folks who need:
1",1,14929
Lenovo Thinkpad,3952,,,,,,,,Extra storage.,2,14930
Lenovo Thinkpad,3952,,,,,,,,2 Dual Boot,2,14930
Lenovo Thinkpad,3952,,,,,,,,"Thinkpad E series despite being budget Thinkpads, will still have better build quality than most Ideapads.",1,14931
Lenovo Thinkpad,3952,,,,,,,,"Since it's not mentioned specifically, the WIFI card on the S540 is most likely from Realtek or Qualcomm.",1,14932
Lenovo Thinkpad,3952,,,,,,,,So the E495 have a small advantage here due to,1,14933
Lenovo Thinkpad,3952,,,,,,,,it's Intel Wifi card.,1,14934
Lenovo Thinkpad,3952,,,,,,,,"Lastly, Business line laptops tend to be better supported than consumer lines.",1,14935
Lenovo Thinkpad,3952,,,,,,,,Meaning more frequent & regular BIOS/driver updates.,1,14936
Lenovo Thinkpad,3953,,,,,,,,The wifi card that was shown when I configured my ideapad L340 gaming was the same as the S540,1,14937
Lenovo Thinkpad,3953,,,,,,,,and I expected something not from Intel.,1,14938
Lenovo Thinkpad,3953,,,,,,,,Ended up to be the Intel AC 9560 when I received it.,1,14939
Lenovo Thinkpad,3954,,,,,,,,I would advice not to consider Ideapad the build quality is not as good as Thinkpad.,1,14940
Lenovo Thinkpad,3954,,,,,,,,"Most will opt for SSD + HDD, SSD for OS.",1,14941
Lenovo Thinkpad,3954,,,,,,,,"HDD for data, data backup and games.",1,14942
Lenovo Thinkpad,3954,,,,,,,,"Especially if SSD fails, at least HDD act as backup.",1,14943
Lenovo Thinkpad,3955,,,,,,,,"If current HDD used less than 400GB, then drop the HDD and get SSD512G.",1,14944
Lenovo Thinkpad,3955,,,,,,,,"If over 400, get the HDD.",1,14945
Lenovo Thinkpad,3955,,,,,,,,"Netflix, HWZ, no games: Ryzen 3 + SSD + 8GB RAM is enough.",1,14946
Lenovo Thinkpad,3955,,,,,,,,More core = more expensive= more electric = more heat = more fan noise all for nothing when they are not used.,1,14947
Lenovo Thinkpad,3955,,,,,,,,Your cheapest upgrade could be buy a SSD to replace the HDD + 4GBRAM for current system.,1,14948
Lenovo Thinkpad,3956,,,,,,,,shall wait for promo first,1,14949
Lenovo Thinkpad,3957,,,,,,,,I switched from e485 to IdeaPad 720s and disagree that the build quality on the E series Thinkpads are better.,1,14950
Lenovo Thinkpad,3957,,,,,,,,I think IdeaPad higher end series quality wise is better than entry level Thinkpad.,1,14951
Lenovo Thinkpad,3957,,,,,,,,"For one, the screen assembly on the e485 is too thin such that just touching the back of the screen will cause the LCD to warp.",1,14952
Lenovo Thinkpad,3957,,,,,,,,But between e495 and,1,14953
Lenovo Thinkpad,3957,,,,,,,,s540,1,14954
Lenovo Thinkpad,3957,,,,,,,,"I will choose e495, if only for the ability to charge the laptop through USB-C which can come in pretty handy.",1,14955
Lenovo Thinkpad,3958,,,,,,,,"If the OS in SSD, once fails, it fails?",1,14956
Lenovo Thinkpad,3958,,,,,,,,The best way is to setup RAID1 for SSD+HDD?,1,14957
Lenovo Thinkpad,3959,,,,,,,,I've used a high end,1,14958
Lenovo Thinkpad,3959,,,,,,,,Lenovo laptop previously,1,14959
Lenovo Thinkpad,3959,,,,,,,,and yes it is definitely better.,1,14960
Lenovo Thinkpad,3959,,,,,,,,However we need to factor in their price range.,1,14961
Lenovo Thinkpad,3959,,,,,,,,"Lenovo 7xx series is considered high to mid high end, while the ThinkPad E series is really the budget end.",1,14962
Lenovo Thinkpad,3959,,,,,,,,So it is not a good comparison.,1,14963
Lenovo Thinkpad,3959,,,,,,,,It will be more appropriate to compare a Lenovo 3xx series with the ThinkPad E series.,1,14964
Lenovo Thinkpad,3959,,,,,,,,"And in this case, I believe the ThinkPad build will be better since it is after all targeting corporate clients.",1,14965
Lenovo Thinkpad,3960,,,,,,,,"Honestly if OS is on the SSD, I don't see the point of doing a RAID 1 on it.",1,14966
Lenovo Thinkpad,3960,,,,,,,,It fails it fails.,1,14967
Lenovo Thinkpad,3960,,,,,,,,You can always reinstall the OS back on a replaced/new SSD.,1,14968
Lenovo Thinkpad,3960,,,,,,,,"If you are worried about reinstalling all the apps on the SSD, just do a backup image of the drive and store it somewhere.",1,14969
Lenovo Thinkpad,3960,,,,,,,,"If required, you just need to clone the image to the new drive.",1,14970
Lenovo Thinkpad,3960,,,,,,,,I don't see the need to complicate solution using things like RAID where it is will just exhaust the already limited storage space in a laptop.,1,14971
Lenovo Thinkpad,3961,,,,,,,,"No need, what I meant as SSD have write cycle limit.",1,14972
Lenovo Thinkpad,3961,,,,,,,,If it fails and you have to wait for RMA.,1,14973
Lenovo Thinkpad,3961,,,,,,,,At least you can install OS onto the HDD as well as store,1,14974
Lenovo Thinkpad,3961,,,,,,,,all important data on the HDD than SDD.,1,14975
Lenovo Thinkpad,3962,,,,,,,,"After viewing for days between E495, E595, X395 & T495.",3,14976
Lenovo Thinkpad,3962,,,,,,,,Decide to take up E595 that fits my tight budget.,3,14976
Lenovo Thinkpad,3962,,,,,,,,Delivery date estimated at 4 - 5 July,3,14976
Lenovo Thinkpad,3963,,,,,,,,"In the 1st place, RAID 1 can only be done between storage media of the same.",2,14977
Lenovo Thinkpad,3963,,,,,,,,size & type.,2,14977
Lenovo Thinkpad,3963,,,,,,,,You can't do a RAID 1 between SSD & HDD.,1,14978
Lenovo Thinkpad,3964,,,,,,,,"if SSD exceeds the TBW and fails, i don't think it is eligible for RMA.",1,14979
Lenovo Thinkpad,3964,,,,,,,,Even SSD vendor exclude TBW exceeds from RMA.,1,14980
Lenovo Thinkpad,3965,,,,,,,,"Thanks for sharing, just citing why there are options for SSD and HDD.",1,14981

Lenovo Thinkpad,3968,,,,,,,,Mine seems to be estimated 3 weeks++,1,14991
Lenovo Thinkpad,3969,,,,,,,,It took less than 2 weeks.,1,14992

Lenovo Thinkpad,4069,,,,,,,,"hi guys,
Not sure this is a valid question - If I opt for additional SSD , Lenovo will install the OS on SSD right?",1,15249
Lenovo Thinkpad,4069,,,,,,,,The last thing I want is for them to install windows on the HDD duh when I added on SSD,1,15250
Lenovo Thinkpad,4070,,,,,,,,Actually I see no point in having a 4K screen on a laptop.,1,15251
Lenovo Thinkpad,4070,,,,,,,,"First the screen is too small, so you will need to scale the fonts to about 250%, and in some cases that it does not scale, you will struggle to see.",1,15252

Lenovo Thinkpad,4094,,,,,,,,sounds like i shouldn't worried.,1,15385
Lenovo Thinkpad,4095,,,,,,,,It depends on your usage and expectation actually.,1,15386
Lenovo Thinkpad,4095,,,,,,,,"2 things I feel will be a problem if you are a hardcore photoshop user,
1",1,15387
Lenovo Thinkpad,4095,,,N,,,,,Screen is not that great - You will need a better external monitor.,1,15388
Lenovo Thinkpad,4095,P,,,,,,,2 CPU is that very powerful due to 15W TDP -,1,15389
Lenovo Thinkpad,4095,N,,,,,,,So you can't expect it to process as fast as say a 35/45/65W CPU.,1,15390
Lenovo Thinkpad,4096,,,,,,,,16 GB should be able to run Photoshop well enough.,1,15391
Lenovo Thinkpad,4096,,,,,,,,"You should use the money to buy a bigger SSD, CPU and best screen as Photoshop is more disk and CPU intensive.",1,15392
Lenovo Thinkpad,4097,,,,,,,,"E595 is using low wattage CPU at 15W, so even if it can run.",1,15393
Lenovo Thinkpad,4097,N,,,,,,,It won't run that as fast like desktop or laptop with H series CPU/APU.,1,15394

Lenovo Thinkpad,4114,,,,,,,,the processor is just ryzen 3,1,15459
Lenovo Thinkpad,4115,,,,,,,,14 inch via 13.3 inch,1,15460
Lenovo Thinkpad,4115,,,,,,,,What do you decide this between both?,1,15461
Lenovo Thinkpad,4115,,,,,,,,Weight : 1.25kg vs 1.75kg,1,15462
Lenovo Thinkpad,4115,,,,,,,,X395 Ryzen Pro vs E495 non Pro CPU.,1,15463
Lenovo Thinkpad,4115,,,,,,,,X395 ram onboard while E495 ram can upgrade.,1,15464
Lenovo Thinkpad,4115,,,,,,,,E495,1,15465
Lenovo Thinkpad,4115,,N,,,,,,no fingerprint and backlight keyboard.,1,15466
Lenovo Thinkpad,4115,,,,,,,,The rest all same,1,15467
Lenovo Thinkpad,4116,,,,,,,,"As what obichacha have quoted, X and E series are different.",1,15468
Lenovo Thinkpad,4116,,,,,,,,"The APU/CPU is also different, X395 uses Ryzen 3 pro.",1,15469
Lenovo Thinkpad,4116,,,,P,,,,X series is intended for ultralight weight and portability,1,15470
Lenovo Thinkpad,4116,,,,P,,,,so it is much lighter than E.,1,15471
Lenovo Thinkpad,4116,,,,,,,,Take,1,15472
Lenovo Thinkpad,4116,,,,,,,,note X395 ram isn't upgradable and it only have SSD option.,2,15473
Lenovo Thinkpad,4116,,,,,,,,as compare with e495,2,15473
Lenovo Thinkpad,4116,,,,,,,,where you can opt for SSD and HDD.,1,15474
Lenovo Thinkpad,4116,,,,,,,,Basic use,1,15475
Lenovo Thinkpad,4116,,,,,,,,e495 will do fine.,1,15476
Lenovo Thinkpad,4117,,,,,,,,"Thanks, I will try on that.",1,15477
Lenovo Thinkpad,4117,,,,,,,,"So far as long the laptop not fully charged at 100%, it will not on.",1,15478
Lenovo Thinkpad,4117,,,,,,,,I played with the Lenovo Vantage to stop charging at 95%.,1,15479
Lenovo Thinkpad,4117,,,,,,,,So far no issue,1,15480
Lenovo Thinkpad,4118,,,,,,,,Power cord at 65W,1,15481
Lenovo Thinkpad,4118,,,,,,,A,mean it charge faster then 45W?,1,15482
Lenovo Thinkpad,4119,,,,,P,,,X2 faster than the 45W,1,15483
Lenovo Thinkpad,4120,,,,,,,,Lol,1,15484
Lenovo Thinkpad,4120,,,,,,,,Ô£ø√º√≤√á,1,15485
Lenovo Thinkpad,4120,,,,,,,,hopefully will ship out in time,1,15486
Lenovo Thinkpad,4121,,,,,,,,"Just received my E595, can't help but notice an electrical buzzing sound.",1,15487
Lenovo Thinkpad,4121,,,,,,,,It's not loud,1,15488
Lenovo Thinkpad,4121,,,,,,,,but it's audible in a quiet room.,1,15489
Lenovo Thinkpad,4121,,,,,,,,You guys think this is normal?,1,15490
Lenovo Thinkpad,4122,,,,,,,,"oh no, i feel like getting E595 also, sounds like HDD issue or fan issue.",1,15491
Lenovo Thinkpad,4122,,,,,,,,"otherwise, how is the performance so far?",1,15492
Lenovo Thinkpad,4123,,,,,,,,No complaints about performance.,1,15493
Lenovo Thinkpad,4123,,,,,,,,Will monitor the buzzing sound,1,15494
Lenovo Thinkpad,4124,,,,,,,,I own an E595 and help my fren buy a budget HP Ryzen 3 laptop.,1,15495
Lenovo Thinkpad,4124,,,,,,,,So far veey satisfy with the performance for the money paid.,1,15496
Lenovo Thinkpad,4125,,,,,,,,Actually the performance of Ryzen already proven..,1,15497
Lenovo Thinkpad,4125,,,,,,,,i tested multiple setup with Ryzen 3 & i think compare to Intel entry setup this really flies...,1,15498
Lenovo Thinkpad,4125,,,,,,,,only concern is on the reliability.. need to see how it is proven.,1,15499
Lenovo Thinkpad,4125,,,,,,,,AMD used to gave us reliability issue around 2-3 years... with processing speed improving & SSD,1,15500
Lenovo Thinkpad,4125,,,,,,,,these lappy nowadays can last 3- 5 years... & still very good,1,15501
Lenovo Thinkpad,4126,,,,,,,A,"Nowadays the recent laptops can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even last more than 4 years, cause due to software upgrade much faster than our hardware.",1,15502
Lenovo Thinkpad,4126,,,,,,,,Unless you keep this for general use purposes.,1,15503
Lenovo Thinkpad,4126,,,,,,,,"For AMD technology can last you more than 3 years, this is consider Super worthy for money.",1,15504
Lenovo Thinkpad,4127,,,,,,,,Lenovo kept postponing ... twice .. saying parts issue ... cancelled my order ...,1,15505
Lenovo Thinkpad,4127,,,,,,,,hope you have better luck.,1,15506
Lenovo Thinkpad,4128,,,,,,,,How you cancel your order?,1,15507
Lenovo Thinkpad,4128,,,,,,,,"My E490 also got delayed, tried using their live chat",1,15508
Lenovo Thinkpad,4128,,,,,,,,but it doesn't even load the thing when I press it,1,15509
Lenovo Thinkpad,4128,,,,,,,,", do I have to call them?",1,15510
Lenovo Thinkpad,4128,,,,,,,,Wonder if I can still cancel since I already received my bag and mouse first.,1,15511
Lenovo Thinkpad,4129,,,,,,,,G5 where got so cheap,1,15512
Lenovo Thinkpad,4129,,,,,,,,Maybe G3 la,1,15513
Lenovo Thinkpad,4129,,,,,,,,Hahaha,1,15514
Lenovo Thinkpad,4129,,,,,,,,coz,1,15515
Lenovo Thinkpad,4129,,,,,,,,I wan buy also,1,15516
Lenovo Thinkpad,4130,,,,,,,,Mainlycoz of this window 10?,1,15517
Lenovo Thinkpad,4130,,,,,,,,Then shitty to me,1,15518
Lenovo Thinkpad,4131,,,,,,,,What games r u playing???,1,15519
Lenovo Thinkpad,4132,,,,,,,,Then go live chat and ask for more discount.,1,15520
Lenovo Thinkpad,4132,,,,,,,,Usual,1,15521
Lenovo Thinkpad,4132,,,,,,,,they do for all customers,1,15522
Lenovo Thinkpad,4133,,,,,,,,I got my refund thru livechat at the lenovo website.,1,15523
Lenovo Thinkpad,4133,,,,,,,,the customer rep emailed their logistics side to expedite but even he didnt get a reply from this own logistics!,1,15524
Lenovo Thinkpad,4133,,,,,,,,he helped me close the account.,1,15525
Lenovo Thinkpad,4133,,,,,,,,i saved myself the nightmare of delays and further delays and went to SLS and bought a Dell on the spot.,1,15526
Lenovo Thinkpad,4134,,,,,,,,Buzzing sound may be a coil whine.,1,15527
Lenovo Thinkpad,4134,,,,,,,,At least I don't notice it on the older E485.,1,15528
Lenovo Thinkpad,4135,,,,,,,,I don't know how you can quantify AMD reliability at around 2 to 3 years.,1,15529
Lenovo Thinkpad,4135,,,,,,,,"Do note that say if you buy a laptop, while the laptop is powered by an AMD chip, the parts selected in a laptop is the responsibility of the manufacturers.",1,15530
Lenovo Thinkpad,4135,,,,,,,N,"So if you want cheap, then do expect some corners to be cut, i.e. poorer quality components used.",1,15531
Lenovo Thinkpad,4135,,,,,,,,"Moreover, there is no guarantee that even top end components will not fail.",1,15532
Lenovo Thinkpad,4135,,,,,,,,"I've used multiple laptops, and I am sure Intel powered laptops have a clean sheet in terms of failure rate.",1,15533
Lenovo Thinkpad,4135,,,,,,,,But I don't ding them as it is the laptop manufacturers' problem most of the time.,1,15534
Lenovo Thinkpad,4136,,,,,,,,Yeah bought the same accessories as you.,1,15535
Lenovo Thinkpad,4136,,,,,,,,Waiting for them to deliver to me on 13 August 2019,1,15536
Lenovo Thinkpad,4137,,,,,,,,AMD laptop still cheaper in markets.,1,15537
Lenovo Thinkpad,4137,,,,,,,,"Talk about reliable wise, just use to it,",1,15538
Lenovo Thinkpad,4137,,,,,,,,cause they are newer in market now.,1,15539
Lenovo Thinkpad,4137,,,,,,,,How they proven has not issue,1,15540
Lenovo Thinkpad,4137,,,,,,,,", anyway just trust on ThinkPad with add up your warranty.",1,15541
Lenovo Thinkpad,4137,,,,,,,,I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t think that Intel CPU doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t needs warranty so far.,1,15542
Lenovo Thinkpad,4137,,,,,,,,"For me that is the options, either AMD or Intel.",1,15543
Lenovo Thinkpad,4137,,,,,,,,IF you have more budget go for Intel will do.,1,15544
Lenovo Thinkpad,4137,,,,,,,,I will look forward about AMD performance Ô£ø√º√≤√á,1,15545
Lenovo Thinkpad,4138,P,,,,,,,Lol your ordered is faster than me.,1,15546
Lenovo Thinkpad,4139,,,,,,,,Another reason going for Ryzen for me is to prevent intel monopoly.,1,15547
Lenovo Thinkpad,4139,,,,,,,,Lol Ô£ø√º√≤√â,1,15548
Lenovo Thinkpad,4140,,,,,,,,"Intel is fine, just the CPU runing hot when charging while runing a software.",1,15549
Lenovo Thinkpad,4140,,,,,,,,Mine was i7-8550U,1,15550
Lenovo Thinkpad,4140,,,,,,,,the exhaust fan runing high speed all the time.,1,15551
Lenovo Thinkpad,4141,,,,,,,,just wanted to share some notes on the E495.,1,15552
Lenovo Thinkpad,4141,,,,,,,A,"was deciding between either the E495 or E595, as the price difference was very slight.",1,15553
Lenovo Thinkpad,4141,,,,P,,,,"In the end, choose the 14"" as it is lighter.",1,15554
Lenovo Thinkpad,4141,,,,,,,,ordered on 23/7 and finally got it on 2/8 late at night.,1,15555
Lenovo Thinkpad,4141,,,,,,,,impressed with the UPS delivery as they delivered at 9,1,15556

Lenovo Thinkpad,4141,,,,N,,N,,"Cons, heavy compared to my previous 13"", but the X395 was a little pricey and not as value for $ as this.",1,15570
Lenovo Thinkpad,4141,,N,,,,,,"no backlit keyboard option on the E495, if they had this, it would have been perfect.",1,15571
Lenovo Thinkpad,4141,,,,,,,,I hope this helps folks out there deciding if they should consider buying this.,1,15572

Lenovo Thinkpad,5472,,,,,,,,If that¬¨√≠s the case the,1,20006

Lenovo Thinkpad,5478,,,,,,,,I rather you install a 2TB SATA SSD than to spend a fortune getting an SD card.,1,20023

Lenovo Thinkpad,5560,,,,,,,,There aren¬¨√≠t many pre-installed software in the default.,1,20298
Lenovo Thinkpad,5560,,,,,,,,The notable one is the Vantage.,1,20299
Lenovo Thinkpad,5560,,,,,,,,I reformat and and reinstall the OS and the drivers from Lenovo when I received my T495.,1,20300
Lenovo Thinkpad,5560,,,,,,,,"Before that, you have to create the bootable thumb drive.",1,20301
Lenovo Thinkpad,5560,,,,,,,,Instructions are found on Lenovo site.,1,20302
Lenovo Thinkpad,5560,,,,,,,,The microSD reader and SIM reader are different.,1,20303
Lenovo Thinkpad,5560,,,,,,,,The SIM reader is only functional if you have selected this option during the order and the modem will be installed in the machine.,1,20304
Lenovo Thinkpad,5560,,,,,,,,"Otherwise, it will just be a SIM card slot.",1,20305
Lenovo Thinkpad,5560,,,,,,,,Not sure if the same goes to your X395.,1,20306
Lenovo Thinkpad,5561,,,,,,,,"No problem, my suggested steps: - Prepare the OS installation USB.",3,20307
Lenovo Thinkpad,5561,,,,,,,,- Prepare and download the drivers from Lenovo. -,3,20307
Lenovo Thinkpad,5561,,,,,,,,"During OS install, do not connect to internet.",3,20307
Lenovo Thinkpad,5561,,,,,,,,This is to prevent OS from installing the driver on,1,20308
Lenovo Thinkpad,5561,,,,,,,,it's own.,1,20309
Lenovo Thinkpad,5561,,,,,,,,,1,20310
Lenovo Thinkpad,5561,,,,,,,,,1,20311
Lenovo Thinkpad,5561,,,,,,,,can load after everything is done.,1,20312
Lenovo Thinkpad,5562,,,,,,,,yeah..,1,20313
Lenovo Thinkpad,5562,,,,,,,,I will definitely reinstall vantage after I reformat.,1,20314

Lenovo Thinkpad,5562,,,,,,,,sim card slot?,2,20318
Lenovo Thinkpad,5562,,,,,,,,I didn't have that option.,1,20319
Lenovo Thinkpad,5562,,,,,,,,only WWAN which I did not select.,1,20320
Lenovo Thinkpad,5562,,,,,,,,I saw some posts here that they have internet access with simcard.,1,20321
Lenovo Thinkpad,5562,,,,,,,,hence im confused,1,20322
Lenovo Thinkpad,5562,,,,,,,,haha,1,20323
Lenovo Thinkpad,5562,,,,,,,,Yup... that is my plan.,1,20324
Lenovo Thinkpad,5562,,,,,,,,I know drivers can be found on the support page of your laptop.,1,20325
Lenovo Thinkpad,5562,,,,,,,,Just enter serial number.,1,20326
Lenovo Thinkpad,5563,,,,,,,,What abt using Windows 10 recovery function where u can format windows 10,1,20327
Lenovo Thinkpad,5563,,,,,,,,so without reinstalling the entire OS?,1,20328
Lenovo Thinkpad,5564,,,,,,,,"That one is different, is basically wipe any data as well as program and driver to original state.",1,20329
Lenovo Thinkpad,5564,,,,,,,,Useful if you want to sell the PC without leaving any data behind as well as any issue reset will be useful.,1,20330
Lenovo Thinkpad,5564,,,,,,,,Reinstall typically is for better performance for new PC since most use factory image which comes with bloatware.,1,20331
Lenovo Thinkpad,5564,,,,,,,,As well as when there is new Windows build than typically reinstall the OS will be recommended.,1,20332
Lenovo Thinkpad,5565,,,,,,,,Now is ver 1909 not 1903.,1,20333
Lenovo Thinkpad,5566,,,,,,,,I know.. use windows update to get 1909 lol..,1,20334
Lenovo Thinkpad,5567,,,,,,,,Recommend you to build a new Windows USB Installer with build 1909.,1,20335
Lenovo Thinkpad,5567,,,,,,,,"Save time from updating to 1909 as well as when Windows update,",1,20336
Lenovo Thinkpad,5567,,,,,,,,it will update from 1909/concurrent period.,1,20337
Lenovo Thinkpad,5567,,,,,,,,1903 and,1,20338
Lenovo Thinkpad,5567,,,,,,,,previous build might take longer to update along with it's.,2,20339
Lenovo Thinkpad,5567,,,,,,,,own patches at the time.,2,20339
Lenovo Thinkpad,5568,,,,,,,,idk if the microsoft site's 1909 is clean..,1,20340
Lenovo Thinkpad,5568,,,,,,,,"the 1903 is what my office uses hence its ""certified clean""",1,20341
Lenovo Thinkpad,5569,,,,,,,,No problems.,1,20342
Lenovo Thinkpad,5569,,,,,,,,I did a clean install after swapping out the SSD on my E485.,1,20343
Lenovo Thinkpad,5569,,,,,,,,Works fine.,1,20344
Lenovo Thinkpad,5570,,,,,,,,Microsoft direct ISO builder are as clean as it can get.,1,20345

Lenovo Thinkpad,5571,,,,,,,,"Hi not sure if this is off topic.. would like to know from people here, in terms of durability/ ""steady laptop"", can help to differentiate the thinkpad t495 vs the hp elitebook 745 g6?",1,20347
Lenovo Thinkpad,5572,,,,,,,,Thinkpad will be better.,1,20348
Lenovo Thinkpad,5572,,,,,,,,"HP Elitebook cost more, quality wise",1,20349

Lenovo Thinkpad,5573,,,,,,,,"if u ask this here, then they will say lenovo is better.",1,20352
Lenovo Thinkpad,5573,,,,,,,,"anyway, lenovo ThinkPad are notoriously known for its durability.",1,20353
Lenovo Thinkpad,5574,,,,,,,,Saw x395 review damn good.... ticked on all the checkboxes ....can even use for gaming,1,20354
Lenovo Thinkpad,5575,,,,,,,,I didn't actually see an amd elitebook thread,1,20355
Lenovo Thinkpad,5575,,,,,,,,so i threw the question here,1,20356
Lenovo Thinkpad,5575,,,,,,,,.. was hoping on a more balanced feedback.. apparently the elitebook doesn't have any review for it.,1,20357
Lenovo Thinkpad,5575,,,,,,,,Hence have to ask.,1,20358
Lenovo Thinkpad,5575,,,,,,,,I am biased towards lenovo too..,1,20359
Lenovo Thinkpad,5575,,,,,,,,but the t495 build seems similar to 745 G6 and has two sodimms compared to t495's 1 sodimm.,1,20360
Lenovo Thinkpad,5576,,,,,,,,My laptop has been shipped.,1,20361
Lenovo Thinkpad,5576,,,,,,,,Expected arrival end of this week.,1,20362
Lenovo Thinkpad,5577,,,,,,,,Is the shipping time accurate?,1,20363
Lenovo Thinkpad,5577,,,,,,,,shows that its shipping out on 11 May!!!,1,20364
Lenovo Thinkpad,5577,,,,,,,,and expected to arrive on 15 May...,1,20365
Lenovo Thinkpad,5577,,,,,,,,VR has alr been shipped tho,1,20366
Lenovo Thinkpad,5577,,,,,,,,so...,1,20367
Lenovo Thinkpad,5577,,,,,,,,I guess I can play VR during the lockdown $1 for the VR if you're asking,1,20368
Lenovo Thinkpad,5578,,,,,,,,Any comments to get the base e595 with dummy hdd and upgrade ram and ssd?,1,20369
Lenovo Thinkpad,5578,,,,,,,,Will it cause warranty issues later on?,1,20370
Lenovo Thinkpad,5579,,,,,,,N,"Objectively, I avoid HP laptops for retail consumers due to the poor experiences.",1,20371
Lenovo Thinkpad,5579,,,,,,,,However the Elitebook targeted for corporate users seems to be significantly better in terms of reliability and quality.,1,20372
Lenovo Thinkpad,5579,,,,,,,,I was using one in my company that last well over 3 years without any problems.,1,20373
Lenovo Thinkpad,5579,,,,,,,,"The current ThinkPad I am using is more on the budget end my personal laptop, so will not be a good comparison for me to make.",1,20374
Lenovo Thinkpad,5580,,,,,,,,hi thanks for sharing..,1,20375
Lenovo Thinkpad,5580,,,,,,,,"upon looking at it the amd 745 G6 isn't offered in SG, and it is alot pricier than the thinkpad counterpart.",1,20376
Lenovo Thinkpad,5580,,,,,,,,"for this month, it is just hard to decide, waiting for the zen2 mobiles for a better worth it buy.",1,20377
Lenovo Thinkpad,5581,,,,,,,,What¬¨√≠s a good price to pay for 2nd-hand T470s?,1,20378
Lenovo Thinkpad,5582,,,,,,,,I've been researching quite a bit,1,20379
Lenovo Thinkpad,5582,,,,,,,,and I've come to a conclusion...,1,20380
Lenovo Thinkpad,5582,,,,,,,,T490s vs T495s.,1,20381
Lenovo Thinkpad,5582,,,,,,,,If both are around the same price.,1,20382
Lenovo Thinkpad,5582,,,,,,,,Which would be better?,1,20383
Lenovo Thinkpad,5582,,,,,,,,I understand that the intel T490s has better battery life.,1,20384
Lenovo Thinkpad,5582,,,,,,,,Anyone have real life experience with this 2 comparison in terns of battery life differences?,1,20385
Lenovo Thinkpad,5583,,,,,,,,Intel,1,20386
Lenovo Thinkpad,5583,,,,,,,,if same price.,1,20387
Lenovo Thinkpad,5583,,,,,,,,Battery battery and has Thunderbolt 3 for added expansion capability such as eGPU.,1,20388
Lenovo Thinkpad,5583,,,,,,,,"Only thing you lose is modular WiFi card since it's soldered on, unlike the AMD version which is a removable card.",1,20389
Lenovo Thinkpad,5584,,,,,,,,intel has better battery life?,1,20390
Lenovo Thinkpad,5585,,,,,,,,"same here.. ordered a ""ready to ship"" laptop..",1,20391
Lenovo Thinkpad,5585,,,,,,,,it said within 2 weeks..,1,20392
Lenovo Thinkpad,5585,,,,,,,,now it shows May 15..,1,20393
Lenovo Thinkpad,5585,,,,,,,,feel like scammed..,1,20394
Lenovo Thinkpad,5586,,,,,,,,"I think when you say same price, what are the specs that you are looking at?",1,20395
Lenovo Thinkpad,5586,,,,,,,,Generally any Intel laptop will cost more than one that runs AMD chips.,1,20396
Lenovo Thinkpad,5586,,,,,,,,And it is also generally true that the current AMD APU is not as power efficient as compared to an Intel equivalent.,1,20397
Lenovo Thinkpad,5586,P,,,,,,,However the AMD integrated GPU is significantly faster.,1,20398
Lenovo Thinkpad,5586,,,,,,,,So it depends on your usage.,1,20399
Lenovo Thinkpad,5587,P,,,,,,,i think nowadays they ship faster.,1,20400
Lenovo Thinkpad,5587,,,,,,,,i ordered 2 weeks ago then yesterday informed me that they have shipped and scheduled to arrive this saturday.,1,20401
Lenovo Thinkpad,5588,,,,,,,,what freebies are you guy able to ask to waive off?,1,20402

Lenovo Thinkpad,5589,,,,,,,,June smlj sia...,1,20407
Lenovo Thinkpad,5589,,,,,,,,"from May, to Apr now June.. help la",1,20408
Lenovo Thinkpad,5589,,,,,,,,who can I call/contact to F?,1,20409
Lenovo Thinkpad,5589,,,,,,,,I alr emailed them,1,20410
Lenovo Thinkpad,5590,,,,,,,,"I think its a shortage of parts, not just limited to Lenovo.",1,20411
Lenovo Thinkpad,5590,,,,,,,,I recently purchased an Acer laptop 25th Mar with Intel i5 8250U also got delayed till early May.,1,20412

Lenovo Thinkpad,5591,,,,,,,,"the only ""shortage"" at the customization page is the Ethernet dongle and 65W charger.",1,20415
Lenovo Thinkpad,5591,,,,,,,,Both of which are actually external devices..,1,20416
Lenovo Thinkpad,5591,,,,,,,,the cpu I chose doesn't show a shortage.,1,20417
Lenovo Thinkpad,5591,,,,,,,,neither does the ssd,1,20418
Lenovo Thinkpad,5591,,,,,,,,the 256gb one has a waiting time.,1,20419
Lenovo Thinkpad,5591,,,,,,,,but I chose 512.,1,20420
Lenovo Thinkpad,5591,,,,,,,,"also, did you cancel the order or did they cancel it for you?",1,20421
Lenovo Thinkpad,5592,,,,,,,,"Waiting for third generation Ryzen 4000 series to be inside the ThinkPad, will hoot the highest spec!",1,20422

Lenovo Thinkpad,5594,,,,,,,,Same for me.,1,20425
Lenovo Thinkpad,5594,,,,,,,,Bought the t495s estimated delivery date in June.,1,20426
Lenovo Thinkpad,5594,,,,,,,,Ask them to cancel,1,20427
Lenovo Thinkpad,5594,,,,,,,,but they ask me if I wanna proceed with a gst waive,1,20428
Lenovo Thinkpad,5595,,,,,,,,Looking at around the same spec.,1,20429
Lenovo Thinkpad,5595,,,,,,,,T490s Intel i5 vs T495s Ryzen 5.,1,20430
Lenovo Thinkpad,5595,,,,,,,A,Just that intel model I¬¨√≠m thinking of buying a slightly second hand at around the same price as a new t495s,1,20431
Lenovo Thinkpad,5596,,,,,,,,"True, but they cannot ship you a laptop without a charger.",1,20432
Lenovo Thinkpad,5597,,,,,,,,"I actually don't think you need the highest specs, especially when you are looking at the 15W chips.",1,20433
Lenovo Thinkpad,5597,,,,,,,,Most should find the R7 4700U with HT/ SMT sufficient and have a good balance between a good CPU and GPU.,1,20434
Lenovo Thinkpad,5597,,,,,,,,Most 15W chips are simply too power starved to maintain a good boost when both the CPU and GPU are under load.,1,20435
Lenovo Thinkpad,5597,,,,,,,,"They can likely boost up to 25W, but depends on the cooling solution.",1,20436
Lenovo Thinkpad,5598,,,,,,,,did u email or call them?,1,20437
Lenovo Thinkpad,5598,,,,,,,,My ETA keeps changing,1,20438
Lenovo Thinkpad,5598,,,,,,,,so idk what to do anymore...,1,20439

Lenovo Thinkpad,5598,,,,,,,,isn't it paired with the laptop?,1,20442
Lenovo Thinkpad,5598,,,,,,,,EDIT: Just called them.,1,20443
Lenovo Thinkpad,5598,,,,,,,,Apparently there's a CPU shortage.,1,20444
Lenovo Thinkpad,5598,,,,,,,,the rest of the parts are available.,1,20445
Lenovo Thinkpad,5598,,,,,,,,"Also, I told them to mark my account as corporate as I do make purchases on behalf of my company at times",1,20446

Lenovo Thinkpad,5715,,,,,,,,Successor to the X395 isn't the X13 AMD meh?,1,20766
Lenovo Thinkpad,5716,,,,,,,,"3300u, 3500u or 3700u",1,20767
Lenovo Thinkpad,5717,,,,,,,,waiting for high end,1,20768
Lenovo Thinkpad,5717,,,,,,,,AMD Thinkpad,1,20769
Lenovo Thinkpad,5717,,,,,,,,but don't think it will happen anytime soon.,1,20770
Lenovo Thinkpad,5718,,,,,,,,Lenovo will never sell gaming laptops,1,20771
Lenovo Thinkpad,5719,,,,,,,,The Legion line is aimed at gamers.,1,20772
Lenovo Thinkpad,5719,,,,,,,,"There's also the L340, which was a low cost gaming laptop.",1,20773
Lenovo Thinkpad,5720,,,,,,,,"AMD mobile for so long, no manufacturer have push for high end.",1,20774
Lenovo Thinkpad,5720,,,,,,,,Generally AMD laptop are found in low cost or mid range laptops.,2,20775
Lenovo Thinkpad,5720,,,,,,,,but no high end.,2,20775
Lenovo Thinkpad,5721,,,,,,,,GTA is so playable evewn with renoir U,1,20776
Lenovo Thinkpad,5722,,,,,,,,whoa very impressive.,1,20777
Lenovo Thinkpad,5722,,,,,,,,if they can pair the 4800U with decent cooling.,1,20778
Lenovo Thinkpad,5722,,,,,,,P,this is gonna be a great AIO desktop or laptop,1,20779
Lenovo Thinkpad,5723,,,,,,,,a taste of what's to come?,1,20780
Lenovo Thinkpad,5724,,,,,,,,"I think with U , sure kena throttle......",1,20781
Lenovo Thinkpad,5724,,,,,,,,for intel at least la,1,20782
Lenovo Thinkpad,5725,,,,,,,,i think i just get the 4500U is sufficient liao,1,20783
Lenovo Thinkpad,5726,,,,,,,,I also think so..,1,20784
Lenovo Thinkpad,5726,,,,,,,,I'm also thinking of something like,1,20785
Lenovo Thinkpad,5726,,,,,,,,AsRock Deskmini A300 version  with Renoir A400 ?,1,20786
Lenovo Thinkpad,5727,,,,,,,,"Not for gaming but higher specs ThinkPad, like putting Ryzen 9, and good solid screen for content creation.",1,20787
Lenovo Thinkpad,5727,,,,,,,,Don't really want to buy P2 even now that intel had lowered their CPU prices by a lot.,1,20788
Lenovo Thinkpad,5728,,,,,,,,seems like there is no more ecoupon that can be used now.,1,20789
Lenovo Thinkpad,5729,,,,,,,,im using 2400G quite satisfied with performance.,1,20790
Lenovo Thinkpad,5729,,,,,,,,can play guild wars 2 on low at 50fps 4k resolution,1,20791
Lenovo Thinkpad,5730,,,,,,,,wait for it to update to renoir should be better,1,20792
Lenovo Thinkpad,5730,,,,,,,,i Feel,1,20793
Lenovo Thinkpad,5731,,,,,,,,save this as bookmark.,1,20794
Lenovo Thinkpad,5731,,,,,,,,once can order it will appear,1,20795
Lenovo Thinkpad,5732,,,,,,,,yup better.,1,20796
Lenovo Thinkpad,5732,,,,,,,,"Good thing about laptop and desktop apu is that it has vce for gpu acceleration when encoding video, something not found in low end nvidia like mx250",1,20797
Lenovo Thinkpad,5733,,,,,,,,"Just want to check,",1,20798
Lenovo Thinkpad,5733,,,,,,,,does the monitor that comes with the laptop support HDR?,1,20799
Lenovo Thinkpad,5733,,,,,,,,or how can I check it?,1,20800
Lenovo Thinkpad,5734,,,,,,,,4500u compared.,2,20801
Lenovo Thinkpad,5734,,,,,,,,15w and 25w,2,20801
Lenovo Thinkpad,5734,,,,,,,,5 deg C/1 to 2 fps difference,1,20802
Lenovo Thinkpad,5735,,,,,,,,think for 4500U leaving it at 15w better,1,20803
Lenovo Thinkpad,5736,,,,,,,,That's why I can't wait for the desktop version actually.,1,20804
Lenovo Thinkpad,5736,N,,,,,,,Most laptops unfortunately comes with poor cooling solution.,1,20805
Lenovo Thinkpad,5737,,,,,,,,Its not limited to Lenovo though.,1,20806
Lenovo Thinkpad,5737,,,,,,,,The same goes to all the PC manufacturers.,1,20807
Lenovo Thinkpad,5737,,,,,,,,"The top of the range is only limited to Intel processors, so you get a sense there is something fishy here.",1,20808
Lenovo Thinkpad,5738,,,,,,,,"I read about it sometime back, but it is very rare.",1,20809
Lenovo Thinkpad,5738,,,,,,,,"Most are limited to 400 nits, so HDR 400, which is negligible visually.",1,20810
Lenovo Thinkpad,5738,,,,,,,,I believe even the laptop OLED monitors are also limited to 400 nits based on specs.,1,20811
Lenovo Thinkpad,5739,,,,,,,,It is interesting that its only 2 FPS difference.,1,20812
Lenovo Thinkpad,5739,,,,,,,,"In the video, the CPU seems to be sustained at a much higher clockspeed on the 25W test.",1,20813
Lenovo Thinkpad,5739,,,,,,,,So the bottleneck is probably the GPU in this case.,1,20814
Lenovo Thinkpad,5740,,,,,,,,OEM agreements I guess.,1,20815
Lenovo Thinkpad,5740,,,,,,,,"you scratch my back, I scratch yours?",1,20816
Lenovo Thinkpad,5740,,,,,,,,I would build my own laptop tbh.,1,20817
Lenovo Thinkpad,5740,,,,,,,,but sg does not have that service.,1,20818
Lenovo Thinkpad,5740,,,,,,,,Mine is 300 nits.. but its not just about the brightness.,1,20819
Lenovo Thinkpad,5740,,,,,,,,"Its about the color gamut, or clarity right?",1,20820
Lenovo Thinkpad,5740,,,,,,,,instead of 8-bit its like 10-bit..,1,20821
Lenovo Thinkpad,5740,,,,,,,,but idk if my monitor has.,1,20822
Lenovo Thinkpad,5740,,,,,,,,how to check?,1,20823
Lenovo Thinkpad,5741,,,,,,,,Most build yourself laptops unfortunately are not as customizable as a PC.,1,20824
Lenovo Thinkpad,5741,,,,,,,,"Take Eurocom for example, they specializes in this sort of customization on a laptop.",1,20825
Lenovo Thinkpad,5741,,,,,,,,"However if you realized, the level of customization is still very limited.",1,20826
Lenovo Thinkpad,5741,,,,,,,,"For HDR, I don't think there is a way to check if it is HDR compliant.",1,20827
Lenovo Thinkpad,5741,,,,,,,,"You are correct to say that HDR is not just about brightness, but also the color reproduction of the screen.",1,20828
Lenovo Thinkpad,5741,,,,,,,,VESA standard suggests a minimal brightness level of 400 nits.,1,20829
Lenovo Thinkpad,5742,,,,,,,,Colour gamut can test using a colorimeter.,1,20830
Lenovo Thinkpad,5742,,,,,,,,"For Lenovo laptops, most are 45% NTSC or 72% NTSC",1,20831
Lenovo Thinkpad,5742,,,,,,,,100% sRGB.,1,20832
Lenovo Thinkpad,5742,,,,,,,,think the 4k displays all exceed 72% NTSC.,1,20833
Lenovo Thinkpad,5742,,,,,,,,Bit depth can check in display properties...,1,20834
Lenovo Thinkpad,5742,,,,,,,,But think most are still 8 bit.,1,20835
Lenovo Thinkpad,5742,,,,,,,,10 bit simply means less colour banding when displaying gradients.,1,20836
Lenovo Thinkpad,5743,,,,,,,,Hope to see Lenovo Singapore bringing in AMD Renoir based laptops soon.,1,20837
Lenovo Thinkpad,5744,,,,,,,,100% sRGB means 100% colour accuracy?,1,20838
Lenovo Thinkpad,5744,,,,,,,,"I guess aftershock is ""build yourself""..",1,20839
Lenovo Thinkpad,5744,,,,,,,,but its gaming only..,1,20840
Lenovo Thinkpad,5744,,,,,,,,they sg doesn't have a DIY for laptops like PCs..,1,20841
Lenovo Thinkpad,5745,,,,,,,,T495 400 nits panel has got good sRGB of 98.6% and an adobe RGB of 63.5%.,1,20842
Lenovo Thinkpad,5745,,,,,,,,Adobe RGB is not import if you are not doing offset printing.,1,20843
Lenovo Thinkpad,5745,,,,,,,,I do hope that have 500 nits with 100% sGRB.,1,20844
Lenovo Thinkpad,5746,,,,,,,,I bought X395.,1,20845
Lenovo Thinkpad,5746,,,,,,,,how do I check that?,1,20846
Lenovo Thinkpad,5747,,,,,,,,Aftershock's customization is not much of a customization.,1,20847
Lenovo Thinkpad,5747,,,,,,,,They have regressed over the years when it comes to customization.,1,20848
Lenovo Thinkpad,5747,,,,,,,,"As I understand, DIY laptops should be very rare, and should be very limited in terms of customization, unlike PCs.",1,20849
Lenovo Thinkpad,5747,,,,,,,,"This is because different specs/ features tend to have a different motherboard design, which in turn affects cooling solution and chassis design.",1,20850
Lenovo Thinkpad,5747,,,,,,,,"If ever you find one that allows you to customize freely, it will likely cost a lot.",1,20851
Lenovo Thinkpad,5748,,,,,,,,yea man!,1,20852
Lenovo Thinkpad,5748,,,,,,,,can't wait to see those thinkpads!,1,20853
Lenovo Thinkpad,5748,,,,,,,,hope they don't disappoint!,1,20854
Lenovo Thinkpad,5749,,,,,,,,I've been checking everyday since the start of May.,1,20855
Lenovo Thinkpad,5750,,,,,,,,seems like no high end,1,20856
Lenovo Thinkpad,5750,,,,,,,,AMD cpu variant for thinkpad.,2,20857
Lenovo Thinkpad,5750,,,,,,,,was hoping maybe the p series or xtreme series got the new amd cpu,2,20857
Lenovo Thinkpad,5751,,,,,,,,I believe its Intel at work in the background.,1,20858
Lenovo Thinkpad,5751,,,,,,,,"If so, what a dirty way of hindering competition.",1,20859
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,Might not be solely the reason.,1,20860
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,Lenovo might have signed different exclusive deals with Intel based on different product lines.,1,20861
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,Example,1,20862
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,T series 14 inches and 15 inches may have different contracts.,1,20863
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,14 inches exclusive deal ended and so Lenovo brought in AMD.,1,20864
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,"Another reason might be, Lenovo signed a deal to buy certain number of 15W, 25W and 45W CPU every year in order to secure CPU numbers.",1,20865
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,They might not be able to use up all 45W CPU from Intel and no point to buy more from AMD 45W variant if they cannot move on low volume products.,1,20866
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,Intel has a lack of CPU supply if any of you follow the news.,1,20867
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,"Big players like Dell, HP, Apple and Lenovo would likely sign deals that supply them certain numbers of CPU for not just 1 year, but typically 2-3 years.",1,20868
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,AMD scores product design wins mainly are the higher volume 15W Ryzen 3300U/3500U/3700U.,1,20869
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,"If I am Lenovo or one of the big players, I can afford to sell 10% of the sales from AMD Ryzen to 1 build up expertise in AMD system, 2 test market response, 3 meet market demand and 4 pressure Intel to give better renewal deals.",1,20870
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,"Remember, many people don¬¨√≠t know AMD.",1,20871
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,Reliability is a factor.,1,20872
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,You need a certain discount to attract buyers.,1,20873
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,A similar priced Intel whether on desktop or laptop can command a higher premium than AMD as seen in T series thinkpad.,1,20874
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,I have no doubt 45W Ryzen will come to ThinkPad T15 and P15 series in 1-2 years when corporate clients look for replacement units after having 2-3 years using Ryzen.,1,20875
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,Management approving wider use of Ryzen systems will be happy to take on 45W systems that command higher reliability.,1,20876
Lenovo Thinkpad,5752,,,,,,,,"If you are running a business and need critical support, would you use Singtel services or Grid Mobile?",1,20877
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,AMD Mobile products have not been popular since early days of Turion.,2,20878
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,till AMD FX Excavator CPU not the famous AMD FX-60 socket 939 which decimate Intel back in the early days.,2,20878
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,CPU have been weak and behind Intel counterpart so the selling point.,2,20879
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,isn't there.,2,20879
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,N,,,,,,,AMD perception have been tainted as slow and hot for so long,1,20880
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,thus many will not risk it to buy one.,1,20881
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,However the pricing.,2,20882
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,is one factor some will get it as most model falls below $1k.,2,20882
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,Market availability is also another question as AMD is exclusive.,2,20883
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,to US and China mainly.,2,20883
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,Only recent AMD Ryzen laptop than.,2,20884
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,more and more such laptop became to surface.,2,20884
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,However most model are either entry/mid but,1,20885
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,no high end.,2,20886
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,have surface.,2,20886
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,"Models like Dell G5 SE AMD Ryzen, Lenovo Legion 5",1,20887
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,so far no.,2,20888
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,news whether SG have them or not.,2,20888
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,A,I only know Dell SG do not bring in AMD based desktop/laptop as sales margin are generally poor.,1,20889
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,Asus as well as Lenovo are actively bringing in AMD Ryzen laptop followed by Acer and HP.,1,20890
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,I have owned AMD based laptops from Turion till the last one the AMD A10 series.,1,20891
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,Generally they are average performing laptop which cost less than $1k.,1,20892
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,I stop buying AMD laptops before Ryzen laptops were available here.,1,20893
Lenovo Thinkpad,5753,,,,,,,,I myself also hope to get a decent AMD 8 Core mobile laptop just waiting for the right model.,1,20894
Lenovo Thinkpad,5754,,,,,,,,what about Renoir 4k,1,20895
Lenovo Thinkpad,5754,,,,,,,,haha???,1,20896
Lenovo Thinkpad,5755,,,,,,,,Hi new to the forum here.,1,20897
Lenovo Thinkpad,5755,,,,,,,,I will be starting school in July and was thinking of getting a E495/E595.,1,20898
Lenovo Thinkpad,5755,,,,,,,,I am looking at Ryzen 3500 but hesitant to buy now as the Ryzen 4000 seems to be launching soon,1,20899
Lenovo Thinkpad,5755,,,,,,,,and Im waiting for a dip in price for the 3500 series.,1,20900
Lenovo Thinkpad,5755,,,,,,,,Any suggestions on how much it would drop in price?,1,20901
Lenovo Thinkpad,5755,,,,,,,,"Given the supply chain disruption now due to covid, do you guys suggest I wait it out for the 4000 or just go ahead with the purchase now.",1,20902
Lenovo Thinkpad,5756,,,,,,,,Agreed.,1,20903
Lenovo Thinkpad,5756,,,,,,,,"I recall having an AMD laptop quite a number of years back, but its been so long that I can't recall when as well.",1,20904
Lenovo Thinkpad,5756,,,,,,,,The reason for getting it was due a decent integrated graphics and low price.,1,20905
Lenovo Thinkpad,5756,,,,,,,,But I also recalled that it runs really hot.,1,20906
Lenovo Thinkpad,5756,,,,,,,,Those were tough years for AMD because Intel is always ahead of them when it comes to having an advance fab.,1,20907
Lenovo Thinkpad,5756,,,,,,,,I feel detaching themselves from Globabl Foundry,1,20908
Lenovo Thinkpad,5756,,,,,,,,actually helped AMD in the longer run.,1,20909
Lenovo Thinkpad,5757,,,,,,,,No harm waiting since it is expected to be available for order this month.,1,20910
Lenovo Thinkpad,5758,,,,,,,,"As mentioned, I recommend waiting.",1,20911
Lenovo Thinkpad,5758,,,,,,,,I just checked the price of current E495 and noticed it has gone up substantially.,1,20912
Lenovo Thinkpad,5758,,,,,,,,"I think even with base specs with a Ryzen 5 3500U, it will cost you over 1K.",1,20913
Lenovo Thinkpad,5758,,,,,,,,"Also, they removed some important upgrades like the IPS monitor option is gone.",1,20914
Lenovo Thinkpad,5759,,,,,,,,"Ok, will heed your advice and wait out for the a few more weeks.",1,20915
Lenovo Thinkpad,5759,,,,,,,,I also realized that about the customization option of E495!,1,20916
Lenovo Thinkpad,5759,,,,,,,,They downgraded the FHD IPS panel to a HD TN panel with no customization option now!,1,20917
Lenovo Thinkpad,5760,,,,,,,,"Either way you have wait, order will need at least 2 weeks or 4 weeks.",1,20918
Lenovo Thinkpad,5760,,,,,,,,I don't think price will drop a lot due to pandemic.,1,20919
Lenovo Thinkpad,5761,,,,,,,,Is there any promo code for Lenovo?,1,20920
Lenovo Thinkpad,5761,,,,,,,,I only found a 3% off online.,1,20921
Lenovo Thinkpad,5762,,,,,,,,The integrated Radeon Graphic was one of the key selling despite.,2,20922
Lenovo Thinkpad,5762,,,,,,,,the weak CPU.,2,20922
Lenovo Thinkpad,5762,,,,,,,,Another issue with later generation AMD laptop in particular A10/FX based,1,20923
Lenovo Thinkpad,5762,,,,,,,,laptops was drivers especially those with dual graphics.,1,20924
Lenovo Thinkpad,5762,,,,,,,,I had the Asus X550DP,1,20925
Lenovo Thinkpad,5762,,,,,,,,the dual graphics mean IGP + discrete graphic,1,20926
Lenovo Thinkpad,5762,,,,,,,,but keep crashing most of the time.,1,20927
Lenovo Thinkpad,5762,,,,,,,,No driver was released to fix such issue thus I dump the laptop.,1,20928
Lenovo Thinkpad,5763,,,,,,,,means the new versions are coming,1,20929
Lenovo Thinkpad,5764,,,,,,,,That is correct.,1,20930
Lenovo Thinkpad,5764,,,,,,,,"If I am not wrong, there are 2 versions of this graphic switching tech from AMD.",1,20931
Lenovo Thinkpad,5764,,,,,,,,One of the Lenovo laptop,1,20932
Lenovo Thinkpad,5764,,,,,,,,I owned back then,1,20933
Lenovo Thinkpad,5764,,,,,,,,had an Intel processor with an AMD graphic card.,1,20934
Lenovo Thinkpad,5764,,,,,,,,"For that laptop, I recall I had to manually switch graphics, unlike Optimus that switches automatically most of the time.",1,20935
Lenovo Thinkpad,5764,,,,,,,,The second gen was an auto switching one but it was very bad.,1,20936
Lenovo Thinkpad,5764,,,,,,,,I think they have no $$$ as they were getting hit left right center by both Intel and Nvidia.,1,20937
Lenovo Thinkpad,5765,,,,,,,,I was thinking the same.,1,20938
Lenovo Thinkpad,5765,,,,,,,,"To be honest, the wait is very painful.",1,20939
Lenovo Thinkpad,5765,,,,,,,,Lol.,1,20940
Lenovo Thinkpad,5766,,,,,,,,actually what is the price difference btw a entry monitor to a good one?,1,20941
Lenovo Thinkpad,5766,,,,,,,,100 top up enough?,1,20942
Lenovo Thinkpad,5766,,,,,,,,So far I've yet to see renoirs with better screens,1,20943
Lenovo Thinkpad,5767,,,,,,,,close to mx350 performance,1,20944
Lenovo Thinkpad,5768,,,,,,,,you mean for the thinkpad options?,1,20945
Lenovo Thinkpad,5768,,,,,,,,i'm guessing around that price also.,1,20946
Lenovo Thinkpad,5768,,,,,,,,100-200,1,20947
Lenovo Thinkpad,5769,,,,,,,,"I think it should be < $1,500 if it ever comes",1,20948
Lenovo Thinkpad,5769,,,,,,,,"but I think maybe looking at other brands too HP, Dell or Acer.",1,20949
Lenovo Thinkpad,5770,,,,,,,,Price difference for a better monitor is not significant.,1,20950
Lenovo Thinkpad,5770,,,,,,,,"However due to product segmentation, they may not offer you a better monitor.",1,20951
Lenovo Thinkpad,5771,,,,,,,,let's if dell will pick this up or not,1,20952
Lenovo Thinkpad,5772,,,,,,,,if you ask me at that pricing...,1,20953
Lenovo Thinkpad,5772,,,,,,,,thinkpads are still better than the other brands u mentioned.,1,20954
Lenovo Thinkpad,5772,,,,,,,,Somehow the overall build is just better than the rest..,1,20955
Lenovo Thinkpad,5772,,,,,,,,others may look nicer but,1,20956
Lenovo Thinkpad,5772,,,,,,,,the build and quality.. thinkpads still top notch imo.,1,20957
Lenovo Thinkpad,5773,,,,,,,,Is it worth buying a second hand thinkpad without warranty?,1,20958
Lenovo Thinkpad,5773,,,,,,,,Saw a E495 3500U and 16GB RAM going at $650.,1,20959
Lenovo Thinkpad,5773,,,,,,,,Anyone got experience in buying 2nd hand thinkpads?,1,20960
Lenovo Thinkpad,5773,,,,,,,,Is it easy to self-repair?,1,20961
Lenovo Thinkpad,5774,P,,,,,,,This integrated GPU is probably the most powerful at this point.,1,20962
Lenovo Thinkpad,5774,,,,,,,A,"I suspect it is due to the 7nm shrink that probably allow the GPU to run at a higher clockspeed, sustain at a higher clockspeed, and to a large extend, the inclusion of faster memory.",1,20963
Lenovo Thinkpad,5774,,,,,,,,I am looking foward to see how the iGPU,1,20964
Lenovo Thinkpad,5774,,,,,,,,in actual gaming benchmark agains the MX350.,1,20965
Lenovo Thinkpad,5774,P,,,,,,,"I believe it will be faster than a MX250, but likely still trailing the MX350.",1,20966
Lenovo Thinkpad,5774,,,,,,,,Still for a 15W chip to perform closely to a 15W,1,20967
Lenovo Thinkpad,5774,,,,,,,,+ 25W,1,20968
Lenovo Thinkpad,5774,,,,,,,,Intel solution is  a big deal.,1,20969
Lenovo Thinkpad,5774,,,,,,,,Nvidia certainly is aware scrambling to put up a new low power GPU in face of competitors' iGPU catching up with their aged GPU in the low power range.,1,20970
Lenovo Thinkpad,5775,,,,,,,,"E495 is relative new model release last year, you can call to get",1,20971

Lenovo Thinkpad,5775,,,,,,,,"RAM/SSD/HDD user still can do it, motherboard and LCD.",2,20975

Lenovo Thinkpad,5776,,,,,,,,largely mx350 still comes out top.,1,20977

Lenovo Thinkpad,5777,,,,,,,,if going for ultras,1,20979
Lenovo Thinkpad,5777,,,,,,,,i'm quite concern with throttling...,1,20980
Lenovo Thinkpad,5778,,,,,,,,This issue is unavoidable.,1,20981
Lenovo Thinkpad,5778,,,,,,,,Question is how bad will it throttle.,1,20982
Lenovo Thinkpad,5778,,,,,,,,"If you read recent review of the Acer Swift 3 with the Ryzen 7 4700U, the cooling system is very bad.",1,20983
Lenovo Thinkpad,5778,,,,,,,,"Even in my current E485, the heatsink is very small and you can clearly see it struggling to handle the heat.",1,20984
Lenovo Thinkpad,5779,,,,,,,,so is it possible to don't throttle?,1,20985
Lenovo Thinkpad,5779,,,,,,,,for example my lenovo S730 yoga multitask zoom also kena,1,20986
Lenovo Thinkpad,5780,,,,,,,,if they can pair the 4800u or 4800u with good cooling and dual channel.,1,20987
Lenovo Thinkpad,5780,,,,,,,,beasty,1,20988
Lenovo Thinkpad,5781,,,,,,,,hope we won't have the pro options only..,1,20989
Lenovo Thinkpad,5782,,,,,,,,"The throttling is really to help manage the heat, so I don't think it is ideal to stop it from throttling.",1,20990
Lenovo Thinkpad,5782,,,,,,,,All modern CPUs have a temperature in which it will shutdown to prevent permanent damage due to overheating.,1,20991

Lenovo Thinkpad,5782,,,,,,,,"Replace the thermal compound - I am using Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut
2.",1,20994
Lenovo Thinkpad,5782,,,,,,,,Try and see if I can add some heatsink/ increase cooling surface area if space  in the laptop permits.,2,20995
Lenovo Thinkpad,5782,,,,,,,,3,2,20995
Lenovo Thinkpad,5782,,,,,,,,Seal up gap between the heatsink and the exhaust if required - This will ensure hot air gets channeled out of the chassis directly and minimize hot air flowing back into the chassis,1,20996
Lenovo Thinkpad,5782,,,,,,,A,All these will help to a limited extend to allow a slightly longer boost.,1,20997
Lenovo Thinkpad,5782,,,,,,,,Throttling unfortunately is still inevitable.,1,20998
Lenovo Thinkpad,5783,,,,,,,,Yeah I saw this.,1,20999
Lenovo Thinkpad,5783,,,,,,,,What puts me off is the date.,1,21000
Lenovo Thinkpad,5783,,,,,,,,So I guess there may be delays in Renoir laptops.,1,21001
Lenovo Thinkpad,5784,,,,,,,,I think usually ultrabooks very susah,1,21002
Lenovo Thinkpad,5785,,,,,,,,covid covid,1,21003
Lenovo Thinkpad,5786,,,,,,,,For laptop u dun need to be on high clock speed all the time,1,21004
Lenovo Thinkpad,5786,,,,,,,,Sent from Rem Is Best Waifu using GAGT,1,21005
Lenovo Thinkpad,5787,,,,,,,,you try zoom on...,1,21006
Lenovo Thinkpad,5787,,,,,,,,it kept my total cpu @,1,21007
Lenovo Thinkpad,5787,,,,,,,,20%,1,21008
Lenovo Thinkpad,5788,,,,,,,A,It is true because the slimness means compromises made with cooling.,1,21009
Lenovo Thinkpad,5788,,,,,,,,"However they can still make an effort to provide a decent cooling solution, i.e. dual heatsink fan cooler.",1,21010
Lenovo Thinkpad,5788,,,,,,,,Dual heatsink helps because it provides more surface area despite the thin heatsink.,1,21011
Lenovo Thinkpad,5788,,,,,,,,"Low/ mid range thin laptops usually sport a single fan, a measly thin heatsink, and a single fat or 2 thin heatpipes.",1,21012
Lenovo Thinkpad,5788,,,,,,,,"As a result, any load on the CPU will quickly bring the temps up drastically.",1,21013
Lenovo Thinkpad,5789,,,,,,,,agreed..,1,21014
Lenovo Thinkpad,5789,,,,,,,,dual heatsink fan cooler..,1,21015
Lenovo Thinkpad,5789,,,,,,,,dunno why they like to provide lousy cooling solutions,1,21016
Lenovo Thinkpad,5790,,,,,,,,so can i assume dell xps 13 is the better ultrabook??,1,21017
Lenovo Thinkpad,5791,,,,,,,,I think it is confirmed for a June release.,1,21018
Lenovo Thinkpad,5791,,,,,,,,Hope they won't move the dates again.,1,21019
Lenovo Thinkpad,5791,,,,,,,A,"While I agree that COVID will impact release dates, but I feel it is a poorly coordinated effort by AMD.",1,21020
Lenovo Thinkpad,5791,,,,,,,,They should first confirm if there are sufficient products to sell before officially announcing it.,1,21021
Lenovo Thinkpad,5791,,,,,,,,It is like vaporware now since only reviewers seems to have them.,1,21022
Lenovo Thinkpad,5791,,,,,,,,On the contrary Intel managed to get the new processors into machines that are available to purchase.,1,21023
Lenovo Thinkpad,5791,,,,,,,,Unless of course there are conspiracy theories that Intel is behind the delays.,1,21024
Lenovo Thinkpad,5792,,,,,,,,"Yes, but it also comes with an eye watering price tag.",1,21025
Lenovo Thinkpad,5793,,,,,,,,Tomshardware took the Acer Swift 3 apart.,1,21026
Lenovo Thinkpad,5793,N,,,,,,,There you can see the poor cooling solution which is standard issue for most low power processors.,1,21027
Lenovo Thinkpad,5793,,,,,,,,Unfortunately what they did not show is how thin the heatsink is.,1,21028
Lenovo Thinkpad,5793,,,,,,,,"There is actually space for better cooling in this chassis, but of course they choose the cheap option.",1,21029
Lenovo Thinkpad,5794,,,,,,,,damn.. was hoping a mid may release.,1,21030
Lenovo Thinkpad,5795,,,,,,,,so if got 2 fans means half the battle won liao hor,1,21031
Lenovo Thinkpad,5796,,,,,,,,I think can wait and see.,1,21032
Lenovo Thinkpad,5796,,,,,,,,The link seems to refer only to ThinkPad and not to IdeaPad.,1,21033
Lenovo Thinkpad,5796,,,,,,,,So perhaps you can still find an IdeaPad with an Renoir in it this month since it is already available for selected countries.,1,21034
Lenovo Thinkpad,5797,,,,,,,,That means sustained performance should be better with more surface area for cooling.,1,21035
Lenovo Thinkpad,5798,,,,,,,,I have the latest Dell XPS 9300,1,21036
Lenovo Thinkpad,5798,,,,,,,,and it is hot AF even with the dual heatsink or whatever.,1,21037
Lenovo Thinkpad,5798,,,,,,,,A bit regret paying so much for this.,1,21038
Lenovo Thinkpad,5798,,,,,,,,The saving grace is that Dell support is awesome.,1,21039
Lenovo Thinkpad,5798,,,,,,,,I accidentally scratched my screen somehow and broke my microsd slot long story--for some reason,1,21040
Lenovo Thinkpad,5798,,,,,,,,", my microSD card kept getting stuck inside and dell is replacing them for free under accidental damage...",1,21041
Lenovo Thinkpad,5799,,,,,,,,I actually considered XPS13 before settling down for the thinkpad X395.,1,21042
Lenovo Thinkpad,5799,,,,,,,,Apparently XPS' standards have dropped and quality too..,1,21043
Lenovo Thinkpad,5799,,,,,,,,and the price is not worth it according to a few people I spoke to.,1,21044
Lenovo Thinkpad,5800,,,,,,,,so probably need to search for vendor that has dual fans +,1,21045
Lenovo Thinkpad,5800,,,,,,,,good screen for the renoir 4k then?,1,21046
Lenovo Thinkpad,5801,,,,,,,,"tbh, I don't see the point of 4K on a laptop.",1,21047
Lenovo Thinkpad,5801,,,,,,,,drains too much battery.,1,21048
Lenovo Thinkpad,5801,,,,,,,,2k also considered too much alr on such a small screen..,1,21049
Lenovo Thinkpad,5802,,,,,,,,4k on renoir?,1,21050
Lenovo Thinkpad,5802,,,P,,,,,i'll still take a great full HD screen for now.,1,21051
Lenovo Thinkpad,5802,,,,,,,,at 14 or 15 inch.,1,21052
Lenovo Thinkpad,5802,,,,,,,,4k still is overkill.,2,21053
Lenovo Thinkpad,5802,,,,,,,,unless the battery can max out on the laptop which i don't think they will.,2,21053
Lenovo Thinkpad,5802,,,,,,,A,hopefully one day integrated graphics will be so good that great screens with fast refresh rate will be the norm.,1,21054
Lenovo Thinkpad,5802,,,,,,,,We will likely see more benefits for the avg consumer over 4k,1,21055
Lenovo Thinkpad,5803,,,,,,,,ok la even phone also have 4k display,1,21056
Lenovo Thinkpad,5804,,,,,,,,"honesty, hows the screen panel on the tp x395?",1,21057
Lenovo Thinkpad,5804,,,,,,,,i remember most thinkpads like those in my office have absolute garbage screen panels.,1,21058
Lenovo Thinkpad,5805,,,,,,,,Your office using IPS or TN panel?,1,21059
Lenovo Thinkpad,5805,,,,,,,,Upgrade to FHD and it will be IPS.,1,21060
Lenovo Thinkpad,5805,,,,,,,,If using HD only it is TN and TN is garbage,1,21061
Lenovo Thinkpad,5806,,,,,,,,yea but got difference ma?,1,21062
Lenovo Thinkpad,5806,,,,,,,,maybe if use for VR than the extra pixels will help..,1,21063
Lenovo Thinkpad,5807,,,,,,,,True even on IGP it is still demanding.,1,21064
Lenovo Thinkpad,5807,,,,,,,,"1080p will do fine for most laptop, if need 4K just use external monitor.",1,21065
Lenovo Thinkpad,5807,,,,,,,,"Anyway for 4K smaller the screen size, amount of detail isn't very obvious.",1,21066
Lenovo Thinkpad,5807,,,,,,,,"Recommend size for 4K contents is 50"" and above.",1,21067
Lenovo Thinkpad,5808,,,,,,,,Thinkpad IPS is garbage too and TN should not be an option at all.,1,21068
Lenovo Thinkpad,5808,,,,,,,,"They need to do better, screen is something you look at daily.",1,21069
Lenovo Thinkpad,5809,,,,,,,,Why do you need a 4K laptop screen though?,1,21070
Lenovo Thinkpad,5809,,,,,,,,"Even at 1440p, you will need to scale the image up by 200% to see properly, and that is if Windows can scale it correctly.",1,21071
Lenovo Thinkpad,5809,,,,,,,,4K in my opinion is not useful on a laptop.,1,21072
Lenovo Thinkpad,5810,,,,,,,,You can get up to an OLED screen on ThinkPads if you think the IPS is bad.,1,21073
Lenovo Thinkpad,5810,,,,,,,,"At the top end range, they will use good IPS screen.",1,21074
Lenovo Thinkpad,5810,,,,,,,,"At the mid and low end, don't expect them to give you super good screens.",1,21075
Lenovo Thinkpad,5810,,,,,,,,"Higher backlight, yes, but color reproduction is still going to be just average.",1,21076
Lenovo Thinkpad,5811,,,,,,,,I guess it is a side effect of being extremely thin.,1,21077
Lenovo Thinkpad,5811,,,,,,,,But thanks for the heads up.,1,21078
Lenovo Thinkpad,5812,,,,,,,,4K is still uncommon on mobile phone.,1,21079
Lenovo Thinkpad,5812,,,,,,,,So far only Sony have been pushing out mobile phones with 4K screen to try and differentiate themselves.,1,21080
Lenovo Thinkpad,5812,,,,,,,,"However, I don't find it a meaningful upgrade.",1,21081
Lenovo Thinkpad,5812,,,,,,,,People would like 4K screen for watching movies or playing games in higher definition.,1,21082
Lenovo Thinkpad,5812,,,,,,,,"In both use cases, I won't want to use a 6 to 7 inch mobile phone if given a choice.",1,21083
Lenovo Thinkpad,5812,,,,,,,,Also the mobile OS handles the image scaling very well.,1,21084
Lenovo Thinkpad,5812,,,,,,,,This is not the case with Windows.,1,21085
Lenovo Thinkpad,5812,,,,,,,,"It works in most cases, but when it does not work with say and older application, you are left with super small image/ fonts which you cannot read due to the size.",1,21086
Lenovo Thinkpad,5813,,,,,,,,"I don't need OLED I just want a good IPS, is that not fair enough?",1,21087
Lenovo Thinkpad,5813,,,,,,,,I am always buying AMD thinkpad yearly since ryzen.,1,21088
Lenovo Thinkpad,5813,,,,,,,,If they put amd in 1 carbon or p2 wokstation I will by it.,1,21089
Lenovo Thinkpad,5814,,,,,,,,Which doesn't make sense to me.,1,21090
Lenovo Thinkpad,5814,,,,,,,A,"If you feel the monitor is not great, you have the option not to buy from Lenovo isn't it?",1,21091
Lenovo Thinkpad,5814,,,,,,,,Instead you buy them yearly for a product that does not suit one of your main requirement.,1,21092
Lenovo Thinkpad,5814,,,,,,,,"Having a decent screen is one of the key requirements for me as well, though I suppose my expectation is not as high as yours.",1,21093
Lenovo Thinkpad,5814,,,,,,,,"As long as it is not a crappy TN or HD resolution screen, I think it is good enough for me considering that I am not paying top dollars for it.",1,21094
Lenovo Thinkpad,5814,,,,,,,,"The E485 has got a pretty alright screen to me, though I am disappointed with the super dim screen.",1,21095
Lenovo Thinkpad,5814,,,,,,,,"I can still accept it because I paid below 700 bucks for it, knowing very well that 700 bucks can only get me laptops with super low end specs in the Intel camp.",1,21096
Lenovo Thinkpad,5814,,,,,,,,"Anyway, I think it is likely you won't see AMD chips in high end models anytime soon.",1,21097
Lenovo Thinkpad,5814,,,,,,,,Intel made sure of that.,1,21098
Lenovo Thinkpad,5815,,,,,,,,so actually which ultrabook is good.,2,21099
Lenovo Thinkpad,5815,,,,,,,,or we should not go them..,2,21099
Lenovo Thinkpad,5815,,,,,,,,just get those that are a tad bigger?,1,21100
Lenovo Thinkpad,5816,,,,,,,,Tbh.,1,21101
Lenovo Thinkpad,5816,,,,,,,A,Ultrabook usually will skimp somewhere just to make it thin and light.,1,21102
Lenovo Thinkpad,5816,,,,,,,,And usually it is the cooling department,1,21103
Lenovo Thinkpad,5816,,,,,,,,cause it is the biggest.,1,21104
Lenovo Thinkpad,5816,,,,,,,,It is also design to throttle when it hit high temps.,1,21105
Lenovo Thinkpad,5816,,,,,,,,Usually people buy ultrabook,1,21106
Lenovo Thinkpad,5816,,,,,,,,"is really for portability, the rest is just a bonus.",1,21107
Lenovo Thinkpad,5816,,,,,,,,To me my first notebook is from compaq.,1,21108
Lenovo Thinkpad,5816,,,,,,,,And those days a 14inch lappy is minimally 2.4kg.,1,21109
Lenovo Thinkpad,5816,,,,P,,,,"Now even the E595 that i just bought, a 15inch is even lighter than the older ones.",1,21110
Lenovo Thinkpad,5816,,,,N,,,,And i dont find 1.7kg heavy to even carry around anymore.,1,21111
Lenovo Thinkpad,5817,,,,,,,,"Saving few hundred grams to sacrifice the number of ports,",1,21112
Lenovo Thinkpad,5817,,,,,,,,money n,3,21113
Lenovo Thinkpad,5817,,,,,,,,reduced specs is definitely a no no for most.,3,21113
Lenovo Thinkpad,5817,,,,,,,,Sent from Rem Best Grill using GAGT,3,21113
Lenovo Thinkpad,5818,,,,,,,,It depends on what you are looking out for.,1,21114
Lenovo Thinkpad,5818,,,,,,,,"If it is portability, Ultrabook is an option.",1,21115
Lenovo Thinkpad,5818,,,,,,,,"If not Ultrabook, then you need to ask yourself what is an acceptable weight for you.",1,21116
Lenovo Thinkpad,5818,,,,,,,,"For performance, Ultrabook is certainly out of the question.",1,21117
Lenovo Thinkpad,5818,,,,,,,,"In my case, I have a laptop for work and in case I need to bring it out.",1,21118
Lenovo Thinkpad,5818,,,,,,,A,"For heavy load, I leave it to my desktop.",1,21119
Lenovo Thinkpad,5818,,,,,,,,"I am fine with a heavier laptop, i.e. over 2kg.",1,21120
Lenovo Thinkpad,5818,,,,,,,,"As long as I can use it comfortably and the battery life is decent, I am good.",1,21121
Lenovo Thinkpad,5819,,,,,,,,Actually I don't think this is true.,1,21122
Lenovo Thinkpad,5819,,,,,,,,"If there is no market for ultra portables, then most companies will not go through the trouble of creating and designing more Ultrabooks.",1,21123
Lenovo Thinkpad,5819,,,,,,,,Think how well Apple is selling their Macbook Air and Macbooks,1,21124
Lenovo Thinkpad,5819,,,,,,,,and you get a sense.,1,21125
Lenovo Thinkpad,5819,,,,,,,,I do agree with you,1,21126
Lenovo Thinkpad,5819,,,,,,,,I am no fan of being dependent on dongles for connectivity.,1,21127
Lenovo Thinkpad,5820,,,,,,,,4k screen wise.,1,21128
Lenovo Thinkpad,5820,,,,,,,,Don't get Lenovo.,1,21129
Lenovo Thinkpad,5820,,,,,,,,Their 4k screens have a major issue with image retention.,1,21130
Lenovo Thinkpad,5820,,,,,,,,"After the circuit breaker, try this: go to a best denki etc store and on a Lenovo 4k laptop, open Microsoft Paint.",1,21131
Lenovo Thinkpad,5820,,,,,,,,Use the paint bucket to fill the background grey.,1,21132
Lenovo Thinkpad,5820,,,,,,,,"You will notice the desktop wallpaper ""burnt in"" as the background.",1,21133
Lenovo Thinkpad,5820,,,,,,,,"So far I saw this issue on Lenovo S940, C940 and S740 display sets.",1,21134
Lenovo Thinkpad,5820,,,,,,,,I had the S740,1,21135
Lenovo Thinkpad,5820,,,,,,,,previously also and had dead pixel issues.,1,21136
Lenovo Thinkpad,5820,,,,,,,,"I think for Lenovo, stick with the Full HD 100% sRGB/72% NTSC screens.",1,21137
Lenovo Thinkpad,5820,,,,,,,,4k oled also,1,21138

Lenovo Thinkpad,5821,,,,,,,,Now the situation is better alr.,1,21146
Lenovo Thinkpad,5821,,,,,,,,Just make sure you get the IPS with 72% NTSC/100% sRGB should be safe.,1,21147

Lenovo Thinkpad,5822,,,,,,,,I'm currentyly using an ultrabook.,1,21149

Lenovo Thinkpad,5822,,,,,,,,since now WFH seems like not so useful.,1,21151
Lenovo Thinkpad,5822,,,,,,,,didn't like it being hot,1,21152

Lenovo Thinkpad,5823,,,,,,,,I do simple basic tasks on my new ultrabook,1,21155

Lenovo Thinkpad,5823,,,,,,,,the term stays the same.,1,21161
Lenovo Thinkpad,5823,,,,P,,,,but its really getting lighter,1,21162
Lenovo Thinkpad,5824,,,,,,,,That is true.,1,21163
Lenovo Thinkpad,5824,,,,,,,A,"Back when Intel created this ""Ultrabook"", most slim laptops below 2kg can fall in the category.",1,21164
Lenovo Thinkpad,5824,,,,,,,A,"Fast forward to recent couple of years, all the PC manufacturer is pulling an Apple, and going crazy making it light and slim.",1,21165
Lenovo Thinkpad,5824,,,,,,,A,"I don't mind light and slim, but the quest for ever lighter and slimmer laptop needs to stop because it is becoming counter productive when it comes to performance.",1,21166

Lenovo Thinkpad,5825,,,,,,,,"If productivity is more important, look for T or X series with TDP set to 25w.",1,21171
Lenovo Thinkpad,5826,,,,P,,,,For me I really like light and slim....,1,21172
Lenovo Thinkpad,5826,,,,,N,,,"Back in 2012 when I first entered uni, I bought a 14 inch laptop which weighed a whopping 2.3kg and had poor batt life",1,21173

Lenovo Thinkpad,5826,,,,,,,A,"Also don't forget, while we have thin and light laptops, there are still more powerful laptops available with 25w+ processors.",1,21177
Lenovo Thinkpad,5827,,,,,,,,Thats the problem.,1,21178
Lenovo Thinkpad,5827,,,,P,,,,Going thinner and thinner and lighter,1,21179
Lenovo Thinkpad,5827,,,,,,,,every gen.,1,21180

Lenovo Thinkpad,5827,,,,,,,,"Even if one put a 25w processor, it will throttle.",1,21184
Lenovo Thinkpad,5827,,,,,,,,And when it throttles the performance take a dip.,1,21185
Lenovo Thinkpad,5827,,,,,,,,Then comes to whats the point here for ultrabook?,1,21186

Lenovo Thinkpad,5827,,,,,,,,"Anything more, with prolong heat of the processor is just gonna shorten the lifespan of it.",1,21188
Lenovo Thinkpad,5827,,,,,,,A,"Yes it may be light, with a lot of usb ports sacrificed, one has to spend more money again on dongles and extension ports.",1,21189
Lenovo Thinkpad,5827,,,,,,,,Another issue would be expansion of other memory modules.,1,21190
Lenovo Thinkpad,5827,,,,,,,,Most ultrabooks comes with embedded ram modules.,1,21191

Lenovo Thinkpad,5831,,,,,,,,ultrabooks are not what you want if u want performance for a laptop.,1,21214
Lenovo Thinkpad,5831,,,,,,,,there are high perf laptops that give 45W processors with decent cooling.,1,21215
Lenovo Thinkpad,5831,,,,,,,,Albeit heavier than an ultrabook..,1,21216

Lenovo Thinkpad,5834,,,,,,,,This is the problem.,1,21226
Lenovo Thinkpad,5834,,,,P,,,,"Regardless of model/ series, the laptop is getting slimmer and lighter with each passing year.",1,21227
Lenovo Thinkpad,5834,,,,P,,,,Even the DTR are slimmer and lighter based on my observation.,1,21228
Lenovo Thinkpad,5834,,,,,,,,"As a result, many are barely able to keep the components cool, losing ports, or losing upgradeability",1,21229
Lenovo Thinkpad,5834,,,,,,,,"i.e. the current T series comes with 1 soldered RAM, and only 1 to upgrade.",1,21230
Lenovo Thinkpad,5835,,,,,,,,I agree Ultrabooks are not for performance.,1,21231
Lenovo Thinkpad,5835,N,,,,,,,"But noting that the components are getting more power hungry, yet the chassis for all laptops are getting slimmer, at some point performance is going to be badly capped.",1,21232
Lenovo Thinkpad,5835,,,,,,,,Chip makers have come up with creative ways to manage the heat by giving it boost capabilities if there is thermal legroom.,1,21233
Lenovo Thinkpad,5835,,,,,,,,But these are just bursty clockspeed bumps and generally don't sustain in any laptop.,1,21234
Lenovo Thinkpad,5835,,,,,,,,A quick look at all the Intel/AMD chips of recent years and you can see the trend.,1,21235
Lenovo Thinkpad,5835,,,,,,,,Renoir seems to have bucked the trend somewhat even though they have a boost speed because the shrink to 7nm certainly helps thermally and able to sustain at a fairly high clockspeed.,1,21236
Lenovo Thinkpad,5836,,,,,,,,Bloatware can't really be helped for an organization if it is for security reasons.,1,21237
Lenovo Thinkpad,5836,,,,,,,,I used to have a corporate laptop that takes a solid 10 mins to boot up because of the number of security apps that it needs to load.,1,21238
Lenovo Thinkpad,5836,,,,,,,,"That laptop uses an SSD by the way, and not some mechanical hard drive.",1,21239
Lenovo Thinkpad,5836,,,,,,,,So you can imagine the number of bloatwares.,1,21240
Lenovo Thinkpad,5837,,,,,,,,Lol my wife t490 corp lappy really wols despite the ssd being used.,1,21241
Lenovo Thinkpad,5837,,,,,,,,The vpn the antivirus they used requires a lot of resources.,1,21242
Lenovo Thinkpad,5838,,,,,,,,There may a few security/ anti-virus being installed.,1,21243
Lenovo Thinkpad,5839,,,,,,,,This is not a problem.,1,21244
Lenovo Thinkpad,5839,,,,,,,,Just because one person likes to eat Chinese food and not western food does not make him/her a problem.,1,21245
Lenovo Thinkpad,5839,,,,,,,,You can get a gaming laptop with 45w CPU.,1,21246
Lenovo Thinkpad,5839,,,,,,,,"I definitely prefer bringing out a 1.2kg ultrabook, a USB c cable and an adapter weighting less than 200g for my work.",1,21247
Lenovo Thinkpad,5839,,,,,,,,"If you need a sustained CPU power, you need a 45w processor",1,21248
Lenovo Thinkpad,5840,,,,,,,,Is it not enough memory?,1,21249
Lenovo Thinkpad,5841,,,,,,,,I don't believe it is a memory issue anymore.,1,21250
Lenovo Thinkpad,5841,P,,,,,,,"While it only has 12GB of RAM, my old personal laptop only have 8GB and boots significantly faster.",1,21251
Lenovo Thinkpad,5841,,,,,,,N,The problem is the security softwares are very resource heavy.,1,21252
Lenovo Thinkpad,5841,,,,,,,,I suspect it is actually scanning before it loads.,1,21253
Lenovo Thinkpad,5841,,,,,,,,Otherwise I don't see why it takes that long to boot into a usable state.,1,21254
Lenovo Thinkpad,5842,,,,,,,,I think you are not getting what I said.,1,21255
Lenovo Thinkpad,5842,,,,,,,,I said it is not just an Ultrabook problem.,1,21256
Lenovo Thinkpad,5842,,,,,,,,"Look around you, all the laptops are losing weight and size.",1,21257
Lenovo Thinkpad,5842,,,,,,,,"Sure 45W laptops are bigger in size, but still compare it with 2 years ago, they definitely lost weight.",1,21258
Lenovo Thinkpad,5842,,,,,,,A,This slimming exercise is not just limited to Ultrabook.,1,21259
Lenovo Thinkpad,5842,,,,,,,,"If you read any 45W laptop reviews, most of them can't sustain the supposed high clockspeed.",1,21260
Lenovo Thinkpad,5842,,,,,,,,"I am not expecting it to run at full boost speed, but even at the base speed they struggle.",1,21261
Lenovo Thinkpad,5842,,,,,,,,"Power they certainly have enough, but cooling, no.",1,21262
Lenovo Thinkpad,5842,,,,,,,,"PC makers try to go around the problem but slapping more heatpipes, but that does not solve the problem of the small heatsink that are the bottleneck.",1,21263
Lenovo Thinkpad,5843,,,,,,,A,"so probably if one is OK with standard NB non ultras and NOT desktop replacement , it might be better to get these  since they are now like say slightly more than 1.5kg",1,21264
Lenovo Thinkpad,5843,,,,,,,,as compared to prev prev prev gen...,1,21265
Lenovo Thinkpad,5844,,,,,,,,"Hi guys, any laptop is worth to buy right now ?",1,21266
Lenovo Thinkpad,5844,,,,,,,A,Looking for a laptop that is light,1,21267
Lenovo Thinkpad,5844,,,,,,,,and I don¬¨√≠t have the habit of Gaming.,1,21268
Lenovo Thinkpad,5844,,,,,,,,Is Asus Zenbook 2020 a good choice at $1800?,1,21269
Lenovo Thinkpad,5845,,,,,,,,I owned 1st gen UX 21 before.,1,21270
Lenovo Thinkpad,5845,,,,,,,,Love it and easily carried around.,1,21271
Lenovo Thinkpad,5845,,,,,,,,Good pricing and portability.,1,21272
Lenovo Thinkpad,5845,,,,,,,,"No problem with it but as norm, battery failed after few yrs and good excuse to upgrade.",1,21273
Lenovo Thinkpad,5845,,,,,,,,"Currently, I am also looking at Zenbook 13 or 14 but holding back for 4000s.",1,21274
Lenovo Thinkpad,5846,,,,,,,,This series no longer worth it,1,21275
Lenovo Thinkpad,5846,,,,,,,,You guys promoted this too much on hwz.,2,21276
Lenovo Thinkpad,5846,,,,,,,,Market spoilers,2,21276
Lenovo Thinkpad,5847,,,,,,,,I would avoid the ZenBook for one simple reason -- it cannot charge through USB-C.,1,21277
Lenovo Thinkpad,5847,,,,,,,,I would try the Acer Swift 5 instead for the price.,1,21278
Lenovo Thinkpad,5847,,,,,,,,"Or if you can wait, wait for the Renoir series or the upcoming refreshed HP Envy 13 which now has a Thunderbolt port and has much smaller footprint than before.",1,21279
Lenovo Thinkpad,5848,,,,,,,,whats going on?,1,21280
Lenovo Thinkpad,5849,,,,,,,,"Look, it is an Intel thing",1,21281
Lenovo Thinkpad,5849,,,,,,,,When was the last time you see a laptop not throttle?,1,21282
Lenovo Thinkpad,5849,,,,,,,,You need to run on the Low power CPU like 5-10w in order for it not to throttle significantly due to huge heat created.,1,21283
Lenovo Thinkpad,5849,,,,,,,,"Intel 45w TDP and AMD 45w TDP are very different, with Ryzen much cooler.",1,21284
Lenovo Thinkpad,5849,,,,,,,,You can check the desktop parts you will know.,1,21285
Lenovo Thinkpad,5849,,,,,,,,"Well, wait for Ryzen 4000 45w APU.",1,21286
Lenovo Thinkpad,5849,,,,,,,,Asus G14 is promising.,1,21287
Lenovo Thinkpad,5850,,,,,,,,That's because I have configured the highest priced screen,1,21288
Lenovo Thinkpad,5850,,,,,,,A,"but I want a better screen still, and other brands don't have thinkpad keyboard.",1,21289
Lenovo Thinkpad,5851,,,,,,,A,Anyone getting Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5 with Ryzen 7 4700U?,1,21290
Lenovo Thinkpad,5851,,,,,,,,There's a flash deal that just started on Lazada for 1 day only.,1,21291
Lenovo Thinkpad,5852,,,,,,,,ME! been eyeing!@@@,1,21292
Lenovo Thinkpad,5853,,,,,,,,I don't think there is official Lenovo warranty though.,1,21293
Lenovo Thinkpad,5853,,,,,,,,But it's a good price.,1,21294
Lenovo Thinkpad,5853,,,,,,,,Can someone buy and test whether 4k@60hz over DP works?,1,21295
Lenovo Thinkpad,5853,,,,,,,,Lol,1,21296
Lenovo Thinkpad,5854,,,,,,,,this one right?,1,21297
Lenovo Thinkpad,5855,,,,,,,,Yeah !,1,21298
Lenovo Thinkpad,5855,,,,,,,,Indeed it's very tempting Ô£ø√º¬ß¬£,1,21299
Lenovo Thinkpad,5856,,,,,,,,Yup!,1,21300
Lenovo Thinkpad,5856,,,,,,,,Indeed tempting offer.,1,21301
Lenovo Thinkpad,5857,,,,,,,,it is worth because base model 4500u and 1 year warranty is 1.4k,1,21302
Lenovo Thinkpad,5858,,,,,,,,Base model is out in Singapore?,1,21303
Lenovo Thinkpad,5859,,,,,,,,Its a good deal to me.,1,21304
Lenovo Thinkpad,5859,,,,,,,,I suspect it will cost more if you configure it over at Lenovo's site.,1,21305
Lenovo Thinkpad,5859,,,,,,,,I bought my Lenovo IdeaPad 5 from this seller just few weeks back as well after doing the same config on Lenovo's site.,1,21306
Lenovo Thinkpad,5860,,,,,,,,nope.,1,21307
Lenovo Thinkpad,5860,,,,,,,,compare with australia,1,21308

Lenovo Thinkpad,5861,,,,,,,,I do want to caution that the RAM in this case is likely soldered.,1,21312
Lenovo Thinkpad,5861,,,,,,,,"So there may be no option to upgrade, in case you are thinking of getting more RAM.",1,21313
Lenovo Thinkpad,5862,,,,,,,,"I think because there is no sale now, Lenovo jacked up the prices of all their products significantly.",1,21314
Lenovo Thinkpad,5862,,,,,,,,"Recently went to check the E495, and the base spec is already over 1.1K SGD.",1,21315
Lenovo Thinkpad,5863,,,,,,,A,I get the point about the ThinkPad keyboard.,1,21316
Lenovo Thinkpad,5863,,,,,,,A,"At least in terms of priority, I will certainly take a better screen if I can find it elsewhere, and settle for a lesser keyboard.",1,21317
Lenovo Thinkpad,5863,,,,,,,,"I type quite a lot as well, but I can adapt.",1,21318
Lenovo Thinkpad,5863,,,,,,,,"Because I use the screen all the time when using a laptop, I think it will be my priority.",1,21319
Lenovo Thinkpad,5864,,,,,,,,Pulled the trigger and gotten it.,1,21320
Lenovo Thinkpad,5864,,,,,,,,Actually i'm more gian about the express delivery than the microsoft office,1,21321
Lenovo Thinkpad,5864,,,,,,,,Will post more update once it arrives,1,21322
Lenovo Thinkpad,5865,,,,,,,,Very tempting to get the Lenovo as well,1,21323
Lenovo Thinkpad,5865,,,,,,,,but quite surprised they still using the barrel plug,1,21324
Lenovo Thinkpad,5865,,,,,,,,saw that it can charge over the USB C as well,1,21325
Lenovo Thinkpad,5865,,,,,,,,but anyone know how many watts it'll take?,1,21326
Lenovo Thinkpad,5865,,,,,,,,I have 65W and Apple 87W charger.,1,21327
Lenovo Thinkpad,5866,,,,,,,,But is it safe to purchase from themInfinito,1,21328
Lenovo Thinkpad,5866,,,,,,,,ATRiX ?,1,21329
Lenovo Thinkpad,5866,,,,,,,,Did a google on the brand and came across several complaints about Atrix Dynamics.. do they belong to the same company such that they simply changed name ?,1,21330

Lenovo Thinkpad,5869,,,,,,,,is this lenovo occifer stock?,1,21334
Lenovo Thinkpad,5869,,,,,,,,this lcd isit good?,1,21335
Lenovo Thinkpad,5870,,,,,,,,Hi dear~confirm 100% sRGB and 3Years,1,21336
Lenovo Thinkpad,5870,,,,,,,,Lenovo onsite warranty,1,21337
Lenovo Thinkpad,5871,,,,,,,,If 100% sRGB it's quite a good buy.,1,21338
Lenovo Thinkpad,5871,,,,,,,,"Only two points worth noting:
- output possibly restricted to 4K@30HZ going by",1,21339
Lenovo Thinkpad,5871,,,,,,,,psref,1,21340

Lenovo Thinkpad,5871,,,,,,,,I have a gen 2 SSD which might be bottlenecked by this.,1,21342
Lenovo Thinkpad,5871,,,,,,,,But ok for the price,1,21343
Lenovo Thinkpad,5871,,,,,,,,"it's a really good deal, company name notwithstanding.",1,21344
Lenovo Thinkpad,5871,,,,,,,,I might wait for the T14 AMD instead.,1,21345
Lenovo Thinkpad,5871,,,,,,,,That one will have 2 usb c gen2 ports with displayport 1.4 and hdmi 2.0...,1,21346
Lenovo Thinkpad,5872,,,,,,,,"Ask the staff inside lo, if the specs are true will be quite worth",1,21347
Lenovo Thinkpad,5872,,,,,,,,Sent from Rem Is Best Waifu using GAGT,1,21348

Lenovo Thinkpad,5873,,,,,,,,"I checked the model number to the psref, it's a Singapore model.",1,21350
Lenovo Thinkpad,5873,,,,,,,,For some reason the psref was removed but Google cache still has a copy of it.,1,21351
Lenovo Thinkpad,5873,,,,,,,,Unfortunately it's impossible to check whether really 100% srgb,1,21352
Lenovo Thinkpad,5874,,,,,,,,The AU website listed HDMI 1.4 and color gamut,1,21353
Lenovo Thinkpad,5874,,,,,,,,45%i assume this is NTSC for this model.,1,21354
Lenovo Thinkpad,5874,,,,,,,,Is the lazada using a different panel?,1,21355
Lenovo Thinkpad,5875,,,,,,,,If you look at the psref website there is a version with 100% sRGB.,1,21356
Lenovo Thinkpad,5875,,,,,,,,short of using a colorimeter on the actual unit,1,21357
Lenovo Thinkpad,5875,,,,,,,,it's impossible to verify since both are full HD IPS,1,21358
Lenovo Thinkpad,5875,,,,,,,,300 nits lol.,1,21359
Lenovo Thinkpad,5875,,,,,,,,Hdmi 1.4 will mean only 4k@30hz really a pity because all Ryzen igpus support hdmi 2.0.,1,21360
Lenovo Thinkpad,5875,,,,,,,,But I'm more curious whether the limitation also applies over displayport.,1,21361
Lenovo Thinkpad,5876,,,,,,,,I saw them listed as an authorised reseller on Lenovo's FB:,1,21362
Lenovo Thinkpad,5876,,,,,,,,So... seems ok?,1,21363
Lenovo Thinkpad,5877,,,,,,,,Very interesting indeed.,1,21364
Lenovo Thinkpad,5877,,,,,,,,After looking at all the amd skus for both 15w and high powered 35-45w sku.,1,21365
Lenovo Thinkpad,5877,,,,,,,,Intel need to really buck up liao lol.,1,21366
Lenovo Thinkpad,5877,,,,,,,,Even the upcoming r5 is a hexa core.,1,21367
Lenovo Thinkpad,5877,,,,,,,,Really wonder how the i5 i7 quad cores gonna sell lol,1,21368
Lenovo Thinkpad,5878,,,,,,,,"Looking at the Intel counterpart, it has the option for 100% sRGB",1,21369
Lenovo Thinkpad,5878,,,,,,,,so it might be true?,1,21370

Lenovo Thinkpad,5879,,,,,,,,I just checked with someone who has the 15 inch model.,1,21376
Lenovo Thinkpad,5879,,,,,,,,The USB-C port supports 4k@60hz@10-bit,1,21377
Lenovo Thinkpad,5879,,,,,,,,so I assume it should be a normal DP 1.4 pass through which is good news!,1,21378
Lenovo Thinkpad,5879,,,,,,,,Hopefully the 14 inch is the same.,1,21379
Lenovo Thinkpad,5879,,,,,,,,I just ordered.,1,21380
Lenovo Thinkpad,5879,,,,,,,,Apparently there's an additional 50 off if you follow the shop.,1,21381
Lenovo Thinkpad,5879,,,,,,,,"Tbh I think atrix doesn't have the best of reputation, but let's see how it goes.",1,21382
Lenovo Thinkpad,5879,,,,,,,,I'll test to see whether 100% sRGB claim is true.,1,21383
Lenovo Thinkpad,5879,,,,,,,,Probably will sell once the T14 AMD comes out,1,21384
Lenovo Thinkpad,5879,,,,,,,,but I guess it should retain its value well?,1,21385
Lenovo Thinkpad,5880,,,,,,,,Yes but metal SKU only.,1,21386
Lenovo Thinkpad,5880,,,,,,,,The AMD SKU they are selling is the aluminium + plastic SKU,1,21387
Lenovo Thinkpad,5880,,,,,,,,but then the screen selection across different SKUs may be different.,1,21388
Lenovo Thinkpad,5881,,,,,,,,U able to use the $50 off ?,1,21389
Lenovo Thinkpad,5881,,,,,,,,the shop told me not applicable to the purchase,1,21390
Lenovo Thinkpad,5882,,,,,,,,"Didn't know about the additional 50 off,",1,21391
Lenovo Thinkpad,5882,,,,,,,,"oh well, still a good deal, please update us whether its really 100% sRGB.",1,21392
Lenovo Thinkpad,5882,,,,,,,,I also ordered one but got no device to test the screen.,1,21393
Lenovo Thinkpad,5883,,,,,,,,For my case I wasn't able to apply that $50 by following the shop.,1,21394
Lenovo Thinkpad,5883,,,,,,,,Let's wait for the laptop to be shipped out,1,21395
Lenovo Thinkpad,5884,,,,,,,,"Can leh, it applied for me automatically on checkout.",1,21396
Lenovo Thinkpad,5884,,,,,,,,Hope this laptop retains its resale value for 1 mth or so before T14 AMD is released or the Envy x360 AMD...,1,21397

Lenovo Thinkpad,5899,,,,,,,,Do ask them to reconfirm because it is not written on the specs found on the box.,1,21451
Lenovo Thinkpad,5899,,,,,,,,So they may not be 100% sure.,1,21452
Lenovo Thinkpad,5900,,,,,,,,I think it does have the fingerprint sensor as standard.,1,21453
Lenovo Thinkpad,5901,,,,,,,,"IdeaPad 5 have 2 sizes, which is normally mentioned in the name.",1,21454
Lenovo Thinkpad,5901,,,,N,,,,Not too sure what the slim means when the seller mentioned the weight being around 1.5KG.,1,21455
Lenovo Thinkpad,5901,,,,,,,,"The model that I have running an Intel processor is also IdeaPad 5, and also 1.5KG.",1,21456
Lenovo Thinkpad,5902,,,,,,,,Did you check the minimal purchase amount?,1,21457
Lenovo Thinkpad,5902,,,,,,,,I recall it was 50 off 1600.,1,21458
Lenovo Thinkpad,5902,,,,,,,,"If so, then that is the reason why it did not apply.",1,21459
Lenovo Thinkpad,5902,,,,,,,,"If you collected the Atrix couple during the weekend sale, you should have 20 bucks off.",1,21460
Lenovo Thinkpad,5903,,,,,,,A,"Because in the US they have this model called Ideapad Slim 7, so i assume there will be similar model with ""5"" in it",1,21461
Lenovo Thinkpad,5903,,,,,,,,But it looks more premium as compared to ideapad 5 AMD.,1,21462
Lenovo Thinkpad,5904,,,,,,,,I went to Google the SKU configuration 81YM005DSB it got removed from Lenovo's website from Google still has a cache:,1,21463
Lenovo Thinkpad,5904,,,,,,,,Shows here no fingerprint reader.,1,21464
Lenovo Thinkpad,5904,,,,,,,,"Btw, yours is which IdeaPad 5 model?",1,21465
Lenovo Thinkpad,5904,,,,,,,,What is the model of the BOE display?,1,21466
Lenovo Thinkpad,5905,,,,,,,,"The $50 is applicable, I have to unfollow and follow again on the Lazada app from my phone for the coupon to pop up on the screen to claim.",1,21467
Lenovo Thinkpad,5905,,,,,,,,Then when check out it will auto apply the coupon.,1,21468
Lenovo Thinkpad,5906,,,,,,,,"Actually now you talk about it, i realize mine got deducted the $50 right before i paid.",1,21469
Lenovo Thinkpad,5906,,,,,,,,"My mistake, saw wrongly",1,21470
Lenovo Thinkpad,5907,,,,,,,,The model number says IdeaPad 5 14IIL05.,1,21471
Lenovo Thinkpad,5907,,,,,,,,Model number I think is 81YH007BSB.,1,21472
Lenovo Thinkpad,5907,,,,,,,,"As for the model of the display, I only checked the device manager hardware ID, which returned the value, BOE08D7.",1,21473
Lenovo Thinkpad,5907,,,,,,,,"I tried looking up for this, but found no information on it.",1,21474
Lenovo Thinkpad,5908,,,,,,,,You can't compare the 5 and the 7 series since they are different class.,1,21475
Lenovo Thinkpad,5908,,,,,,,,"Generally, the IdeaPad should start with 3 as the lower end model and 7 being the top end model.",1,21476
Lenovo Thinkpad,5908,,,,,,,,They added another S145 which I think is lower end than the 3 series.,1,21477
Lenovo Thinkpad,5909,,,,,,,,"If you can, can you download HWINFO which should show the full model name of the display?",1,21478
Lenovo Thinkpad,5909,,,,,,,,Btw noted yours have a beefier 57wh battery as well the one atrix is selling is 45wh only.,1,21479
Lenovo Thinkpad,5909,,,,,,,,How is the battery life on the Intel model?,1,21480
Lenovo Thinkpad,5910,,,,,,,A,In Singapore its called the Yoga Slim 7.,1,21481
Lenovo Thinkpad,5910,,,,,,,,I was waiting for it to be launched actually.,1,21482
Lenovo Thinkpad,5910,,,,,,,,The Intel version was on the Lenovo store for a few weeks but mysteriously disappeared.,1,21483
Lenovo Thinkpad,5910,,,,,,,,I heard the Intel version got recalled for some issue or something.,1,21484
Lenovo Thinkpad,5910,,,,,,,,You cant find any review anywhere.,1,21485
Lenovo Thinkpad,5910,,,,,,,,Lol.,1,21486
Lenovo Thinkpad,5910,,,,N,,,,The Slim 7 is not very light too...,1,21487
Lenovo Thinkpad,5910,,,,,,,,Around 1.5kg.,1,21488
Lenovo Thinkpad,5910,,,,P,,,,I really miss the older IdeaPad 720s and s730 which were very portable and lightweight.,1,21489
Lenovo Thinkpad,5910,,,,,,,,Assuming the Ideapad 5 really has,1,21490
Lenovo Thinkpad,5910,,,,,,,,"a 100% sRGB screen the only difference would be build materials, usb 3.1 Gen2/tb3 and hdmi2.0.",1,21491
Lenovo Thinkpad,5910,,,,,,,,Honestly I more curious waiting to see how much the T14 AMD will cost.,1,21492
Lenovo Thinkpad,5910,,,,,,,,"If the t495 is any indication, should be around 2k for a high end config with 16gb and 1tb ssd.",1,21493
Lenovo Thinkpad,5910,,,,,,,,Still cheaper than dell XPS or macbook,1,21494
Lenovo Thinkpad,5911,,,,,,,,"Well if it doesn¬¨√≠t have the 100% sRGB screen like the seller mentioned, I think can return the product since they gave wrong information.",1,21495
Lenovo Thinkpad,5912,,,,,,,,"Ahhh i see, but",1,21496
Lenovo Thinkpad,5912,,,,,,,,so far hows the build quality at least for your Ideapad 5 ?,1,21497
Lenovo Thinkpad,5912,,,,,,,,"For the base which uses ABS, does it feel flimsy / warp easily with just alittle force.",1,21498
Lenovo Thinkpad,5912,,,,,,,,"First time getting Lenovo laptop, so not too sure about its build quality for their lower end models.",1,21499
Lenovo Thinkpad,5912,,,,,,,,Much appreciated !,1,21500
Lenovo Thinkpad,5912,,,,,,,,"Hahahah actually everyone is fine with this model, but the million dollar question is still about the 100% sRGB screen !",1,21501
Lenovo Thinkpad,5912,,,,,,,,The performance definitely on par / wins the dell XPS 13.,1,21502
Lenovo Thinkpad,5913,,,,,,,,Build quality is decent.,1,21503
Lenovo Thinkpad,5913,,,,,,,,In fact it is a step up from my ThinkPad E485 which is really the entry level ThinkPad model.,1,21504
Lenovo Thinkpad,5913,,,,,,,,"The base is plastic, but feels sturdy.",1,21505
Lenovo Thinkpad,5913,,P,,,,,,The keyboard feels very nice to type on.,1,21506
Lenovo Thinkpad,5913,,,,,,,,No complain on the build.,1,21507
Lenovo Thinkpad,5913,,,,,,,,"My main complain is on the Samsung SSD PM991 being used on this laptop because it is the smaller 2242 form factor used, it runs really really hot.",1,21508
Lenovo Thinkpad,5913,,,,,,,,"In games and for about 10 mins, it hit 74 degs.",1,21509
Lenovo Thinkpad,5913,,,,,,,,"When running an anti virus scan, it heats up to 81 degs and throttled to keep the SSD running at 75 to 76 degs.",1,21510
Lenovo Thinkpad,5913,,,,,,,,"In comparison, the WD Black that I was using in my E485 that I upgraded ran mostly at 60ish degs.",1,21511
Lenovo Thinkpad,5913,,,,,,,,"The SSD on the IdeaPad has got a warranty sticker on it, so I am thinking if I can change it without voiding warranty.",1,21512
Lenovo Thinkpad,5913,,,,,,,,Not sure if anyone knows?,1,21513
Lenovo Thinkpad,5913,,,,,,,,"I know for Acer, you can break the warranty seal, and as long as you don't damage anything, warranty will still be valid.",1,21514
Lenovo Thinkpad,5914,,,,,,,,I think you need to be careful here.,1,21515
Lenovo Thinkpad,5914,,,,,,,,I've ever got my return rejected by seller despite the fact that they confirmed a feature that was not found in the product.,1,21516
Lenovo Thinkpad,5914,,,,,,,,"And its a local LazMall seller, and not some unknown Chinese seller.",1,21517
Lenovo Thinkpad,5914,,,,,,,A,"The moment you opened the item, the odds of return is greatly diminished.",1,21518
Lenovo Thinkpad,5914,,,,,,,,"In this case, it can be quite difficult to ascertain if it is a 100% sRGB screen without trained eyes or proper equipments.",1,21519
Lenovo Thinkpad,5914,,,,,,,,"Lenovo multi source their display, so",1,21520
Lenovo Thinkpad,5914,,,N,,,,,"unless otherwise specified, there is always a chance you get the poorer quality screen.",1,21521
Lenovo Thinkpad,5915,,,,,,,,Maybe the Yoga bend too much that it broke.,1,21522
Lenovo Thinkpad,5915,,,,,,,,"Anyway, I suspect the cost of ThinkPad T series with AMD will not be as cheap as it was before.",1,21523
Lenovo Thinkpad,5915,,,,,,,,"Previously regardless of Ryzen 5 or 7, you get standard 4 cores.",1,21524
Lenovo Thinkpad,5915,,,,,,,,"Now with a higher core count with the higher end models, the laptop cost is likely to increase.",1,21525
Lenovo Thinkpad,5915,,,,,,,,Which is why I feel this IdeaPad 5 is pretty decently priced.,1,21526
Lenovo Thinkpad,5916,,,,,,,,I think it also depends how AMD prices it.,1,21527
Lenovo Thinkpad,5916,,,,,,,,"I see overseas pricing for Envy x360, Swift 3 and IdeaPad 5, price difference is only about 100 USD.",1,21528
Lenovo Thinkpad,5916,,,,,,,,Not sure if it's wise for me to buy this just to play around...,1,21529
Lenovo Thinkpad,5916,,,,,,,,Maybe I should cancel my order,1,21530
Lenovo Thinkpad,5916,,,,,,,,Btw whoever wants to calibrate their display...,1,21531
Lenovo Thinkpad,5916,,,,,,,,I can probably lend my calibrator to you for a nominal fee.,1,21532
Lenovo Thinkpad,5916,,,,,,,,After CB of course.,1,21533
Lenovo Thinkpad,5917,,,,,,,,not lazmall cannot return,1,21534
Lenovo Thinkpad,5918,,,,,,,,"I see, thanks for the info, fingers crossed if its really a 100% sRGB screen like they mentioned but if its not, I might just sell it after a few months of usage.",1,21535
Lenovo Thinkpad,5919,,,,,,,,"Don't rush to buy bah, wait for the thinkpad versions to come out than see.",1,21536
Lenovo Thinkpad,5920,,,,,,,,Btw someone on Carousell is doing preorder for Acer Swift 3 China sets.,1,21537
Lenovo Thinkpad,5920,,,,,,,,"4700U 16gb 1tb SSD for 1,300.",1,21538
Lenovo Thinkpad,5920,,,,,,,,Swift 3,1,21539
Lenovo Thinkpad,5920,,,,,,,,no need to guess,1,21540
Lenovo Thinkpad,5920,,,,,,,,", it's",1,21541
Lenovo Thinkpad,5920,,,,,,,,*,1,21542
Lenovo Thinkpad,5920,,,,,,,,*,1,21543
Lenovo Thinkpad,5920,,,,,,,,** display.,1,21544
Lenovo Thinkpad,5920,,,,,,,,But has usb 3 gen 2 and hdmi 2.0,1,21545
Lenovo Thinkpad,5921,,,,,,,,1.3K for China set is not worth it,1,21546
Lenovo Thinkpad,5921,,,,,,,,I feel.,1,21547
Lenovo Thinkpad,5921,,,,,,,,The display is not good even though it¬¨√≠s an IPS screen.,1,21548
Lenovo Thinkpad,5921,,,,,,,,I think Anandtech and Tomshardware have already reviewed it.,1,21549
Lenovo Thinkpad,5922,,,,,,,P,"Well... I was camping for this particular model, waiting for the flash sales price to release.. and the moment the clock strike 12 am, I am super delighted to see the price is marked down to 1298!",1,21550
Lenovo Thinkpad,5922,,,,,,,,However when I tried to collect the $50 follower voucher by following the store.,1,21551
Lenovo Thinkpad,5922,,,,,,,,there is no pop-up window to collect the $50 voucher.,1,21552
Lenovo Thinkpad,5922,,,,,,,,I even PM,1,21553
Lenovo Thinkpad,5922,,,,,,,,the shop at that point in time.,1,21554
Lenovo Thinkpad,5922,,,,,,,,only to receive a reply at 12 pm stating that this $50 dollars voucher doesn't apply to this flash sales price Which we all know is not true.,1,21555
Lenovo Thinkpad,5922,,,,,,,,"So after placing the order without using the voucher, I randomly went to try to unfollow and follow the shop and the pop-up window",1,21556
Lenovo Thinkpad,5922,,,,,,,,appear for me to collect the $50 voucher!,1,21557
Lenovo Thinkpad,5922,,,,,,,,so I cancelled the order and re-ordered with the voucher,1,21558
Lenovo Thinkpad,5922,,,,,,,,But I am praying hard  and hope that the seller doesn't do anything to my sealed laptop,1,21559
Lenovo Thinkpad,5923,,,,,,,,u missed the previous promo actually...,1,21560
Lenovo Thinkpad,5923,,,,,,,,I bought.,2,21561

Lenovo Thinkpad,5925,,,,,,,,"also, was even cheaper",1,21567
Lenovo Thinkpad,5925,,,,,,,,what model was yrs?,1,21568
Lenovo Thinkpad,5926,,,,,,,,thinkpad x395,1,21569
Lenovo Thinkpad,5927,,,,,,,P,I have the Slim 5 sitting in the Lazada cart now while I mull over whether to get it ^^,1,21570
Lenovo Thinkpad,5928,,,,,,,,i see...,1,21571
Lenovo Thinkpad,5928,,,,,,,,my was a t495,1,21572
Lenovo Thinkpad,5929,,,,,,,,"if I were you , I'd wait for ppl who bot it and see their review",1,21573
Lenovo Thinkpad,5930,,,,,,,,Just wait for the lenovo sg to come out with customize option,1,21574
Lenovo Thinkpad,5931,,,,P,,,,I wanted the light weight..,1,21575
Lenovo Thinkpad,5931,,,,,,,,If not I also will go,1,21576
Lenovo Thinkpad,5931,,,,,,,,T series lol,1,21577
Lenovo Thinkpad,5932,,,,,,,,"I mean if you need it, then I see no reason to hold back.",1,21578
Lenovo Thinkpad,5932,,,,,,,,"I actually feel for the specs, extended onsite warranty and free gifts, it¬¨√≠s a really good deal.",1,21579
Lenovo Thinkpad,5933,,,,,,,,T495 panel with 400 nits has got a high 98.6% sRGB.,1,21580
Lenovo Thinkpad,5933,,,,,,,,"Refer to the
.",1,21581
Lenovo Thinkpad,5934,,,,,,,,Yup.,1,21582
Lenovo Thinkpad,5934,,,,,,,,But few gens back,1,21583
Lenovo Thinkpad,5934,,,,,,,,the t series also had crappy screens,1,21584
Lenovo Thinkpad,5935,,,,,,,,Good to know.,1,21585
Lenovo Thinkpad,5935,,,,,,,,"Similar to my observations, I feel the IdeaPad 5 build is quite good for its price.",1,21586
Lenovo Thinkpad,5935,,,,,,,,"As to the performance of the 4700U, the ability to maintain a higher clockspeed is as expected.",1,21587
Lenovo Thinkpad,5935,,,,,,,,Good for those looking for high CPU performance.,1,21588
Lenovo Thinkpad,5936,,,,,,,,"Hi all, I made the purchase!",1,21589
Lenovo Thinkpad,5936,,,,,,,,Excited as the Lenovo laptop will be my first laptop,1,21590
Lenovo Thinkpad,5937,,,,,,,,Have fun man.,1,21591
Lenovo Thinkpad,5937,,,,,,,,"If I did not buy my laptop 2 weeks back, I would have gotten this.",1,21592
Lenovo Thinkpad,5937,,,,,,,,Got tired waiting for Renoir based laptops.,1,21593
Lenovo Thinkpad,5937,,,,,,,,May consider getting a desktop Renoir instead for my HTPC if the pricing is attractive.,1,21594
Lenovo Thinkpad,5938,N,,,,,,,Haha just came to the realisation that my Renoir laotop may potentially be faster than my desktop???,1,21595
Lenovo Thinkpad,5938,,,,,,,,Bought i5-6600k,1,21596
Lenovo Thinkpad,5938,,,,,,,,"a few years back, just before AMD struck back",1,21597
Lenovo Thinkpad,5939,,,,,,,,It just goes to show how much improvements AMD brought to the PC space.,1,21598
Lenovo Thinkpad,5939,,,,,,,,"While Intel was happily selling us expensive 2 and 4 core chips for more than a decade, AMD came in about 3 years back and PC became exciting again.",1,21599
Lenovo Thinkpad,5939,,,,,,,A,Even hardcore Intel fans should thank AMD for more affordable and powerful Intel chips.,1,21600
Lenovo Thinkpad,5939,,,,,,,,Competition is good.,1,21601
Lenovo Thinkpad,5940,,,,,,,,"No leh, I hate AMD, now need to upgrade more often",1,21602
Lenovo Thinkpad,5940,,,,,,,,Thought my desktop can last 8 years last time hahahahahah,1,21603
Lenovo Thinkpad,5941,,,,,,,,By the way anyone orders shipped out alr?,1,21604
Lenovo Thinkpad,5941,,,,,,,,Mine still packing stage...,1,21605
Lenovo Thinkpad,5942,,,,,,,,time to upgrade desktop also.......,1,21606
Lenovo Thinkpad,5943,,,,,,,,"Ya same still packing... chatted with them, they said will start to ship today and expect 3-5 days to receive",1,21607
Lenovo Thinkpad,5943,,,,,,,,.. thought their listing said 1-2 days,1,21608
Lenovo Thinkpad,5944,,,,,,,,You still have the choice not to upgrade man.,1,21609
Lenovo Thinkpad,5945,,,,,,,,"Eh, I thought it said same day delivery",1,21610
Lenovo Thinkpad,5945,,,,,,,,or did I remember wrongly?,1,21611
Lenovo Thinkpad,5945,,,,,,,,"For this model, I know they also have a caveat that buyer could receive on 18th May or something like that.",1,21612
Lenovo Thinkpad,5946,,,,,,,,"No same day delivery, only 'express delivery' within 1 - 2 days and latest and receive by 14 May.",1,21613
Lenovo Thinkpad,5947,,,,,,,,Yeah,1,21614
Lenovo Thinkpad,5947,,,,,,,,but I think that faq was posted when the listing appeared last week,1,21615
Lenovo Thinkpad,5947,,,,,,,,lol,1,21616
Lenovo Thinkpad,5948,,,,,,,,My status has changed to 'Your package has been packed and is ready to be shipped to you'.,1,21617
Lenovo Thinkpad,5948,,,,,,,,So we'll see.,1,21618
Lenovo Thinkpad,5949,,,,,,,,Means you need to wait for NinjaVan to pick up and deliver.,1,21619
Lenovo Thinkpad,5950,,,,,,,,Best case scenario,1,21620
Lenovo Thinkpad,5950,,,,,,,,"it comes either tomorrow or Friday, won't be surprise if it comes on Saturday.",1,21621
Lenovo Thinkpad,5951,,,,,,,,"that's why for the past 10 years, there was no such thing as ""CPU bottleneck"" coz intel never improved.",1,21622
Lenovo Thinkpad,5951,,,,,,,,now AMD came and intel needs to wake up or die... and they are rushing 10nm coz,1,21623
Lenovo Thinkpad,5951,N,,,,,,,they were too slow on 14nm.,1,21624
Lenovo Thinkpad,5951,,,,,,,,"also, I don't need to keep changing motherboards when I  change processor for AMD.",1,21625
Lenovo Thinkpad,5951,,,,,,,,I need to for intel,1,21626
Lenovo Thinkpad,5952,,,,,,,,Ordered 3 weeks back..,1,21627
Lenovo Thinkpad,5952,,,,,,,,Still have not shipped...,1,21628
Lenovo Thinkpad,5952,,,,,,,,Sigh...,1,21629
Lenovo Thinkpad,5953,,,,P,,,,"okay la, T series not bad quite lightweight also",1,21630
Lenovo Thinkpad,5954,,,,,,,P,great.,1,21631
Lenovo Thinkpad,5954,,,,,,,,waiting for thinkpad!,1,21632
Lenovo Thinkpad,5954,,,,,,,,can't come sooner!,1,21633
Lenovo Thinkpad,5955,,,,,,,,Okay just checked with the seller...,1,21634
Lenovo Thinkpad,5955,,,,,,,,ETA tomorrow,1,21635
Lenovo Thinkpad,5956,,,,,,,,Asked the CSO of lenovo.,1,21636
Lenovo Thinkpad,5956,,,,,,,,Tentatively is 2nd week of June for the new T series,1,21637
Lenovo Thinkpad,5956,,,,,,,,so i guess inline with the launch in NA?,1,21638
Lenovo Thinkpad,5957,,,,,,,P,That's great!,1,21639
Lenovo Thinkpad,5957,,,,,,,,But then need to wait another month for it to reach sg after ordering?,1,21640
Lenovo Thinkpad,5958,,,,,,,,"My guess is they already building up inventory, so the time after ordering should not be too long, hard to say with the covid19 now",1,21641
Lenovo Thinkpad,5958,,,,,,,,though,1,21642
Lenovo Thinkpad,5958,,,,,,,,i see some of the drivers got support for the new thinkpads since April,1,21643
Lenovo Thinkpad,5959,,,,,,,,I think it is possible if demand is high.,1,21644
Lenovo Thinkpad,5959,,,,,,,,"As per my questio to Atrix computer about the 15 inch IdeaPad 5, they responded to say due to shortage of Renoir chips, 15 inch model will only be out in July.",1,21645
Lenovo Thinkpad,5959,,,,,,,,"If that is true, and based on observations on the availability of Renoir laptops 1.5 months after AMD officially announced and released in March, I think there is indeed a shortage.",1,21646
Lenovo Thinkpad,5959,,,,,,,,I think to some extend the supply disruption will also affect the PC makers in releasing new laptops as well.,1,21647
Lenovo Thinkpad,5960,,,,,,,,"I just receive a GrabExpress delivery notification coming from a shop in Sim Lim Square, it seems like my laptop is coming soon?",1,21648
Lenovo Thinkpad,5960,,,,,,,,Will update.,1,21649

Lenovo Thinkpad,5965,,,,,,,,"Just receive an image on GrabExpress of my item, seems like they just put it in a plastic bag without even wrapping it :",1,21657

Lenovo Thinkpad,5966,,,,,,,,Driver is 4 mins away,1,21660
Lenovo Thinkpad,5966,,,,,,,,wow.,1,21661
Lenovo Thinkpad,5966,,,,,,,,Hopefully can play with it tonight and test sRGB,1,21662
Lenovo Thinkpad,5967,,,,,,,,"Looking forward to your test, according to the picture i receive, the sticker specs on the box doesn't say anything about 100% sRGB, so I'm still a skeptic on this.",1,21663
Lenovo Thinkpad,5967,,,,,,,,"My ETA has changed to 35 mins,",1,21664
Lenovo Thinkpad,5967,,,,,,,,oh wells..,1,21665
Lenovo Thinkpad,5968,,,,,,,,Seems like they changed the delivery partner to Grab.,1,21666
Lenovo Thinkpad,5968,,,,,,,,Good.,1,21667
Lenovo Thinkpad,5968,,,,,,,,NinjaVan offers same days delivery too.,1,21668

Lenovo Thinkpad,5969,,,,,,,,the delivery uncle told me the seller paid delivery fee - $18 + $4 parking fee..,1,21671
Lenovo Thinkpad,5970,,,,,,,,Huh?,1,21672
Lenovo Thinkpad,5970,,,,,,,,Need pay the delivery fee meh?,1,21673
Lenovo Thinkpad,5971,,,,,,,,Huh why do you need to pay ?,1,21674
Lenovo Thinkpad,5971,,,,,,,,Mine was via GrabExpress,1,21675
Lenovo Thinkpad,5971,,,,,,,,never request me to pay,1,21676
Lenovo Thinkpad,5972,,,,,,,,"Paiseh, I mean the seller paid $22 just for sending the stuff to us!",1,21677
Lenovo Thinkpad,5973,,,,,,,,"Enjoy guys, mine still far out, think i'll receive by 8PM?",1,21678
Lenovo Thinkpad,5974,,,,,,,,review review,1,21679
Lenovo Thinkpad,5975,,,,,,,,Don't know where am i really getting my lappy.,1,21680

Lenovo Thinkpad,5981,,,,,,,,Most probably not 100% sRGB,1,21691
Lenovo Thinkpad,5981,,,,,,,,but will do a test just to be sure.,1,21692
Lenovo Thinkpad,5982,,,,,,,,I didn¬¨√≠t.,1,21693
Lenovo Thinkpad,5982,,,,,,,,Don¬¨√≠t think there will be either,1,21694
Lenovo Thinkpad,5983,,,,,,,,"Other first impressions - adapter doesn't have ground pin so if you touch the aluminium lid you can feel ""current"" running through.",1,21695
Lenovo Thinkpad,5983,,,,,,,,No fingerprint reader.,1,21696
Lenovo Thinkpad,5983,,,,,,,,"The plastic base has the rough coating, think similar to the E485",1,21697

Lenovo Thinkpad,5984,,,,,,,,No issues.,1,21701
Lenovo Thinkpad,5984,,,,,,,,Quite dissapointed ours doesn't have the fingerprint sensor.,1,21702
Lenovo Thinkpad,5984,,,,,,,,Display does look abit dull to my eyes.,1,21703
Lenovo Thinkpad,5985,,,,,,,,"Display wise with just naked eyes, already don't seems to be 100% sRGB",1,21704
Lenovo Thinkpad,5985,,,,,,,,and it's Abit washout.,1,21705
Lenovo Thinkpad,5985,,,,,,,,But definitely better than some laptop I own before.,1,21706
Lenovo Thinkpad,5985,,,,,,,,"I recommend anyone who owns this laptop, just grab a uGreen USB C charger",1,21707
Lenovo Thinkpad,5985,,,,,,,,65W. Cost around 20+ and easily available on Lazada !,1,21708
Lenovo Thinkpad,5985,,,,,,,,"Build quality better than expected, of course if you compare with high end laptops the difference is skyhigh.",1,21709
Lenovo Thinkpad,5985,,,,,,,,But the performance is able to compensate the cons Ô£ø√º√≤√ÖÔ£ø√º√≤√Ö,1,21710
Lenovo Thinkpad,5986,,,,,,,,By the way I have just checked the warranty online..,1,21711
Lenovo Thinkpad,5986,,,,,,,,it stated 2 years warranty instead of,1,21712
Lenovo Thinkpad,5986,,,,,,,,3.. seller told me present invoice will do Ô£ø√º√≤√ñ,1,21713

Lenovo Thinkpad,5987,,,,,,,,"57.9% sRGB, 40.1% Adobe RGB and 41.2% DCI-P3.",2,21714
Lenovo Thinkpad,5987,,,,,,,,Quite a stark difference since I'm used to 100% sRGB screens,1,21715
Lenovo Thinkpad,5987,,,,,,,,; my main monitor has 95% DCI-P3 lol.,1,21716
Lenovo Thinkpad,5987,,,,,,,,The anti-glare coating on the screen also seems a bit extreme,1,21717
Lenovo Thinkpad,5987,,,,,,,,Not sure if I should do a refund.,1,21718
Lenovo Thinkpad,5987,,,,,,,,Currently I am awaiting refund of my XPS 13.,1,21719
Lenovo Thinkpad,5987,,,,,,,,"If approved, then it means I might be without laptop for the next two months before T14 AMD is released lol.",1,21720

Lenovo Thinkpad,5989,,,,,,,,compare the 3 devices man.,1,21726
Lenovo Thinkpad,5989,,,,,,,,One cost significantly more than the other.,1,21727
Lenovo Thinkpad,5990,,,,,,,,Just take a picture or scan the receipt and store it somewhere.,1,21728
Lenovo Thinkpad,5990,,,,,,,,I normally save them on my cloud drive after naming it in a way you can easily identify.,1,21729

Lenovo Thinkpad,5991,,,,,,,,"I agree the screen although not 100% sRGB, its better then my previous E490 and other laptops beside my Macbook Pro but its decent enough for me, think I can live with it.",1,21731

Lenovo Thinkpad,5994,,,,,,,,got test the ssd speed?,1,21744
Lenovo Thinkpad,5995,,,,,,,,I think those who really want the 100% sRGB screens need to look for the Intel counterpart or wait for the ThinkPad series.,1,21745
Lenovo Thinkpad,5995,,,,,,,,"Overall happy with the purchase, luckily paid only 1298 instead of the now 1498.",1,21746

Lenovo Thinkpad,6000,,,,,,,,they claimed Lenovo gave them the wrong specs.,1,21773
Lenovo Thinkpad,6000,,,,,,,,A bit undecided.,1,21774
Lenovo Thinkpad,6000,,,,,,,,Maybe I need to play around more with the laptop first,1,21775
Lenovo Thinkpad,6000,,,,,,,,haha.,1,21776
Lenovo Thinkpad,6000,,,,,,,,"But I must say, given their ""reputation"" in the past I am pleasantly surprised at their good aftersales support.",1,21777

Lenovo Thinkpad,6002,,,,,,,,I tot really 100% sRGB.,1,21780
Lenovo Thinkpad,6002,,,,,,,,Almost pull the trigger.,1,21781
Lenovo Thinkpad,6002,,,,,,,,I think i will just wait for the asus zephyrus 14/15 to be readily available then buy.,1,21782
Lenovo Thinkpad,6002,,,,,,,,Or perhaps if i choose not to game then i will wait for thinkpad to arrive.,1,21783
Lenovo Thinkpad,6003,,,,,,,,can test when the throttling will kick in?,1,21784
Lenovo Thinkpad,6003,,,,,,,,i.e you zoom,1,21785

Lenovo Thinkpad,6004,,,N,,,,,"On the bright side, my recent laptops with 100%+ sRGB had issues with colour tints, dead pixels, backlight bleeding, etc.",1,21787

Lenovo Thinkpad,6004,,,,,,,,"Installed BatteryBar and discharge rate is only 5,221mW while writing this post.",1,21789

Lenovo Thinkpad,6006,,,,,,,,Have to see the ear piece build in feature whether it supports anot.,1,21806
Lenovo Thinkpad,6006,,,,,,,,Some earpiece supports iOS only or Android Only or Multiple devices.,1,21807
Lenovo Thinkpad,6006,,,,,,,,So you can check your earpiece whether it supports PC .,1,21808
Lenovo Thinkpad,6007,,,,,,,,thanks for the information!,1,21809
Lenovo Thinkpad,6007,,,,,,,,looks like have to wait for the thinkpads to get a good screen,1,21810
Lenovo Thinkpad,6008,,,,,,,,The earpiece works with my XPS though.,1,21811
Lenovo Thinkpad,6008,,,,,,,,Wondering if it's a proprietary feature.,1,21812
Lenovo Thinkpad,6008,,,,,,,,Maybe Lenovo doesn't support it,1,21813
Lenovo Thinkpad,6009,,,,,,,A,"These are fairly light load, so I am not expecting it to throttle since it may not even be running at an all core boost.",1,21814

Lenovo Thinkpad,6012,,,,,,,,if you download HWINFO you should be able to see a more detailed model number.,1,21819
Lenovo Thinkpad,6012,,,,,,,,From there can look at the specs.,1,21820
Lenovo Thinkpad,6012,,,,,,,,Oh which part said it's 100% sRGB?,1,21821
Lenovo Thinkpad,6012,,,,,,,,that's interesting to know,1,21822
Lenovo Thinkpad,6013,,,,,,,,I talked to the CS about returning the item and getting the Intel version instead as in the Intel Ideadpad 5 listing they clearly put it 100% sRGB monitor but the CS replied saying their Intel version not using the 100% sRGB screen.,1,21823
Lenovo Thinkpad,6013,,,,,,,,So whack,1,21824
Lenovo Thinkpad,6014,,,,,,,,Just ran some benchmarks.,1,21825
Lenovo Thinkpad,6014,,,,,,,,Performance is good.,1,21826

Lenovo Thinkpad,6014,,,,,,,,min after 5 runs.,1,21828

Lenovo Thinkpad,6015,,,,,,,,Which listing you saw ah?,1,21832
Lenovo Thinkpad,6016,,,,,,,,I checked yesterday on HWInfo.,1,21833
Lenovo Thinkpad,6016,,,,,,,,It only mentioned unknown monitor with the model BOE08D7.,1,21834
Lenovo Thinkpad,6016,,,,,,,,sRGB is mentioned on the Atrix Lazada¬¨√≠s page.,1,21835
Lenovo Thinkpad,6017,,,,,,,,"If you still keep the box, does it show 100% sRGB at the spec at the side?",1,21836

Lenovo Thinkpad,6017,,,,,,,,"there should be two ""Monitor name"" fields.",1,21838
Lenovo Thinkpad,6017,,,,,,,,There is nothing shown on the second field?,1,21839
Lenovo Thinkpad,6017,,,,,,,,Usually there should be another model number shown there one.,1,21840
Lenovo Thinkpad,6017,,,,,,,,Can you screenshot?,1,21841
Lenovo Thinkpad,6017,,,,,,,,"Also, which model did you get?",1,21842
Lenovo Thinkpad,6017,,,,,,,,I5-1035g1 with 1tb?,1,21843
Lenovo Thinkpad,6017,,,,,,,,Do you feel the colours on the laptop is vibrant?,1,21844
Lenovo Thinkpad,6017,,,,,,,,Or muted?,1,21845
Lenovo Thinkpad,6018,,,,,,,,Are you returning yours?,1,21846
Lenovo Thinkpad,6019,,,,,,,,We cannot expect 100% sRGB with such prices.,1,21847
Lenovo Thinkpad,6019,,,,,,,,They should have done a higher price version with better display.,1,21848
Lenovo Thinkpad,6020,,,,,,,A,"When you expand the monitor settings, do you see something like this highlighted on the right?",1,21849
Lenovo Thinkpad,6020,,,,,,,,E.g. mine also shows Unknown monitor,1,21850
Lenovo Thinkpad,6020,,,,,,,,AUO408D,1,21851
Lenovo Thinkpad,6020,,,,,,,,but when you expand you can see the model is actually,1,21852
Lenovo Thinkpad,6020,,,,,,,,B140HAN04.E,1,21853
Lenovo Thinkpad,6020,,,,,,,,If it turns out to be,1,21854
Lenovo Thinkpad,6020,,,,,,,,100% sRGB,1,21855
Lenovo Thinkpad,6020,,,,,,,,I think I'm gonna return it and change it for the Intel version...,1,21856
Lenovo Thinkpad,6020,,,,,,,,haha.,1,21857
Lenovo Thinkpad,6021,,,,,,,,"This is the model,
BOE CQ NV140FHM-N4V",1,21858
Lenovo Thinkpad,6021,,,,,,,,"I can't find information specific to this ending with N4V. Some of the 14 inch monitors ending with N4 are 250, and some 300 nits.",1,21859
Lenovo Thinkpad,6021,,,,,,,,Nothing mentioned about the colors though.,1,21860
Lenovo Thinkpad,6021,,,,,,,,It does say that it is an 8bit panel.,1,21861
Lenovo Thinkpad,6021,,,,,,,,The model I got is what you mentioned but with the 512GB storage option.,1,21862
Lenovo Thinkpad,6021,,,,,,,,Color wise,1,21863
Lenovo Thinkpad,6021,,,,,,,,", I think it is better than the IPS on my E485.",1,21864
Lenovo Thinkpad,6022,,,,,,,,Nothing mentioned on monitor quality on the label.,1,21865
Lenovo Thinkpad,6022,,,,,,,,It only says 14 FHD IPS.,1,21866
Lenovo Thinkpad,6023,,,,,,,,The IdeaPad 5 with Intel processor comes with a 100% sRGB monitor as per the spec sheet that Atrix provided.,1,21867
Lenovo Thinkpad,6023,,,,,,,,I have no way to validate it though.,1,21868
Lenovo Thinkpad,6023,,,,,,,,It cost the same as the IdeaPad 5 that comes with the Renoir chip.,1,21869
Lenovo Thinkpad,6023,,,,,,,,"I actually don't think it is impossible, rather they purposely gimp the AMD version as usual.",1,21870
Lenovo Thinkpad,6024,,,,,,,,"I managed to dig out this website in Korean:
If you translate it and see the comments, he is using the BOE CQ NV140FHM-N4V as well.",1,21871
Lenovo Thinkpad,6024,,,N,,,,,"65% sRGB -- so slightly better than the 58% we have here, but far from 100% sRGB.",1,21872
Lenovo Thinkpad,6025,,,,,,,,So I think it is a Lenovo issue since this is quite off specs.,1,21873
Lenovo Thinkpad,6025,,,,,,,,Not sure if any calibration can make this better though.,1,21874
Lenovo Thinkpad,6025,,,,,,,,I am sure these panels are not calibrated.,1,21875
Lenovo Thinkpad,6026,,,,,,,,"Anyway, I think previous Lenovo laptop seem to also use BOE panel.",1,21876
Lenovo Thinkpad,6027,,,,,,,,"Nah, I'll be keeping mine, so far everything is good albeit the screen",1,21877
Lenovo Thinkpad,6027,,,,,,,,but I can live with it since I've seen worse.,1,21878
Lenovo Thinkpad,6028,,,,,,,,Probably their marketing team dunno the specs and anyhow.,1,21879
Lenovo Thinkpad,6028,,,,,,,,"After all, both are IPS 300 nits panels.",1,21880
Lenovo Thinkpad,6028,,,,,,,,I can't seem to make the reds redder on my unit.,1,21881
Lenovo Thinkpad,6028,,,,,,,,"On the bright side literally, the display is actually quite bright measured 360 nits so at full brightness it looks quite ok still.",1,21882
Lenovo Thinkpad,6029,,,,,,,,You tried upping the saturation abit in the AMD software?,1,21883
Lenovo Thinkpad,6029,,,,,,,,Not the perfect solution but abit better.,1,21884
Lenovo Thinkpad,6029,,,,,,,,"Those that have colorimeter, tried calibrating the display?",1,21885
Lenovo Thinkpad,6030,,,,,,,,Calibration won't help much on small gamut displays and may make things worst actually.,1,21886
Lenovo Thinkpad,6030,,,,,,,,Actually I'm not sure the issue is due to contrast or colour gamut?,1,21887
Lenovo Thinkpad,6030,,,,,,,,Anyway I will keep the laptop ba since the Intel version is also not 100% srgb,1,21888
Lenovo Thinkpad,6031,,,,,,,,"Actually after all these measurements to show that these are not sRGB, I am starting to doubt if the supposed 100% sRGB monitor options on Lenovo's site are accurate.",1,21889
Lenovo Thinkpad,6031,,,,,,,,Most people won't measure the display since these requires some special equipments.,1,21890
Lenovo Thinkpad,6032,,,,,,,,Waiting for next month see how's the price for t n e series first.,2,21891
Lenovo Thinkpad,6032,,,,,,,,Sent from Rem Best Grill using GAGT,2,21891
Lenovo Thinkpad,6033,,,,,,,,Should be accurate if it is specifically stated as such and no other similar config.,1,21892
Lenovo Thinkpad,6033,,,,,,,A,Example is the Yoga Slim 7 which only has 100% sRGB options.,1,21893
Lenovo Thinkpad,6033,,,,,,,,Here it is silent but someone,1,21894
Lenovo Thinkpad,6033,,,,,,,,dunno is it,1,21895
Lenovo Thinkpad,6033,,,,,,,,Lenovo or the retailer went to act smart and assume it's the full sRGB one.,1,21896
Lenovo Thinkpad,6034,,,,,,,,"Actually after i adjust abit of the saturation via the AMD radeon settings, the color seems to be richer and same as my current monitor.",1,21897
Lenovo Thinkpad,6034,,,,,,,,"I know its a cheat way, but at least visually it looks nice",1,21898
Lenovo Thinkpad,6035,,,,,,,,I think will be good to have someone to test it out.,1,21899
Lenovo Thinkpad,6035,,,,,,,,Lol.,1,21900
Lenovo Thinkpad,6035,,,,,,,,I have very little confidence with them now.,1,21901
Lenovo Thinkpad,6036,,,,,,,,So far their 7 and 9 series all use higher end screens ba.,1,21902
Lenovo Thinkpad,6036,,,,,,,,Should be ok lol.,1,21903
Lenovo Thinkpad,6037,,,,,,,,Btw anyone managed to activate the free office?,1,21904
Lenovo Thinkpad,6038,,,,,,,,"If I am not mistaken, there should be a Lenovo seal on the screw holding the SSD down.",1,21905
Lenovo Thinkpad,6038,,,,,,,,"Till now, I am not certain if it is fine to remove it without voiding warranty.",1,21906
Lenovo Thinkpad,6038,,,,,,,,"It is meant to prevent tampering, but question is if this is to prevent end users like us or the sellers from tampering.",1,21907
Lenovo Thinkpad,6039,,,,,,,,Is it?,1,21908
Lenovo Thinkpad,6039,,,,,,,,"Last when I upgraded my E490, there was no such seal.",1,21909
Lenovo Thinkpad,6039,,,,,,,,I can't open the back yet as I don't have the right screws for it.,1,21910
Lenovo Thinkpad,6040,,,,,,,,these days opening rear panel is quite normal and common..,1,21911

Lenovo Thinkpad,6041,,,,,,,,"But i didnt expect to have another slot, so gonna slot it another stick of 1TB",1,21913
Lenovo Thinkpad,6042,,,,,,,,Eh where you see the other slot?,1,21914
Lenovo Thinkpad,6043,,,,,,,,Awesome find!,1,21915
Lenovo Thinkpad,6043,,,,,,,,Will save me the hassle when moving OS.,1,21916

Lenovo Thinkpad,6131,,,,,,,,It is true if you are looking at just the hardware.,1,22159
Lenovo Thinkpad,6131,,,,,,,A,"But then again, nowadays people want a slim and light laptop.",1,22160
Lenovo Thinkpad,6131,,,,,,,,So this may not suit everyone.,1,22161
Lenovo Thinkpad,6132,,,,,,,,"Unfortunately, the highest end card you can configure with this is the GTX 1650Ti.",1,22162
Lenovo Thinkpad,6132,,,,,,,A,I do agree I won't mind having a greater than 2kg laptop.,1,22163
Lenovo Thinkpad,6132,,,,,,,,"I don't bring it out often, so weight is no issue for me.",1,22164
Lenovo Thinkpad,6133,,,,,,,,The Legion 5's exact weight is 2.26kg.,1,22165
Lenovo Thinkpad,6133,,,,P,,,,It is slightly lighter than the Thinkpad T60 I used years ago.,1,22166
Lenovo Thinkpad,6134,,,,,,,,cant imagine you need to travel with that weight during pre wuhan virus period,1,22167
Lenovo Thinkpad,6135,,,,,,,P,I think the Legion 5 would be a great lappy for photo editors.,1,22168
Lenovo Thinkpad,6135,,,,,,,,Yes it may comes with a crappy gtx1650 or TI.,1,22169
Lenovo Thinkpad,6135,,,,,,,,But nevertheless photo editors dont really need one.,1,22170
Lenovo Thinkpad,6135,,,,,,,,I really thinking to buy.,1,22171
Lenovo Thinkpad,6135,,,,,,,,But i would love to have at least a gtx1660Ti or rtx2060 for me to game by night lol.,1,22172
Lenovo Thinkpad,6136,,,,,,,,It should have up to rtx though.,1,22173
Lenovo Thinkpad,6136,,,,,,,,Maybe can wait as more variant of the model roll out.,1,22174
Lenovo Thinkpad,6137,,,,,,,,2.5kg is really for.,2,22175
Lenovo Thinkpad,6137,,,,,,,,a shoulder to cry on,2,22175
Lenovo Thinkpad,6137,,,,,,,,"i thinking to change to 16"" mbp to replace my old desktop also to relieve some space on my table.",1,22176

Lenovo Thinkpad,6137,,,,,,,,if needed,2,22177
Lenovo Thinkpad,6137,,,,,,,,i will just lug my x1c out,1,22178
Lenovo Thinkpad,6138,,,,,,,,But you need to account for the noise of the fans.,1,22179

Lenovo Thinkpad,6142,,,,,,,,Lol i think they got space to put a few more heatpipes,1,22187
Lenovo Thinkpad,6142,,,,,,,,ba,1,22188
Lenovo Thinkpad,6143,,,,,,,,Initial marketing material shown that it has up to RTX2060:,1,22189
Lenovo Thinkpad,6143,,,,,,,,But now their product database stated GPU max out at 1650Ti:,2,22190
Lenovo Thinkpad,6143,,,,,,,,"Have to wait and see whether will it be equipped with rtx2060 in the future, read from other source that it's varied by region.",2,22190

Lenovo Thinkpad,6146,,,,,,,,They still indicate it at the feature / spec page,1,22194
Lenovo Thinkpad,6147,,,,,,,,I believe what they offer may differ between countries/ regions as you rightfully pointed out.,1,22195
Lenovo Thinkpad,6148,,,,,,,,Same laptop model that they reviewed?,1,22196
Lenovo Thinkpad,6148,N,,,,,,,"I feel the 1650 runs hot if the cooling is poor, i.e. slim laptops.",1,22197
Lenovo Thinkpad,6148,,,,,,,,"I don't know how good is the cooling solution on the Legion 5, but should be good enough to dissipate the heat from a GTX 1650 reasonably well for its size.",1,22198
Lenovo Thinkpad,6149,,,,,,,,"Based on HK/UK lenovo site, GTX1660Ti and RTX2060 equipped Legion 5 will be available in 2nd half of the year, varied by regions:",1,22199

Lenovo Thinkpad,6154,,,,,,,,the deskmini  akan datang might be better,1,22221
Lenovo Thinkpad,6155,,,,,,,,I like the form factor of the Deskmini.,1,22222
Lenovo Thinkpad,6155,,,,,,,,In fact I was planning to get one with a 3200G to go along as a HTPC.,1,22223
Lenovo Thinkpad,6155,,,,,,,,"But after much consideration, I decided to just go for an ITX rig instead because I find the chipset and the number of USB ports very limiting.",1,22224
Lenovo Thinkpad,6155,,,,,,,A,"Moreover back then, the fastest DDR4 Sodimm runs at 2933 Mhz and cost a lot more than a pair of desktop DDR4 3200.",1,22225

Lenovo Thinkpad,6157,,,,,,,,just search the model you want,1,22232
Lenovo Thinkpad,6158,,,,,,,,i have 3 usb hubs attached to my deskmini.,1,22233
Lenovo Thinkpad,6158,,,,,,,,So from 3 ports > 11 usb ports.,1,22234
Lenovo Thinkpad,6158,,,,,,,,no issues so far,1,22235
Lenovo Thinkpad,6159,,,,,,,,That is one way.,1,22236
Lenovo Thinkpad,6159,,,,,,,,"I have USB hubs, but would prefer for minimal cables since its on my TV console.",1,22237
Lenovo Thinkpad,6160,N,,,,,,,Sodimm is usually more expensive and slower than desktop rams.,1,22238
Lenovo Thinkpad,6160,,,,,,,,Other limitation with the Deskmini is that its OC locked.,1,22239
Lenovo Thinkpad,6160,,,,,,,,I was planning to OC it somewhat to squeeze more performance from the GPU in particular.,1,22240
Lenovo Thinkpad,6161,,,,,,,,Got such thing as 1.5kg 4600H?,1,22241
Lenovo Thinkpad,6162,,,,,,,,Sad dont' know my laptop will arrive today not.,1,22242

Lenovo Thinkpad,6166,,,,,,,,mine also..,1,22256
Lenovo Thinkpad,6166,,,,,,,,I think its coz of the plane.,1,22257
Lenovo Thinkpad,6166,,,,,,,,doesn't fly direct to sg from hk.,1,22258
Lenovo Thinkpad,6166,,,,,,,,"so they go tw to pick up, then Shenzhen before coming to sg",1,22259
Lenovo Thinkpad,6167,,,,,,,,Looking real good..,1,22260
Lenovo Thinkpad,6167,,,,,,,,hope we got local versions.,1,22261
Lenovo Thinkpad,6168,,,,,,,,"Now UPS update as still in Shenzhen, delivery rescheduled.",1,22262
Lenovo Thinkpad,6168,,,,,,,,What a bummer.,1,22263
Lenovo Thinkpad,6169,,,,,,,,There is no chance of you getting it today if the item is still in Shenzhen.,1,22264
Lenovo Thinkpad,6169,,,,,,,,"Besides flying item over takes time, it needs to clear customs, go to the sorting hub before it gets dispatched.",1,22265
Lenovo Thinkpad,6169,,,,,,,,"So all in all, it could take an extra day or 2.",1,22266
Lenovo Thinkpad,6170,,,,,,,,waiting for ryzen 4000 series thinkpad laptop,1,22267
Lenovo Thinkpad,6171,,,,,,,,Ups show,1,22268
Lenovo Thinkpad,6171,,,,,,,,Mine is hefei to shanghai now..,1,22269
Lenovo Thinkpad,6172,,,,,,,,If shanghai only then still long way.,1,22270
Lenovo Thinkpad,6172,,,,,,,,Mine went to HK and KR then come down to SG.,1,22271
Lenovo Thinkpad,6172,,,,,,,,That also delay in SG.,1,22272
Lenovo Thinkpad,6172,,,,,,,,I ordered my E595 when CB started.,1,22273
Lenovo Thinkpad,6172,,,,,,,,Only to receive it last 3 weeks back.,1,22274
Lenovo Thinkpad,6172,,,,,,,,Overall will take between 3 wks to 4 wks to ship.,1,22275
Lenovo Thinkpad,6173,,,,,,,,"It was already shipped, not in production stage.",1,22276
Lenovo Thinkpad,6174,,,,,,,,The strange travel pattern could likely be attributed to the fact that there are a lot of travel restrictions.,1,22277
Lenovo Thinkpad,6174,,,,,,,A,"So perhaps from HK, there is no direct flight because have not lifted ban to travel to SG.",1,22278
Lenovo Thinkpad,6174,,,,,,,,So a lot of walkaround to get the product on our shores resulting in delays.,1,22279
Lenovo Thinkpad,6175,,,,,,,,Yes.,1,22280
Lenovo Thinkpad,6175,,,,,,,,Go one big round then reach you.,1,22281
Lenovo Thinkpad,6175,,,,,,,,Their tracking now also very hard to believe.,1,22282
Lenovo Thinkpad,6176,,,,,,,,Just got the expected date for my Flex 14 to arrive..,1,22283
Lenovo Thinkpad,6176,,,,,,,,It's almost a 1.5 month wait for them to ship the product.,1,22284
Lenovo Thinkpad,6176,,,,,,,,It's REALLY long,1,22285
Lenovo Thinkpad,6176,,,,,,,,and I might be thinking of a cancellation.,1,22286
Lenovo Thinkpad,6176,,,,,,,,Just a heads-up for the rest of you yea,1,22287
Lenovo Thinkpad,6177,,,,,,,,Hope it's only due to Covid-19.,1,22288
Lenovo Thinkpad,6177,,,,,,,,Lenovo should not sell laptops if they are unable to fulfill delivery deadline.,1,22289
Lenovo Thinkpad,6177,,,,,,,,My last ThinkPad also got delayed and they promised to compensate a cheap HDD which they didn't even keep to it.,1,22290
Lenovo Thinkpad,6178,,,,,,,,I think there are multiple hurdles for them to fulfill orders quickly.,1,22291
Lenovo Thinkpad,6178,,,,,,,,1,1,22292
Lenovo Thinkpad,6178,,,,,,,,"Low supply of components, and I believe supply for Renoir is still very limited.",2,22293

Lenovo Thinkpad,6178,,,,,,,,Travel restrictions affects point 2,1,22295
Lenovo Thinkpad,6178,,,,,,,,"So if you need a laptop urgently, you should get one where stock is available locally.",1,22296
Lenovo Thinkpad,6178,,,,,,,,"If you customize or pre-order, it will take quite long at this point.",1,22297
Lenovo Thinkpad,6178,,,,,,,,Unless the 3 points above improve in the near future.,1,22298
Lenovo Thinkpad,6179,,,,,,,,Just wanted to share my purchase.,1,22299
Lenovo Thinkpad,6179,,,,,,,,I got a Lenovo E595 recently,1,22300

Lenovo Thinkpad,6179,,,,,,,,"Ordered May 15, Shipped May 19, Expected to arrive May 22.",1,22302
Lenovo Thinkpad,6179,,,,,,,,Perhaps its running on the older ryzen and they trying to clear stock.,1,22303
Lenovo Thinkpad,6180,,,,,,,,Better check periodically.,1,22304
Lenovo Thinkpad,6180,,,,,,,,I ordered during first day of cb.,1,22305

Lenovo Thinkpad,6212,,,,,,,,new intel thinkpads avaliable in US.,1,22410
Lenovo Thinkpad,6212,,,,,,,,base on their manual..,1,22411

Lenovo Thinkpad,6212,,,,,,,,if they use this for the amd variant.,1,22413
Lenovo Thinkpad,6212,,,,,,,,better to get T14 for better performance?,1,22414
Lenovo Thinkpad,6213,,,,,,,,Any opinion on this?,1,22415
Lenovo Thinkpad,6213,,,,,,,,I saw last year,1,22416
Lenovo Thinkpad,6213,,,,,,,,NDP period got similar price...,1,22417
Lenovo Thinkpad,6213,,,,,,,,Thinking maybe I sell my XPS 13 hopefully can fetch 2k plus,1,22418
Lenovo Thinkpad,6213,,,,,,,,once I get my new replacement unit and get this...,1,22419
Lenovo Thinkpad,6213,,,,,,,,Upgrade to wireless AX on my own.,1,22420

Lenovo Thinkpad,6214,,,,,,,,still got warranty.,1,22424

Lenovo Thinkpad,6215,,,,,,,,Don't think Legion series has international warranty.,1,22428
Lenovo Thinkpad,6215,,,,,,,,Besides you need to factor in GST unless the seller under-declares the product value.,1,22429
Lenovo Thinkpad,6216,,,,,,,,probably 1k or 1.1k if in good condition...,1,22430
Lenovo Thinkpad,6217,,,,,,,,"1 heatpipe, unless its a big one, otherwise do expect quite a fair bit of throttling.",1,22431

Lenovo Thinkpad,6221,,,,,,,,more formidable assuming cooling is not a problem.,1,22439
Lenovo Thinkpad,6222,,,,,,,,It is.,1,22440
Lenovo Thinkpad,6222,,,,,,,,Intel have nothing to compete in the laptop space when it comes to CPU.,1,22441
Lenovo Thinkpad,6222,,,,,,,,So they start trumpeting the high clockspeed which it can never hit with the cooling capability of almost all the laptops.,1,22442
Lenovo Thinkpad,6222,,,,,,,,GPU wise,1,22443
Lenovo Thinkpad,6222,,,,,,,,", I think Tiger Lake may be able to compete with Renoir, but that is not enough to give them the advantage.",1,22444
Lenovo Thinkpad,6223,,,,,,,,"yup..
looks like T14 is the better choice.",1,22445
Lenovo Thinkpad,6224,,,,,,,,do you have the t495?,1,22446
Lenovo Thinkpad,6224,,,,,,,,Just wondering how performance is like,1,22447
Lenovo Thinkpad,6225,,,,,,,,They compete by cutting prices.,1,22448
Lenovo Thinkpad,6226,,,,,,,,T495 is amazingly good.,1,22449
Lenovo Thinkpad,6226,,,,,,,,"I am using 1 now with 1TB, 32GB Ram and 400 nits display, and even had a SIM slot.",1,22450
Lenovo Thinkpad,6226,,,,,,,,It gets all the job done and had a 89% grade on notebookcheck.com.,1,22451
Lenovo Thinkpad,6226,,,,,,,,If you can wait then get the new Ryzen CPU.,1,22452
Lenovo Thinkpad,6226,,,,,,,,I am eagerly anticipating manufacturers to release their Renoir offerings.,1,22453
Lenovo Thinkpad,6227,,,,,,,,Nope.,1,22454
Lenovo Thinkpad,6227,,,,,,,,"Was originally planning to get a T495, but went with the IdeaPad 5 instead.",1,22455
Lenovo Thinkpad,6227,,,,,,,,My feedback was purely looking at the specs.,1,22456
Lenovo Thinkpad,6227,,,,,,,,"Renoir is clearly a better choice if CPU is your key focus, and less so on the graphics.",1,22457
Lenovo Thinkpad,6227,,,,,,,,"Renoir's top end chip with Vega 7 or 8 may not be a problem, but at the lower end, the Vega 5 and 6, may not fare as well even with a hefty clockspeed advantage when you compare it with the Vega 10 on the 3700U.",1,22458
Lenovo Thinkpad,6228,,,,,,,,Price cutting is not the Intel style man.,1,22459
Lenovo Thinkpad,6228,,,,,,,,"At least looking at current laptops with Intel processors in there, I don't see a meaningful price decline despite Renoir being made official and released.",1,22460
Lenovo Thinkpad,6229,,,,,,,P,"I feel specs and build wise, it is great.",1,22461
Lenovo Thinkpad,6229,,,,,,,,"But cooling wise, I think it is no better than the E485",1,22462

Lenovo Thinkpad,6229,,,,,,,,I suspect it will be soldered.,1,22466
Lenovo Thinkpad,6230,,,,,,,,Thanks.,1,22467
Lenovo Thinkpad,6230,,,,,,,,How much did you pay for this spec?,1,22468
Lenovo Thinkpad,6230,,,,,,,,"Right now the guy on Carousell is offering $1,080 for 8GB RAM or $1,150 with an extra 8GB RAM in the open slot.",1,22469
Lenovo Thinkpad,6230,,,,,,,,I don't know if he can be trusted,1,22470
Lenovo Thinkpad,6230,,,,,,,,but I guess I can look at the box to confirm the specs before buying.,1,22471

Lenovo Thinkpad,6231,,,,,,,,Even the ¬¨√¨base¬¨√Æ Legion 515 with Ryzen 5 4600H,1,22477
Lenovo Thinkpad,6231,P,,,,,,,this new CPU is as fast or slightly faster than i7-9750,1,22478

Lenovo Thinkpad,6233,,,,,,,,Hey guys~ I've been lurking in the dark reading the input that you guys have,1,22490
Lenovo Thinkpad,6233,,,,,,,,shared~,1,22491
Lenovo Thinkpad,6233,,,,,,,,so not sure if anyone know,1,22492
Lenovo Thinkpad,6233,,,,,,,,"but there is a code """,1,22493
Lenovo Thinkpad,6233,,,,,,,,"Shopback18""",1,22494
Lenovo Thinkpad,6233,,,,,,,,that you can use one lenovo sg's site for 18% discount and plus cashback if you use shopback~,1,22495
Lenovo Thinkpad,6233,,,,,,,,My friend configured the Legion 5 for 100% srgb with 512 ssd and 16 gb ram I think~ discount approx 250sgd and cash back,1,22496
Lenovo Thinkpad,6233,,,,,,,,approx 40 sgd~,1,22497
Lenovo Thinkpad,6233,,,,,,,,go,1,22498
Lenovo Thinkpad,6233,,,,,,,,have a try~,1,22499
Lenovo Thinkpad,6233,,,,,,,,No need PM lenovo cs for their code for so much hassel?,1,22500
Lenovo Thinkpad,6233,,,,,,,,haha,1,22501
Lenovo Thinkpad,6233,,,,,,,,The code is valid until 31 May 2020.,1,22502
Lenovo Thinkpad,6233,,,,,,,,Hope it helps,1,22503
Lenovo Thinkpad,6234,,,,,,,,Ryzen 5.,2,22504
Lenovo Thinkpad,6234,,,,,,,,4500U,2,22504
Lenovo Thinkpad,6235,,,,,,,,The CSO code is THANKYOU,1,22505
Lenovo Thinkpad,6235,,,,,,,,but it¬¨√≠s only valid if you include the CSO tag number or something,1,22506
Lenovo Thinkpad,6235,,,,,,,,", not so sure about this.",1,22507
Lenovo Thinkpad,6235,,,,,,,P,But the discount % is different across different models it seems.. and slightly better than Shopback18,1,22508
Lenovo Thinkpad,6236,,,,,,,,Whoops...,1,22509
Lenovo Thinkpad,6236,,,,,,,,Big typo there,1,22510
Lenovo Thinkpad,6236,,,,,,,,Always find it confusing when they refer to 3rd gen Ryzen processors but the model numbers all start with 4000...,1,22511
Lenovo Thinkpad,6237,,,,,,,,Aite thanks!,1,22512
Lenovo Thinkpad,6238,,,,,,,,I rmbr it as Laptop range being one gen behind.. easier Ô£ø√º√≤√ñ,1,22513
Lenovo Thinkpad,6238,,,,,,,,But the 4600/4800H really impressive based on benchmarks on YouTube.,1,22514
Lenovo Thinkpad,6239,,,,,,,,"Flex 5 with DDR4 16gb ram, Ryzen 7 4700u",1,22515
Lenovo Thinkpad,6239,,,,,,,,", 1tb ssd is only $1000+ after the best promo code given by a friendly CA.",1,22516
Lenovo Thinkpad,6240,,,,,,,,The promo codes given by the CSO must be use with including the CSO ID else,1,22517
Lenovo Thinkpad,6240,,,,,,,,You will receive a call asking for the name of the CSO and sadly the order will be cancelled if you are unable to provide The necessary information,1,22518
Lenovo Thinkpad,6241,,,,,,,,Then it means you just need to remember code and CSO ID.,1,22519
Lenovo Thinkpad,6242,,,,,,,,Wonder what's the graphics performance with 16gb of ram?,1,22520
Lenovo Thinkpad,6242,,,,,,,,so far see reviews all is 8g...,1,22521
Lenovo Thinkpad,6242,,,,,,,,dual channel..,1,22522
Lenovo Thinkpad,6242,,,,,,,,how much more performance can we squeeze for the IGPU.,1,22523
Lenovo Thinkpad,6242,,,,,,,,The screen is not fantastic also.. need some calibration i think.,1,22524
Lenovo Thinkpad,6243,,,,,,,,interesting...,1,22525
Lenovo Thinkpad,6243,,,,,,,,vega 6 versus,1,22526
Lenovo Thinkpad,6243,,,,,,,,mx350..,1,22527
Lenovo Thinkpad,6243,,,,,,,,4500U..,1,22528
Lenovo Thinkpad,6243,,,,,,,,So 4700u or 4800u with decent cooling should get us close.,1,22529
Lenovo Thinkpad,6243,P,,,,,,,dual channel fast ram should help also.,1,22530
Lenovo Thinkpad,6243,,,,,,,,feed that beast!,1,22531
Lenovo Thinkpad,6244,,,,,,,,mx350 still very entry right?,1,22532
Lenovo Thinkpad,6245,,,,,,,,New BIOS update 1.57 released for E485/E585,1,22533
Lenovo Thinkpad,6246,P,,,,,,,Mx350 is still a faster card imo.,1,22534
Lenovo Thinkpad,6246,,,,,,,,If based on paper specs.,2,22535
Lenovo Thinkpad,6246,,,,,,,,4600U < 4700U < 4800U,2,22535
Lenovo Thinkpad,6246,,,,,,,,< Mx350,1,22536
Lenovo Thinkpad,6246,,,,,,,,But the difference between 4800U to Mx350 performance very negligible.,1,22537
Lenovo Thinkpad,6246,,,,,,,,If feed the 4800U 3200Mhz ram assuming if it can support yes it will match the mx350.,1,22538
Lenovo Thinkpad,6246,,,,,,,,Its not easy for a iGPU to beat entirely a dedicated gpu such as gtx1650 onwards.,1,22539
Lenovo Thinkpad,6246,,,,,,,,Probably not now.,1,22540
Lenovo Thinkpad,6246,,,,,,,,But in the future it can be done if they can shrink to a smaller process node to pack more transistor.,1,22541
Lenovo Thinkpad,6247,,,,,,,A,Anyone waiting for the new yoga slim 7?,1,22542
Lenovo Thinkpad,6248,,,,,,,,Not too bad.,1,22543
Lenovo Thinkpad,6248,N,,,,,,,It's a slower gtx1050 mobile I think,1,22544
Lenovo Thinkpad,6249,,,,,,,,Ports wise the Acer beats the Lenovo.,1,22545
Lenovo Thinkpad,6249,,,,,,,,"Comes with 10gbps usb 3.1, displayport 1.4, hdmi 2.0 and wifi6.",1,22546
Lenovo Thinkpad,6249,,,,,,,,If you want something more future proof this is it.,1,22547
Lenovo Thinkpad,6249,,,,,,,,No point having so much power when you realise down the road,1,22548
Lenovo Thinkpad,6249,,,,,,,,you cannot hook it up to multiple displays,1,22549
Lenovo Thinkpad,6249,,,,,,,,etc... Limits its potential.,1,22550
Lenovo Thinkpad,6249,,,,,,,,Plus no need to wait 4 weeks for shipping.,1,22551
Lenovo Thinkpad,6250,,,,,,,A,"yep considered ""dedicated"" entry level gpu..",2,22552
Lenovo Thinkpad,6250,,,,,,,P,good enough for light gaming in a slim form factor.,2,22552
Lenovo Thinkpad,6250,,,,,,,,"if can reach that level on a IGPU..feed it with the dual channel high speed ram, decent cooling, drawing lesser power, we got legit hot cake cpu!",1,22553
Lenovo Thinkpad,6250,,,,,,,,Unfortunately we are pretty much limited by what OEM or manufacturer willing to spec..,1,22554
Lenovo Thinkpad,6251,,,,,,,,I felt we should not be expecting a lot from ultra series.,1,22555
Lenovo Thinkpad,6251,,,,,,,,Perhaps just getting the 4500U is the best already.,1,22556
Lenovo Thinkpad,6251,,,,,,,,need to manage battery time also,1,22557
Lenovo Thinkpad,6252,,,,,,,,"I paid $1,123.76 with mouse, bag and 3 years onsite warranty.",1,22558
Lenovo Thinkpad,6252,,,,,,,,T495 hdmi and USB c should be able to power 2 x 4k screen.,1,22559
Lenovo Thinkpad,6252,,,,,,,,please double check,1,22560
Lenovo Thinkpad,6252,,,,,,,P,Running WordPress and lightroom should be fine.,1,22561
Lenovo Thinkpad,6252,,,,,,,,Battery life is worse than Intel version.,1,22562
Lenovo Thinkpad,6252,,,,,,,,Is he selling ryzen 5 or ryzen 7 version?,1,22563
Lenovo Thinkpad,6252,,,,,,,,Please note that mine is Ryzen 5 only.,1,22564
Lenovo Thinkpad,6252,,,,,,,,"If you can, please wait for another 2 months for the new CPU.",1,22565
Lenovo Thinkpad,6252,,,,,,,,The performance is much better then the present CPU.,1,22566
Lenovo Thinkpad,6253,,,,,,,,They had announced price cut at least in America.,1,22567
Lenovo Thinkpad,6254,,,,,,,,"I also had E585, Ryzen 7 2700U, 16GB, 512GB and 1 TB SSD.",1,22568
Lenovo Thinkpad,6254,,,,,,,,"Built quality, T495 is much better.",1,22569
Lenovo Thinkpad,6254,,,,,,,,"And comes with fingerprint, hello windows login.",1,22570
Lenovo Thinkpad,6254,,,,,,,,"Better WiFi, mic and screen.",1,22571
Lenovo Thinkpad,6254,,,,,,,,Of course it also cause more,1,22572
Lenovo Thinkpad,6255,,,,,,,,Ryzen 7,1,22573
Lenovo Thinkpad,6255,,,,,,,,but I guess not much diff since all quad core.,1,22574
Lenovo Thinkpad,6255,,,,,,,,Wow,1,22575
Lenovo Thinkpad,6255,,,,,,,,"okay, didn't know it was so cheap back then",1,22576
Lenovo Thinkpad,6256,,,,,,,,Just saw some shopee and Lazada promoting Lenovo IdeaPad 5 4700U,1,22577
Lenovo Thinkpad,6256,,,,,,,,Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT,1,22578
Lenovo Thinkpad,6257,,,,,,,,They have live chat on the website.,1,22579
Lenovo Thinkpad,6257,,,,,,,,Very eager to answer any query.,1,22580
Lenovo Thinkpad,6257,,,,,,,,Not difficult to get the code.,1,22581
Lenovo Thinkpad,6258,,,,,,,,If you check YouTube..,1,22582
Lenovo Thinkpad,6258,,,,,,,,MX350 means gaming everything on Low 1080P with roughly 40-50 FPS max.,1,22583
Lenovo Thinkpad,6258,,,,,,,,Some even need one notch lower to 900P or 720P.,1,22584
Lenovo Thinkpad,6258,,,,,,,,Not worth it for me..,1,22585
Lenovo Thinkpad,6258,,,,,,,,min is 1650 for me.,1,22586
Lenovo Thinkpad,6258,,,,,,,,Which the Legion can be had for base $1299 before discount.,1,22587
Lenovo Thinkpad,6258,,,,,,,,Around $1180.,1,22588
Lenovo Thinkpad,6259,,,,,,,,You should check out Lenovo's website,1,22589
Lenovo Thinkpad,6260,,,,,,,,Which is why iirc nvidia supposedly going to launch mx450 which make mx350 the lower end model,1,22590
Lenovo Thinkpad,6261,,,,,,,,1080p low with,1,22591
Lenovo Thinkpad,6261,,,,,,,,40-50fps is still pretty good for the weight.,1,22592
Lenovo Thinkpad,6261,,,,,,,P,Mainly for light gaming is fine.,1,22593
Lenovo Thinkpad,6261,,,,,,,,For heavier gaming..,1,22594
Lenovo Thinkpad,6261,,,,,,,,i advise minimum at least a dedicated gpu.,1,22595
Lenovo Thinkpad,6261,,,,,,,,I feel at that point the price and category is different already,1,22596
Lenovo Thinkpad,6262,,,,,,,,agreed.,1,22597
Lenovo Thinkpad,6262,,,,,,,,T495 quality is much better.,1,22598
Lenovo Thinkpad,6262,,,,,,,,Hoping the T14 is good also,1,22599
Lenovo Thinkpad,6263,,,,,,,,indeed it is easy to get the codes but there are many variety of codes granting different % of discount.,1,22600
Lenovo Thinkpad,6263,,,,,,,,Neither LENOVOPRO or THANKYOU gives the best discount.,1,22601
Lenovo Thinkpad,6264,,,,,,,,This would interesting.,1,22602
Lenovo Thinkpad,6264,,,,,,,,big batt..,1,22603
Lenovo Thinkpad,6265,,,,,,,,You are not wrong from the customer standpoint.,1,22604
Lenovo Thinkpad,6265,,,,,,,,"But Say the CSO gave you a limited ""PROMO"" code that can only be given out to selective customers..",1,22605
Lenovo Thinkpad,6265,,,,,,,,"and we, the customer shared around, the CSO will have a hard time explaining to the team head why so many people are using the ""LIMITED"" promo code tagged with his CSO ID.",1,22606
Lenovo Thinkpad,6265,,,,,,,,however the above doesnt apply to THANKYOU & LENOVOPRO as those are not limited promo codes.,1,22607
Lenovo Thinkpad,6265,,,,,,,,so feel free to spam,1,22608
Lenovo Thinkpad,6266,,,,,,,,Now quite expensive,1,22609
Lenovo Thinkpad,6266,,,,,,,,leh.,1,22610
Lenovo Thinkpad,6266,,,,,,,,1.6k for similar config.,1,22611
Lenovo Thinkpad,6266,,,,,,,,You bought during the NDP promo previously?,1,22612
Lenovo Thinkpad,6267,,,,,,,,"CSO ID, that should never change.",1,22613
Lenovo Thinkpad,6267,,,,,,,,"As to why you need to message the CSO for the code in the first place, I think its just pure marketing.",1,22614
Lenovo Thinkpad,6267,,,,,,,,"At the checkout page, they even prompt you to speak to the CSO for better offer.",1,22615
Lenovo Thinkpad,6267,,,,,,,,"Personally, I feel they could have just auto apply the codes, but for PR stunt, this additional step of asking for better offer through the CSO, probably just makes the person feel better after seeing a better discount.",1,22616
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,"Imo, i felt that those wanna game e sports title, you should be getting minimally a gtx1650/Ti.",1,22617
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,This will churn out pretty well fps for those e sports games and some indie games.,1,22618
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,This gtx1650ti wont break the bank with any config be it intel or amd.,1,22619
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,With price bracket between $1.2k-$1.4k depending on the storage and memory config.,1,22620
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,Some AAA game titles you will need a gtx1660Ti instead.,1,22621
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,"This is the so call ¬¨√¨sweet spot¬¨√Æ for 1080p gaming with a few textures tone down in settings, you should be able to rock those games well.",1,22622
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,There is a leap in performance from a gtx1650 to gtx1660Ti.,1,22623
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,"And of cause with that said, it cost anywhere from $1.6k till 2.2k between intel or amd and depending on the storage and memory config.",1,22624
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,Also this category got many price range.,1,22625
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,From lousy screens to good screens.,1,22626
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,With just 10% more improvement comes the rtx2060.,1,22627
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,Now this is where i find its the limit for laptop gaming should go.,1,22628
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,The amount of heat coming out in most gaming laptop can rather be very toasty.,1,22629
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,P,,,,,,,Of cause its faster than the gtx1660Ti.,1,22630
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,But not much difference.,1,22631
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,And most of the laptop pricing starts from 2.2k onwards.,1,22632
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,Then comes the atas rtx2070-2080.,1,22633
Lenovo Thinkpad,6268,,,,,,,,"Which imo, this route is far too ex and a lot of cooling needed for a laptop.",1,22634

Lenovo Thinkpad,6331,,,,,,,,"There are other options like asus um433, 1.1kg",1,22867
Lenovo Thinkpad,6332,,,,,,,,Agree.,1,22868
Lenovo Thinkpad,6332,,,,,,,A,"If want light, should look at Asus zenbook or Acer swift 3/ 5 or LG Gram 13",1,22869
Lenovo Thinkpad,6332,,,,,,,,All around 1Kg,1,22870

Lenovo Thinkpad,6333,,,,,,,,well.... I think Lenovo Singapore will price-match or give a better offer than local Singapore vendors,1,22874
Lenovo Thinkpad,6334,,,,,,,,"You could have saved 100 bucks by going for the GTX 1650, instead of the Ti version.",1,22875
Lenovo Thinkpad,6334,,,,,,,,"Basically Nvidia just upgraded to the GTX 1650 to GDDR6,",1,22876
Lenovo Thinkpad,6334,,,,,,,,so I don't see a difference between the Ti and non Ti version.,1,22877
Lenovo Thinkpad,6335,,,,,,,,"Yes, but they cost more.",1,22878
Lenovo Thinkpad,6335,,,N,,,,,"The Swift 3 is the cheapest, but the display is very poor.",1,22879
Lenovo Thinkpad,6336,,,,,,,A,Asus is the same price A lot lighter and double the storage but half the ram.,1,22880

Lenovo Thinkpad,6337,,,,,,,,"Looks decent, though I would have preferred more RAM than storage.",1,22882
Lenovo Thinkpad,6337,,,,,,,,"The latter can be upgraded, but not the soldered on RAM.",1,22883
Lenovo Thinkpad,6337,,,,,,,,Actually I was reading the review for this Asus laptop version with dedicated GPU,1,22884
Lenovo Thinkpad,6337,,,,,,,,and I kind of wonder,1,22885
Lenovo Thinkpad,6337,,,,,,,,"which ""genius"" came out with the idea of this hidden exhaust between the hinge.",1,22886
Lenovo Thinkpad,6337,,,,,,,,Its a downright dumb design.,1,22887
Lenovo Thinkpad,6337,,,,,,,A,Quite a lot of slim profile laptops come with this silly design because its almost like the vents are semi blocked.,1,22888
Lenovo Thinkpad,6337,,,,,,,,I was also worried about how the hot air coming out from it is cooking my laptop's LCD screen.,1,22889
Lenovo Thinkpad,6338,,,,,,,,"That¬¨√≠s just asus ergo lift vent, think all their zenbook push out hot air like that.",1,22890
Lenovo Thinkpad,6338,,,,,,,,Even the g14 which would be more concerning,1,22891
Lenovo Thinkpad,6339,,,,,,,,The Asus Zenbook models cost quite a bit more ~150.,1,22892
Lenovo Thinkpad,6339,,,,,,,,And I realise they are actually shipping out with 3700U,1,22893
Lenovo Thinkpad,6339,,,,,,,,huh??why???,2,22894
Lenovo Thinkpad,6339,,,,,,,,"Meanwhile, the Acer Swift 3 comes with 4500U, and the warranty is 2yr Carry-in.",2,22894
Lenovo Thinkpad,6339,,,,,,,,"And as mentioned, the display is really bad.",1,22895

Lenovo Thinkpad,6341,,,,,,,,Both Lenovo and asus cost the same -$1398,1,22902
Lenovo Thinkpad,6342,,,,,,,,My friend's Legion 5 arrived liao.,1,22903

Lenovo Thinkpad,6343,,,,,,,,"Hi,Hows the performance and which promo code he used to purchase?",1,22905
Lenovo Thinkpad,6344,,,,,,,,I paid 1263 for the Lenovo.,1,22906
Lenovo Thinkpad,6344,N,,,,,,,"Plus, 3700U is leagues slower than 4700U, since it uses the 12nm Zen architecture.",1,22907
Lenovo Thinkpad,6344,,,,,,,,"If only, the Asus used the 4700U, then it's a no-brainer",1,22908
Lenovo Thinkpad,6345,,,,,,,,Yours seem on discount and not sticker price.,1,22909
Lenovo Thinkpad,6345,,,,,,,,You probably could get the asus for similar price after promo discount.,1,22910
Lenovo Thinkpad,6345,,,,,,,,Got a $1398 zenbook @ $1218 during it,1,22911
Lenovo Thinkpad,6345,,,,,,,,show 2 years ago,1,22912
Lenovo Thinkpad,6345,,,,,,,P,The 3700U is enough for moderate user who want more storage and lighter laptop.,1,22913
Lenovo Thinkpad,6345,,,,,,,,There¬¨√≠s another um433 version with 4700u + mx350,1,22914

Lenovo Thinkpad,6348,,,,,,,,Errr.. I don't think Dell SG will bring in AMD desktop/laptop here.,1,22924
Lenovo Thinkpad,6348,,,,,,,,"Tried to ask them in the past for Ryzen 3 series, they say they won't.",2,22925
Lenovo Thinkpad,6348,,,,,,,,bring in AMD products here.,2,22925
Lenovo Thinkpad,6348,,,,,,,,Not sure whether will change or not but unlikely.,1,22926
Lenovo Thinkpad,6348,,,,,,,,So far they are the only brand that doesn't have any AMD OEM products in SG.,1,22927
Lenovo Thinkpad,6348,,,,,,,,"Asus, HP, Lenovo, Acer all have except Dell.",1,22928
Lenovo Thinkpad,6348,,,,,,,,Those interested may have to buy from Dell US store and there is way to do so.,1,22929
Lenovo Thinkpad,6349,,,,,,,,Hi all the legion has caught my eyes since it seems local g14 gonna be over priced.,1,22930
Lenovo Thinkpad,6349,,,,,,,,I'm reading on some coupon codes?,1,22931
Lenovo Thinkpad,6349,,,,,,,,What's the best deal for a full spec legion 15?,1,22932
Lenovo Thinkpad,6349,,,,,,,,Thanks alot,1,22933
Lenovo Thinkpad,6350,,,,,,,,"G14 and legion not same category though, ~1kg weight / size difference.",1,22934
Lenovo Thinkpad,6350,,,,,,,,In terms of weight / size there¬¨√≠s no alternative to g14 so can try to import it.,1,22935
Lenovo Thinkpad,6350,,,,,,,,Or can wait for a15 with 4900H,1,22936
Lenovo Thinkpad,6351,,,,,,,,Tbh the gtx1650/,1,22937
Lenovo Thinkpad,6351,,,,,,,,Ti is a deal breaker.,1,22938
Lenovo Thinkpad,6351,,,,,,,,"If you really into gaming, you would wanna wait till the gtx1660Ti or rtx2060 be available.",1,22939
Lenovo Thinkpad,6351,,,,,,,,Else you pretty much have to sacrifice a lot of graphics settings just to play smoothly.,1,22940
Lenovo Thinkpad,6351,,,,,,,A,Apart from that the fast 144hz is ok but not meant for editing photos.,1,22941
Lenovo Thinkpad,6351,,,,,,,,But the way if you gonna have the 144hz panel you must reconsider if the gtx1650Ti is even able to produce that many frames for it.,1,22942
Lenovo Thinkpad,6351,,,,,,,,Which imo not easy.,1,22943
Lenovo Thinkpad,6352,,,,,,,,seems like bestbuy is the only option for R9 specced.,1,22944
Lenovo Thinkpad,6352,,,,,,,,looks like the best value as well.,1,22945

Lenovo Thinkpad,6353,,,,,,,,In real world diff in prices,1,22953
Lenovo Thinkpad,6353,,,,,,,,it¬¨√≠s like around $60-70.,1,22954

Lenovo Thinkpad,6354,,,,,,,,$2.5k,1,22956
Lenovo Thinkpad,6354,,,,,,,,Asus SG still think economy very good,1,22957
Lenovo Thinkpad,6355,,,,,,,,Seem like it¬¨√≠s 1650 gddr 5 version though,1,22958

Lenovo Thinkpad,6357,,,,,,,,He said the laptop doesn't feel hot or noisy.,1,22969
Lenovo Thinkpad,6358,,,,,,,P,And the one we are getting for Legion 5 is DDR6 so should be slightly better.,1,22970
Lenovo Thinkpad,6359,,,,,,,,Which would make the jump to 1650ti less worth it,1,22971
Lenovo Thinkpad,6360,,,,,,,,"If that is smooth, i think you might really reconsider.",1,22972
Lenovo Thinkpad,6360,,,,,,,,The frames were between 30+ to 40+ FPS range average.,1,22973
Lenovo Thinkpad,6360,,,,,,,,To play really smoothly you will need to push down more graphic settings to make it 60FPS to be smooth.,1,22974

Lenovo Thinkpad,6400,,,,,,,,cos they will give you the code,1,23092
Lenovo Thinkpad,6400,,,,,,,,btw,1,23093
Lenovo Thinkpad,6400,,,,,,,,"they giving  free Lenovo Legion M200 RGB Gaming Mouse, 2Y Premium Care with Onsite upgrade from 1Y Depot/CCI, Lenovo Legion 15.6-inch Recon Gaming Backpack, Lenovo Original powerbank 5000mAH",1,23094

Lenovo Thinkpad,6403,,,,,,,,"If I can really afford to share, I definitely will,",1,23103
Lenovo Thinkpad,6403,,,,,,,,"but obviously I can't because the promo code is individual sales agent limited, meaning to say each sales agent can only have that limited amount of people using and quote the sales person ID.",1,23104
Lenovo Thinkpad,6403,,,,,,,,Any more they sales agent  will have a hard time to answer for it.,1,23105
Lenovo Thinkpad,6403,,,,,,,,"My point to bring across is the promo codes you guys received from the live chat chaps are not the best and you can only continue to request for the ultimate code and hopefully one of the agent with sufficient "" slot"" can afford to share with you.",1,23106

Lenovo Thinkpad,6404,,,,,,,,It¬¨√≠s,1,23114
Lenovo Thinkpad,6404,,,,,,,,like when I buy a new Mercedes then I quickly go car forum and tell people I got it 10% lower cost than everyone else nett price,1,23115

Lenovo Thinkpad,6404,,,,,,,,Next time such things you keep quiet.,1,23117
Lenovo Thinkpad,6405,,,,,,,,"In your context of mercedes, instead of what you have presented,  it is more of like me sharing there are better promo codes",1,23118
Lenovo Thinkpad,6405,,,,,,,,and you guys need to continue to dig more.,1,23119
Lenovo Thinkpad,6405,,,,,,,,It is a repeatable deal if you can get the agent to disclose to you.,1,23120

Lenovo Thinkpad,6406,,,,,,,,If people know then everyone can just keep trying to get an agent that can give them that % discount.,1,23124

Lenovo Thinkpad,6418,,,,,,,,The discount I gotten was from one CSO rep whom I mentioned that I have the shopback18 promo discount code,1,23149
Lenovo Thinkpad,6418,,,,,,,,and if they were to provide me another 2% discount from the cart I will order it immediately.,1,23150
Lenovo Thinkpad,6418,,,,,,,,Hence this price and the rep manual override the cart price from their end.,1,23151
Lenovo Thinkpad,6419,,,,,,,,"Got one CSO mentioned they additional 2% off is case by case basis, based on specs you chose.",1,23152
Lenovo Thinkpad,6419,,,,,,,,If you max it out then the deal is too good then likely their manager,1,23153
Lenovo Thinkpad,6419,,,,,,,,won¬¨√≠t approve the 2% adjustment.,1,23154
Lenovo Thinkpad,6419,,,,,,,,So $1405.50 is the best if you want Max CPU RAM GPU and 512GB SSD.,1,23155
Lenovo Thinkpad,6419,,,,,,,,Before CC/Shopback rebate.,1,23156
Lenovo Thinkpad,6419,,,,,,,,If you drop the Ti version for GPU,1,23157

Lenovo Thinkpad,6437,,,,,,,,before 5% shopback,1,23233
Lenovo Thinkpad,6438,,,,,,,,"Hi,if using promo code not from shopback still eligible for the cashback?",1,23234
Lenovo Thinkpad,6439,,,,,,,,Wrong concept.,1,23235
Lenovo Thinkpad,6439,,,,,,,,2280 has more space to distribute heat as it is longer vs 2242 version.,1,23236
Lenovo Thinkpad,6440,,,,,,,,170Watt power supply.,1,23237
Lenovo Thinkpad,6440,,,,,,,,This laptop sure taking up lots of power.,1,23238
Lenovo Thinkpad,6441,,,,,,,,It is true that 2280 have more space for better heat distribution.,1,23239

Lenovo Thinkpad,6442,,,,,,,,"This is a gaming grade laptop, so not unexpected that the power supply is higher.",1,23245
Lenovo Thinkpad,6442,,,,,,,,"In fact, I feel whether it really consumes that much power or not, I rather they provide a higher waltage power supply just in case.",1,23246

Lenovo Thinkpad,6442,,,,,,,,My guess is that the full power draw may end up peaking around 150W based on the specs.,1,23248

Lenovo Thinkpad,6506,,,,,,,,when is multitouch useful??,1,23437
Lenovo Thinkpad,6507,,,,,,,,sometimes its really just easy to touch compared to moving the mouse.,1,23438

Lenovo Thinkpad,6508,,,,,,,,Especially when i read Journal in PDF.,1,23442
Lenovo Thinkpad,6508,,,,,,,,something its better to just pinch to zoom.,1,23443
Lenovo Thinkpad,6508,,,,,,,,Often i just carry my laptop without a mouse,1,23444
Lenovo Thinkpad,6508,,,,,,,,so touch screen is just a bonus that i need.,1,23445
Lenovo Thinkpad,6509,,,,,,,,I used to carry a mouse,1,23446
Lenovo Thinkpad,6509,,,,,,,,but then I graduated from having a mouse.,1,23447
Lenovo Thinkpad,6509,,,,,,,A,I think i can survive w/o a mouse as long as the trackpad is good.,1,23448
Lenovo Thinkpad,6509,,,,,,,,"So if that's the case , multitouch will be a good add-on?",1,23449
Lenovo Thinkpad,6509,,,,,,,A,"But recently when I WFH, I went back to keyboard + mouse because I have an ext kb.",1,23450

Lenovo Thinkpad,6512,,,,,,,,I guess it's the first time they are selling the 16gb model on their official store,1,23463
Lenovo Thinkpad,6512,,,,,,,,so they call it new launch.,1,23464
Lenovo Thinkpad,6512,,,,,,,,Wait a month or two and probably the new Envy,1,23465
Lenovo Thinkpad,6512,,,,,,,,x360 will launch here,1,23466

Lenovo Thinkpad,6519,,,,,,,,Mine is 19Jun,1,23531
Lenovo Thinkpad,6520,,,,,,,,Ordered mine on the 24th of May and received today.,1,23532
Lenovo Thinkpad,6520,,,,,,,,Haven't done much with it yet except opening it up to slot in another SSD.,1,23533
Lenovo Thinkpad,6520,,,,,,,,It does comes with a dummy SATA HDD cage and the SATA connector.,1,23534
Lenovo Thinkpad,6520,,,,,,,,Removing the cage and the connector reveals the 2nd NVME slot.,1,23535
Lenovo Thinkpad,6520,,,,,,,P,The slot is slightly raised so double sided NVME will be ok.,1,23536
Lenovo Thinkpad,6520,,,,,,,,Not sure about the main slot as I did not touch that.,1,23537
Lenovo Thinkpad,6521,,,,,,,,"cool, 2 weeks !",1,23538
Lenovo Thinkpad,6522,,,,,,,,Not sure if the combinations of the specs affected the speed of the delivery.,1,23539
Lenovo Thinkpad,6522,,,,,,,,I believe it was estimating the delivery time to be between 4 to 6 weeks.,1,23540
Lenovo Thinkpad,6522,,,,,,,,When I swapped the graphics card to the 1650TI,1,23541
Lenovo Thinkpad,6522,,,,,,,,it went down to just 4 weeks.,1,23542

Lenovo Thinkpad,6525,,,,,,,,The intention was to swap it out with a 512GB 2280 SSD,1,23548
Lenovo Thinkpad,6525,,,,,,,,but since there's another slot there,1,23549
Lenovo Thinkpad,6525,,,,,,,,so I just kept the 256GB in and slot in the other SSD.,1,23550

mbp 16,8121,,,,,,,,The Apple Care+ costs $549.,1,28382
mbp 16,8121,,,,,,,,Has it always been that expensive?,1,28383
mbp 16,8121,,,,,,,,I think the one for my iMac is less than $400.,1,28384
mbp 16,8122,,,,,,,,It was AppleCare previously which cost around $300+.,1,28385
mbp 16,8122,,,,,,,,Now they change to AppleCare+ which covers accidental damage.,1,28386
mbp 16,8123,,,,,,,,I was quoted student price about 45x by the Apple staff.,1,28387
mbp 16,8123,,,,,,,,It is about 15% of the price of the base model,1,28388
mbp 16,8123,,,,,,,,Maybe those getting higher end specs can consider,1,28389
mbp 16,8124,,,,,,,,Why do you have two MacBook Pro?,1,28390
mbp 16,8125,,,,,,,,Just received tracking no.,1,28391
mbp 16,8125,,,,,,,,for shipment on sat,1,28392
mbp 16,8126,,,,,,,,Bought the first one and 4 years later the MacBook Pro in already auto shut down.,1,28393
mbp 16,8126,,,,,,,,Went to repair was quoted logic board spoil so buy new one,1,28394
mbp 16,8127,,,,,,,,Not really.,1,28395
mbp 16,8127,,,,,,,,I never buy AppleCare for my MacBook Pro 13-inch 2017.,1,28396
mbp 16,8127,,,,,,,,"Even after warranty, I still get battery replaced for free.",1,28397
mbp 16,8128,,,,,,,,Oh I see.,1,28398
mbp 16,8128,,,,,,,,Why don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t just sell one.,1,28399
mbp 16,8128,,,,,,,,How are you going to use 2 anyway?,1,28400
mbp 16,8129,,,,,,,,Well you can choose not to buy.,1,28401
mbp 16,8129,,,,,,,,It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s your choice.,1,28402
mbp 16,8129,,,,,,,,"But for Mac, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s going to be a long term investment",1,28403
mbp 16,8129,,,,,,,,so AppleCare+ is critical given you can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t replace most of the parts yourself.,1,28404
mbp 16,8130,,,,,,,,Same here.,1,28405
mbp 16,8130,,,,,,,,"I've owned a 2010 MBP and graphics dead by 2015, hence bought the 2015 model and still using it now.",1,28406
mbp 16,8130,,,,,,,,Both I've never bought any AppleCare.,1,28407
mbp 16,8131,,,,,,,,Both are actually still available.,1,28408
mbp 16,8131,,,,,,,,Just that Apple Care+ needs to be purchased within 60 days while normal Apple Care can be within a year.,1,28409
mbp 16,8131,,,,,,,,The difference in price is just $20-30.,1,28410
mbp 16,8132,,,,,,,,Does anyone know if AppleCare+ is a full refund after one day of use for returning the MacBook?,1,28411
mbp 16,8133,,,,,,,,No one want to buy so,1,28412
mbp 16,8133,,,,,,,,just keep,1,28413
mbp 16,8134,,,,,,,,True true.,1,28414
mbp 16,8134,,,,,,,,I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know how much can my 13‚Äö√Ñ√π 2015 MacBook Pro fetch.,1,28415

mbp 16,8138,,,,,,,,Just got my 16 inch today at Apple Store.,1,28420
mbp 16,8138,,,,,,,,"So far loving it, but the battery lifespan not as good as advertised leh.",1,28421
mbp 16,8138,,,,,N,,,"Keeps draining pretty fast, is this normal as it takes some time to be optimised?",1,28422
mbp 16,8138,,,,,,,,Aside from that - the speakers are lovely.,1,28423
mbp 16,8138,,,,,,,,Anyone knows whether any shop sells accessories like screen protector?,1,28424
mbp 16,8139,,,,,,,,I feel the same as u regarding battery life.,1,28425
mbp 16,8139,,,,,,,,W/o using adobe,1,28426
mbp 16,8140,,,,,,,,You are returning the Macbook Pro alreadY?,1,28427
mbp 16,8141,,,,,,,,First few days usually will drain more power due to the indexing process.,1,28428
mbp 16,8142,,,,,,,,Its normal,1,28429
mbp 16,8142,,,,,,,,"My first day with a mbp13‚Äö√Ñ√π, the batt went from 100-0 in 4-5 hours.",1,28430
mbp 16,8142,,,,,,,,Hardly any usage.,1,28431
mbp 16,8142,,,,,,,,Just indexing and syncing with iCloud,1,28432
mbp 16,8142,,,,,,,,Subsequently then ok,1,28433
mbp 16,8143,,,,,,,,"Ok thanks guys, that is more reassuring.",1,28434
mbp 16,8144,,,,,,,,Update us again maybe 3 days later.,1,28435
mbp 16,8145,,,,,,,,Did consider because next year is Face ID.,1,28436
mbp 16,8146,,,,,,,,Not happening bruh,1,28437
mbp 16,8147,,,,,,,,Haha.,1,28438
mbp 16,8147,,,,,,,,I dropped the idea of returning already.,1,28439
mbp 16,8147,,,,,,,,Got to stop with all the buyer‚Äö√Ñ√¥s remorse.,1,28440
mbp 16,8147,,,,,,,,Buy already and feel bad.,1,28441
mbp 16,8148,,,,,,,,Wah.,1,28442
mbp 16,8148,,,,,,,,You want to return for a rumor?,1,28443
mbp 16,8148,,,,,,,,Minimum need to wait for one more year even if it is true.,1,28444
mbp 16,8148,,,,,,,,This version is very well received so don¬¨√≠t,1,28445
mbp 16,8148,,,,,,,,they will be so keen to refresh it so quickly.,1,28446
mbp 16,8149,,,,,,,,I just feel no point to return.,1,28447
mbp 16,8149,,,,,,,,This one is probably the most stable one since it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s design.,1,28448
mbp 16,8149,,,,,,,,Next design might come in a mess,1,28449
mbp 16,8150,,,,,,,,Agree.,1,28450
mbp 16,8150,,N,,,,,,"Just like the 2015 MacBook Pro which is their best and most stable iteration until 2016, they itchy finger, introduce the butterfly keyboard, Touch Bar etc. Ô£ø√º√≤√á",1,28451
mbp 16,8151,,,,,,,,I think the biggest value to upgrade from my 13‚Äö√Ñ√π 2015 one is the Touch ID.,1,28452
mbp 16,8151,,,,,,,,It bought me so much convenience.,1,28453
mbp 16,8152,P,,,,,,,There will be a refresh definitely to the 10th Gen Intel Processor and more powerful GPU.,1,28454
mbp 16,8152,,,,,,,,Probably within the next 6 months.,1,28455
mbp 16,8153,P,,,,,,,10th Intel Chip also comes with faster RAM speed.....,1,28456
mbp 16,8153,,,,,,,,which might also cost more~,1,28457
mbp 16,8153,,,,,,,,but wifi6 is nice.,1,28458
mbp 16,8154,,,,,,,,Next year 14‚Äö√Ñ√π MacBook Pro,1,28459
mbp 16,8155,,,,,,,,The bigger screen size should look amazing too.,1,28460
mbp 16,8156,,,,,,,,"Got mine also MBP16, I think now is to start another thread for the accessories Ô£ø√º√≤√ú",1,28461
mbp 16,8157,,,,,,,,Aka MacBook Pro dongle thread.,1,28462
mbp 16,8158,,,,,,,A,Mine not here opted for delivery which is slower yet but interested to see what sleeve can be used.,1,28463
mbp 16,8158,,,,,,,,Hopefully not too ex.,1,28464
mbp 16,8159,,,,,,,,Base model?,1,28465
mbp 16,8159,,,,,,,,Or high spec version?,1,28466
mbp 16,8160,,,,,,,,I am thinking apple is going for the iPad strategies on MacBook for the time being.,1,28467
mbp 16,8160,,,,,,,,MacBook Air being the cheapest macbook one can get.,1,28468
mbp 16,8160,,,,,,,,This is similar to the the basic iPad while you dun get all the best tech but allow you to have access to macbook at a cheaper starting price.,1,28469
mbp 16,8160,,,,,,,,"As a contrast, MacBook Pro 13-inch is positioned like iPad Air, better display and processing power.",1,28470
mbp 16,8160,,,,,,,,"MacBook Pro 16-inch is like the iPad Pro, which it has the best of everything, including the best appearance, best features, best iPhone ever processing power and graphic with all the options to make it really pro including upgrading the storage to the ridiculous possible size etc.",1,28471
mbp 16,8161,,,,,,,,This is the best mb pro with scissor kb Liao.,1,28472
mbp 16,8161,,,,,,,,If return..,1,28473
mbp 16,8161,,,,,,,,the waiting game is no joke.,1,28474
mbp 16,8161,,,,,,,,Rather keep and use if new one comes by then sell and ‚Äö√Ñ√≤upgrade‚Äö√Ñ√¥,1,28475
mbp 16,8162,,,,,,,,"I got the 8 core, 1TB one",1,28476

mbp 16,8166,,,,,,,,Should be around 150 after shipping,1,28482
mbp 16,8167,,,,,,,,Thanks for the recommendations!,1,28483
mbp 16,8167,,,,,,,,Is there any that is connect directly at the side of the laptop?,1,28484
mbp 16,8167,,,,,,,,Means no cable involved..,1,28485
mbp 16,8167,,,,,,,,cuz my portable hdd alr got cable Ô£ø√º√≤√ñ if nt v messy,1,28486
mbp 16,8168,,,,,,,,This one go for hyper,1,28487
mbp 16,8169,,,,,,,,Yeap I agree.,1,28488
mbp 16,8169,,,,,,,,Else go for Satechi.,1,28489
mbp 16,8169,,,,,,,,The 2 more reputable brands.,1,28490
mbp 16,8170,,,,,,,,I recommend hyperdrive too.,1,28491
mbp 16,8170,,,,,,,,I am using the 9 in 1 one.,1,28492
mbp 16,8170,,,,,,,,But has a cable dangling though.,1,28493
mbp 16,8171,,,,,,,,Anyone experienced popping sound in the speakers when you stop an audio track Spotify or close a youtube video when it is playing?,1,28494
mbp 16,8171,,,,,,,,It doesn't affect me much but still unsettles me.,1,28495
mbp 16,8172,,,,,,,,Yes.,1,28496
mbp 16,8172,,,,,,,,"On my 16"" Macbook Pro.",1,28497
mbp 16,8172,,,,,,,,I have already sent feedback to,1,28498
mbp 16,8173,,,,,,,,Yea I googled and found this to be a common issue unfortunately.,1,28499
mbp 16,8173,,,,,,,,Can update if they get back to you?,1,28500
mbp 16,8173,,,,,,,,I need the laptop for my exams over the next 2 weeks,1,28501
mbp 16,8173,,,,,,,,so I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t bring it down to Apple Store to check yet.,1,28502
mbp 16,8174,,,,,,,,Yes a lot of cracking sound,1,28503
mbp 16,8175,,,,,,,,My friend also confirmed can hear.,1,28504
mbp 16,8175,,,,,,,,Hopefully it is just an issue that can be solved with software update.,1,28505
mbp 16,8175,,,,,,,,Else there will a major recall for a this excellent MacBook.,1,28506
mbp 16,8176,,,,,,,,No need to bring down.,1,28507
mbp 16,8176,,,,,,,,"Even if you go for a replacement, likely to get back one with the same issue.",1,28508
mbp 16,8177,,,,,,,,does the cracking sound last very long or jus a split second type~?,1,28509
mbp 16,8178,,,,,,,,"It happens in a split second, when I close a YouTube video for instance.",1,28510
mbp 16,8178,,,,,,,,It doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t affect my workflow whatsoever,1,28511
mbp 16,8178,,,,,,,,but it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s definitely loud and annoying.,1,28512
mbp 16,8178,,,,,,,,I read that it occurs frequently for those using FCP to edit videos.,1,28513
mbp 16,8179,,,,,,,,Okay.,1,28514
mbp 16,8179,,,,,,,,Keeping my 16‚Äö√Ñ√π and trading in with brightstar for my 13‚Äö√Ñ√π 2015 one.,1,28515
mbp 16,8179,,,,,,,,Bought in Australia so it came with an Australian plug head.,1,28516
mbp 16,8180,,,,,,,,How much is Brightstar offering you?,1,28517
mbp 16,8181,,,,,,,,Around $300+,1,28518
mbp 16,8182,,,,,,,,What are the specs?,1,28519
mbp 16,8183,,,,,,,,I cannot remember in detail .,1,28520
mbp 16,8183,,,,,,,,It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s the basic 13‚Äö√Ñ√π 2015 pro model.,1,28521
mbp 16,8183,,,,,,,,8GB RAM.,1,28522
mbp 16,8183,,,,,,,,No graphics card,1,28523
mbp 16,8184,,,,,,,,I asked because a relative of mine managed to sell his 13‚Äö√Ñ√π retina 2013 for $400 on carsousell a couple of months back.,1,28524
mbp 16,8185,,,,,,,,Older MacBook Pro really convenient with the ports available,1,28525
mbp 16,8186,,,,,,,,Carousell probably can fetch higher price but must be prepared to meet all sort of buyers including those last minute no show or bargain on the spot.,1,28526
mbp 16,8186,,,,,,,,Some have expectations whatever you are selling to be in a perfect condition like brand new even though it is few years ago.,1,28527
mbp 16,8186,,,,,,,,BrightStar is more straightforward and save you time and frustration of dealing with such buyers.,1,28528
mbp 16,8187,,,,,,,,Get used to it.,1,28529
mbp 16,8187,,,,,,,,Soon there will be no ports,1,28530
mbp 16,8188,,,,,,,,That¬¨√≠s also one of the reason why I don¬¨√≠t wish to change my 2015 MBP yet.,1,28531
mbp 16,8189,,,,,,,,No USB ports jin Sian,1,28532
mbp 16,8190,,,,,,,,My favourite mouse requires USB port.,1,28533
mbp 16,8190,,,,,,,P,Older macbook feel more sturdy also and the Apple logo does light up.,1,28534
mbp 16,8190,,,,,,,,I find the older kb more tactile too,1,28535
mbp 16,8191,,,,,,,,You summed up the reasons why I am lazy to deal with Carousell buyers.,1,28536
mbp 16,8192,,,,,,,,"Hey all, another Student here...",1,28537
mbp 16,8192,,,,,,,,"I'm seriously considering getting the 16"" MBP now.",1,28538
mbp 16,8192,,,,,,,,"But if I get it, bootcamp must function just as well as a typical windows 10 laptop.",1,28539
mbp 16,8192,,,,,,,,This is because my school is predominately a windows-only environment.,1,28540
mbp 16,8192,,,,,,,,Most softwares of my course are exclusive to windows only.,2,28541
mbp 16,8192,,,,,,,,I can't get a windows laptop as my photography/filmmaking hobby heavily relies on Mac OS.,2,28541
mbp 16,8192,,,,,,,,Photoshop + FCPX user,1,28542

mbp 16,8192,,,,,N,,,"I heard that the dedicated Radeon Graphics is forever switched-on, hence draining the battery significantly faster compared to Mac OS.",1,28544
mbp 16,8192,,,,,,,,Correct me if I'm wrong,1,28545
mbp 16,8193,,,,,,,,You might want to use a VM like Parallels instead of running Bootcamp.,1,28546
mbp 16,8194,,,,,,,,Just got hands on the 16 inch MacBook Pro at i Studio just now,1,28547
mbp 16,8194,,,,,,,,I used the 13 inch compare to 16 inch like no difference,1,28548
mbp 16,8194,,P,,,,,,The keyboard feels like the same as 13 inch just ticker that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s all.,1,28549
mbp 16,8195,,,,,,,,VM will struggle as the windows programs I use are CPU + GPU intensive.,1,28550
mbp 16,8195,,,,,,,,eg.,1,28551
mbp 16,8195,,,,,,,,3D Modelling with 3DS Max & Revit,1,28552
mbp 16,8195,,,,,,,,"Btw, these Radeon 5000M series graphics work way better than the GTX1650s that are found on most windows laptops.",1,28553
mbp 16,8195,,,,,,,,They're very much optimised for workstation use.,1,28554
mbp 16,8195,,,,,,,,That's why I'm so inclined to go for Macs even though they're not windows native devices.,1,28555
mbp 16,8196,,,,,,,,I find VM too laggy for me...,1,28556
mbp 16,8196,,,,,,,,bootcamp is my preference.,1,28557
mbp 16,8196,,,,,,,,Running bootcamp has it pros and cons.,1,28558
mbp 16,8196,,,,,,,,"Macbook pro is a very solid hardware, so far never have a BSOD.",1,28559
mbp 16,8196,,,,,,,,Compared to my other new i9 Lenovo which BSOD at least once a day.,1,28560
mbp 16,8196,P,,,,,,,"The downside, it runs hot and the fan spin-up very quickly even on light loads.",1,28561
mbp 16,8196,,,,,,,,"Guess its the combination of win 10 and driver issues e.g, unable to turn off the GFX when idling.",1,28562
mbp 16,8196,,,,,,,,"Now matter how it drains the battery, it still outlast the lenovo.",1,28563
mbp 16,8196,,,,,,,,The retina screen is the sharpest and best color accurate one...,1,28564

mbp 16,8196,,,,,,,,"But if you just run MS office, its an overkill and waste of $$$.",1,28566

mba 2020,8556,,,,,,,,It is probably not designed for a quad core processor i5/i7.,1,29714
mba 2020,8557,,,,,,,,They probably should have stick to not making the processor configurable i.e keeping it to standard i3 for all MacBook Air.,1,29715

mba 2020,8576,,,,,,,,Just running chrome alone will cause the processor heat up to 100c.,1,29776

mba 2020,8582,,,,,,,,The alternative left is basically Chrome.,1,29798
mba 2020,8582,,,,,,,,But the point is this,1,29799
mba 2020,8582,,,,,,,,", you replace chrome with iMovie, spotify, it's still going to run at close to 100c and spoil quicker.",1,29800
mba 2020,8582,,,,,,,,Simply because the fan isn't connected to the heatsink which is ridiculous.,1,29801
mba 2020,8582,,,,,,,,Even the 2015 air's heatsink is connected.,1,29802
mba 2020,8583,,,,,,,,"You have alternative, which is to use Edge Chromium.",1,29803

mba 2020,8586,,,,,,,,It still runs flawlessly today with the latest version.,1,29815
mba 2020,8586,,,,,,,,Safari is overall a more fluid experience than Chrome.,1,29816
mba 2020,8586,,,,,,,,I only use Chrome if I want to stream 4K or 8K Videos on YouTube; features that aren't available on Safari.,1,29817

mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,This laptop is fine.,1,29829
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,The temps are just too high for my liking for menial tasks and the fan is just annoying.,1,29830
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,A,"For a company that usually loves to market their products as silent and thin and light, them not including a heatpipe to prevent the fans from spinning up too much",1,29831
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,is just weird.,1,29832
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,"I understand the design of the fan, as it is acting more as a case fan than a direct CPU fan, however just adding a heatpipe would have cooled the CPU so much better and allowed it to stretch its legs more.",1,29833
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,The laptop stutters alot for me too.,1,29834
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,"Sometimes i wake the laptop up in the morning, my apps are stuttering.",1,29835
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,I dont know if this is a catalina issue or a macbook air issue.,1,29836

mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,", 15inch has in 4 years.",1,29839
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,I would really recommend waiting for the 13inch macbook pro refresh.,1,29840
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,A,"Even if its just a keyboard refresh and nothing more, I would still recommend you to wait haha.",1,29841
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,Its rumored to be in may.,1,29842
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,The prices will stay the same probably,1,29843
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,but the storage will be doubled.,1,29844
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,So you could probably get a 256gb/8gb mbp13 for maybe S$2199.,1,29845
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,"As off right now, on the apple singapore store, the 2thunderbolt 3 model with 128gbssd and 8gb ram is $1899, 256gb ssd model is $2199.",1,29846

mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,all come standard with 4 thunderbolt 3 ports to differentiate it from the macbook air.,1,29848
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,So my guess would be a new 13inch model with 256gb ssd and 8gb ram for 2199.,1,29849
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,or at most $2299.,1,29850
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,That gives it a wide enough gap in terms of price vs the $1449 MBA 2020 and far enough from the base $3499,1,29851
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,16inch mbp.,1,29852
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,As for me I will be aiming for a 512gb and 16gb model.,1,29853
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,Hopefully that will be priced at $2599 or $2699,1,29854
mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,"Also keep in mind, if you watch alot of youtubers doing all these benchmakrs and testing of temperatures.",1,29855

mba 2020,8589,,,,,,,,We are always in humid 29 - 33 degree weather.,1,29857

mba 2020,8621,,,,,,,,Depending on the news I am considering of returning the MacBook Air for the Pro.,2,29969
mba 2020,8621,,,,,,,,Overall the day to day usage for me has been relatively good.,2,29969
mba 2020,8621,,,,,,,,Battery life can last me from 8am to 10pm 1130 - 2pm no usage before needing to charge again.,1,29970
mba 2020,8622,,,,,,,,That's another option,1,29971
mba 2020,8622,,,,,,,,but I'm assuming it'll cost around 3K when I specced it the way I want,1,29972
mba 2020,8623,,,,,,,,Hmm... I would say you just need to upgrade the RAM to 16GB and stick with 256GB of storage.,1,29973
mba 2020,8623,,,,,,,,The processor for the new base model MBP13¬¨√Æ is definitely better than the one in MBA13¬¨√Æ.,1,29974

mba 2020,8628,,,,,,,,"Not sure if it was deliberate or not,",1,29983
mba 2020,8628,,,,,,,,but I would wait a little longer to see if the new pros that is rumoured to be out this mod this month.,1,29984
mba 2020,8628,,,,,,,,Will wait for it to be stripped down before deciding as my MBA 2020 is max specced.,1,29985
mba 2020,8628,,,,,,,,I probably won¬¨√≠t feel much of a difference if it was the new pro.,1,29986

mba 2020,8639,,,,,,,,So you will be keeping it to do development?,1,30014
mba 2020,8640,,,,,,,,not only that.,1,30015

mba 2020,8641,,,,,,,,Anyone knows what's the maximum WiFi speed?,1,30019
mba 2020,8641,,,,,,,,Is it 866 Mbps?,1,30020
mba 2020,8642,,,,,,,,I believe for MacBook Air,1,30021
mba 2020,8642,,,,,,,,the antenna should be 3x3 MIMO,1,30022
mba 2020,8642,,,,,,,,so maximum speed on AC should be 1300Mbps,1,30023
mba 2020,8642,,,,,,,,but you won¬¨√≠t achieve this speed anyway.,1,30024
mba 2020,8643,,,,,,,,The processor used is different.,1,30025
mba 2020,8643,,,,,,,,MBA is using the Y series while 13¬¨√Æ,1,30026
mba 2020,8643,,,,,,,,Pro is using the U series.,1,30027
mba 2020,8643,N,,,,,,,MBP gives you more processing power and also faster RAM.,1,30028
mba 2020,8643,,,,,,,,Oh did I mention better thermal design?,1,30029
mba 2020,8643,,,,,,,,Yeah,1,30030
mba 2020,8643,P,,,,,,,so all will result in faster and more stable performance.,1,30031
mba 2020,8644,,,,,,,,"oh, isn't the ram same speed 3733mhz for both?",1,30032
mba 2020,8644,,,,,,,,and also mbp has fan to the cpu heatsink.,1,30033
mba 2020,8644,,,,,,,,I think apple purposely leave this out on the MBA so that it is not even close to competing with the pros.,1,30034
mba 2020,8645,,,,,,,,Yes my bad.,1,30035
mba 2020,8645,,,,,,,,I was comparing between the base model.,1,30036

LG brand 14,9231,,,,,,,A,BT/Wifi/Kb light turned off.,1,31959
LG brand 14,9231,,,,,,,,With my previous CYGNETT 27000mah,1,31960
LG brand 14,9231,,,,,,,A,100W PD power bank I can only achieved 80% of the laptop battery level before it stops charging with one blinking light still on the power bank.,1,31961
LG brand 14,9231,,,,,,,,Full charge of the laptop takes about 2 hrs,1,31962
LG brand 14,9231,,,,,,,,"Secondly, charging the ZENDURE Supertank power bank.",2,31963

LG brand 14,9231,,,,,,,,According to YouTube reviews if you use the ZENDURE SuperPort 4 100W USB-C desktop charger you should be able to full charge the Supertank power bank within 1 hr????.,1,31965

LG brand 14,9231,,,,,,,,Actual charging revealed about 1hr 45 min for a full charge.,1,31967
LG brand 14,9231,,,,,,,,What I Like,1,31968
LG brand 14,9231,,,,,,,A,1 Lighter weight at 500gm.,1,31969
LG brand 14,9231,,,,,,,,"Generally, most 27000mah power banks go into the 600",1,31970

LG brand 14,9231,,,,,,,,2 Not sure the default power bank charging cable's compatiblility with the APPLE 96W USB-C ac charger.,2,31976

LG brand 14,9385,,,,,,,,I took a look again and measured uniformity with a colour calibrator...,1,32535
LG brand 14,9385,,,,,,,,Seems within the tolerance range.,1,32536
LG brand 14,9385,,,,,,,,Probably just my eyes?,1,32537
LG brand 14,9385,,,,,,,,but because the laptop isn't compatible with my 4k TV at 60hz for some reason.,1,32538
LG brand 14,9385,,,,,,,,Not a hardware issue since it works fine with LG monitors.,1,32539
LG brand 14,9385,,,,,,,,Probably a bug in the firmware somewhere but difficult to fix since they are from different brands?,1,32540
LG brand 14,9385,,,,,,,,"Anyway, not to say the LG is bad or what.",1,32541
LG brand 14,9385,,,,,,,,For most users it is a good laptop.,1,32542

LG brand 14,9386,,,,,,,,Realise I max out at 120hz thru hdmi port.,1,32545
LG brand 14,9386,,,,,,,,"Think probably the port has not enough bandwidth for full hdmi 2.0 since it has to drive 2 Gen2 USB ports, up to 2 NVMe SSD and thunderbolt 3 too",1,32546
LG brand 14,9387,,,,,,,,From below.,2,32547
LG brand 14,9387,,,,,,,,HDMI 1.4 supports at 30Hz,2,32547
LG brand 14,9387,,,,,,,,HDMI 1.4b supports up to 60Hz,1,32548
LG brand 14,9387,,,,,,,,HDMI 2.0 supports up to 60Hz.,2,32549
LG brand 14,9387,,,,,,,,HDMI 2.1,2,32549
LG brand 14,9387,,,,,,,,can support up to 120Hz,1,32550
LG brand 14,9387,,,,,,,,I think the LG GRAM comes with HDMI 1.4 if I'm not wrong.,1,32551
LG brand 14,9387,,,,,,,,If it's true then how come you are getting 120Hz?,1,32552
LG brand 14,9388,,,,,,,,It is not stated.,1,32553
LG brand 14,9388,,,,,,,,Called LG hotline before I bought,1,32554
LG brand 14,9388,,,,,,,,but no one could give me an answer.,1,32555
LG brand 14,9388,,,,,,,,Destiny88 mentioned it's HDMI 1.4,1,32556
LG brand 14,9388,,,,,,,,previously,1,32557
LG brand 14,9388,,,,,,,,"but if it's HDMI 1.4, it can only drive 4K at 30Hz and 1440p at 75Hz.",1,32558
LG brand 14,9388,,,,,,,,"However, when I tested in Best Denki on their LG monitor, I can manage to get 4K at 60Hz, which seems to mean that it supports HDMI 2.0.",1,32559
LG brand 14,9388,,,,,,,,"But based on my experience so far, it seems like the HDMI 2.0 support is ""in between""",1,32560
LG brand 14,9388,,,,,,,,", cos 4k at 60Hz doesn't work on my 4K TV and 1440p",1,32561
LG brand 14,9388,,,,,,,,only works at 120Hz on my Acer monitor,1,32562
LG brand 14,9388,,,,,,,,but this also means it is better than HDMI 1.4 which will cap at 75hz.,1,32563
LG brand 14,9388,,,,,,,,"So I was just wondering if anyone has a 1440p 144hz monitor or 4k monitor who can share his or her experiences as well, so I can report the problem to LG or if officially, it can only support up to HDMI 1.4b.",1,32564
LG brand 14,9388,,,,,,,,"The Usb-c to hdmi 2.0 adapter I have works fine at 4k 60hz and 1440p144, so not a big issue.",1,32565

LG brand 14,9389,,,,,,,,Look at my above posting again.,1,32571
LG brand 14,9389,,,,,,,,I think the LG GRAM could be using the HDMI 1.4b spec,1,32572

Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,9451,,,,,,,,"Initial crashes for my case has nothing to do with AMD, but rather the motherboard maker pushing too much voltage to my CPU even on auto settings which is causing it to overheat and freeze/ shutdown.",1,32754

Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,9451,,,,,,,,I am not sure if you have identified the culprit for the crashes in your case?,1,32756
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,9451,,,,,,,,It could be a result of things like RAM incompatibility or PSU issues that cause the crashes.,1,32757
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,9452,,,,,,,,I believe it is a combination of plastic base and aluminum lid.,1,32758

Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,9452,,,,,,,,"GPU wise, I think its to be expected for a 15W APU.",1,32763
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,9452,,,,,,,,A dedicated graphic solution like a MX350 will always be more ideal.,1,32764
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,9452,,,,,,,,"But that may result in shorter battery life, and more heat.",1,32765
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,9452,,,,,,,,It also introduced some complication on my IdeaPad 5 where the HDMI don't work no matter what I do.,1,32766
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,9452,,,,,,,,I had to resort to using a USB type C to HDMI dongle to get the second screen to work.,1,32767

MAIBENBEN Laptops,9572,,,,,,,,"There will be no other big brands that can offer such a good value since this comes with a superior screen, SSD vs eMMC, and upgradable dual channel ram vs single channel soldered ram.",1,33151
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9573,,,,,,,,Is the version n4100 with mx250 at $536 worth it?,1,33152
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9573,,,,,,,,The ryzen with Vega8 is around 400 plus.,1,33153
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9573,,,,,,,,The screen bezel looks bad though.,1,33154
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9574,,,,,,,,Not worth.,1,33155
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9574,,,,,,,,"The CPU is too weak, so",1,33156
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9574,N,,,,,,,"even if you have a dedicated MX250, the performance is still going to be poor.",1,33157
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9574,,,,,,,,The CPU bottleneck will be very apparent in this case because you can only game a low resolution and graphic settings.,1,33158
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9574,,,,,,,,The Ryzen option is more attractive at this price point.,1,33159
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9575,,,,,,,,The n4100 with mx250 is worth it when it was selling for $360 dos version.,1,33160
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9575,,,,,,,,A few weeks ago they jack up to 500+,1,33161
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9575,,,,,,,,not worth anymore,1,33162
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9575,,,,,,,,The problem with the ryzen 2500u is that the idle power consumption is high and battery is 36wh which is very little.,1,33163
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9575,,,,,,,,You can expect 2-3h battery life only.,1,33164
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9575,,,,,,,,Of course if you dont intend to use as portable laptop,1,33165
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9575,,,,,,,,then it is a non-issue.,1,33166
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9575,P,,,,,,,"processor is slightly faster than intel 6th gen quad core, and faster than 8th gen Core i5-8250U",1,33167
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9576,,,,,,,P,"If it is 360, which is slightly higher in price than the version without the MX250, then I agree it may be worth it.",1,33168
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9576,,,,,,,,However don't expect good gaming performance on it still because of the severe bottleneck from the CPU.,1,33169
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9576,,,,,,,,"In addition, I am also concern about the cooling system since most laptops running N4100 have passive or minimal active cooling solution.",1,33170
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9576,,,,,,,,"If they use the same cooler with the MX250, it is gonna be very hot.",1,33171
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9576,,,,,,,,"The non Max Q MX250 draws 25W at load, vs 6W for the N4100.",1,33172
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9577,,,,,,,,So the $360,1,33173
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9577,,,,,,,,N4100 is the only one worth buying?,1,33174
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9577,,,,,,,,What's the estimated N4100 battery life for that base model?,1,33175
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9578,,,,,,,,i dont know battery size.,1,33176
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9578,,,,,,,,if assume worst case 36wh battery /7w cpu = 5h,1,33177
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9579,,,,,,,,It will be difficult to estimate without knowing the capacity of the battery.,1,33178
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9579,,,,,,,,"Generally, the N4100 is very frugal when it comes to power consumption.",1,33179
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9579,,,,,,,,"However if you add the MX250 in there, that changes the equation quite significantly.",1,33180
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9579,,,,,,,,"As pointed out earlier, the Max Q version of the MX250 should ideally draw 10W, though it draws more in practice.",1,33181
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9579,,,,,,,,The non Max Q version of the MX250 is expected to consume 25W as per specs.,1,33182
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9579,,,,,,,,"If it is only the N4100, I think the laptop will be passively cooled.",1,33183
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9579,,,,,,,,"But in this case, I don't think passive cooling is going to cut it.",1,33184
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9579,,,,,,,,"So if you further add an active cooling to the laptop, it will impact battery life further.",1,33185
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9580,,,,,,,,"From what it sounds, look like only the cheapest model at $337 is worth buying, pity only available in pink atm.",1,33186
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9581,,,,,,,,Don't get me wrong.,1,33187
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9581,,,,,,,,It really depends on what you are looking out for.,1,33188
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9581,,,,,,,,"The MX250 model, it is actually very attractively priced.",1,33189
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9581,,,,,,,P,"So if you think you want to have some light gaming, it may be a decent alternative.",1,33190
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9581,,,,,P,,,"If you are looking at just light usage and with an emphasis on battery life, then the version without the MX250 should address your needs better.",1,33191

MAIBENBEN Laptops,9589,,,,,,,A,Not really bothered by the bezel because the top and sides bezels are still slim.,1,33219
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9589,,,,,,,,It's only the bottom bezel that is thick,1,33220
MAIBENBEN Laptops,9589,,,,,,,,but that's due to the webcam placement and the logo.,1,33221
