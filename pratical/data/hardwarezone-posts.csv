Huawei Matebook 13,"Hi guys,
Was considering buying either a Huawei Matebook 13 or 14. Model and price as follows:
13/Intel Core-i5 8265U/8GB RAM/512GB SSD/MX250: 1160 SGD
13/AMD Ryzen 3500U/8GB RAM/512GB SSD/Vega 8 Graphics: 925 SGD
14/Intel Core-i7 8565U/8GB RAM/512GB SSD/MX250: 1550 SGD
Just need the ultrabook when travelling to check emails, surf net, basic microsoft office functions etc. More important is that the ultrabook is light and supports charging via the USB-C port.
Inclined to go for the 13/AMD Ryzen 3500U configuration since it's the most economical for my requirements.
Wondering if anyone has any thoughts or experience with the Huawei Matebook? Not sure if the XiaoMi Laptops would be comparable or better."
Huawei Matebook 13,"I'm also considering of getting Huawei laptop but I'm aiming at Matebook X Pro 2019 version.
Purpose of getting this laptop is to try on the Deepin Linux OS, doing some programming testing on Linux environment and at the same time trying If without Windows can I survive, just like without Google on my phone, can I survive.
But the price seems expensive for Matebook X Pro 2019 as I want the Ram configuration is 16gb."
Huawei Matebook 13,"I molested the Huawei 13 and 14 as well as the various Xiaomi when I was in china
Hands down I recommend the Huawei.
It's a 3:2 screen for starter. It's way more productive than a 16:9.
The Huawei screen is matte.
Typing in the Huawei is much better."
Huawei Matebook 13,Thanks for the input. Tempted to go with the Huawei Matebook 13
Huawei Matebook 13,any retailer selling locally or JB any store selling?
Huawei Matebook 13,It's available at the Huawei Store in JB City Square. Around S$1k for the 13 inch model.
Huawei Matebook 13,Matebook d looks interesting.
Huawei Matebook 13,Looks good enough to me.
Huawei Matebook 13,"looks yummy!
Anyone manage to see/try this in person yet?"
Huawei Matebook 13,New models
Huawei Matebook 13,"Previously can get Lenovo s540 with amd ryzen 7 for less than 900.. if look aroubd more probably still can get it for around that price, might as well get that. With top firing speakers some more."
Huawei Matebook 13,"Lenovo S540 only has 1x1 WiFi, 60% sRGB screen and cannot charge through power delivery..."
Huawei Matebook 13,"Last i checked, it was 2x2 WiFi. But yea, the screen is the downside. But lenovo qc/qa more reputable than huawei,imo."
Huawei Matebook 13,Finally coming here.
Huawei Matebook 13,"Faster adopt Renoir

Huawei Matebook 13,"Prices are cheaper in Malaysia. For matebook 13 difference is s$300.
For matebook d is s$250"
Huawei Matebook 13,"Thats 2019 model with 8gb ram. Their 2020 model is 16gb and 4500RM ~ 1500SGD. So only $100 more
IMO the 2019 model more worth it."
Huawei Matebook 13,Is the MateBook worth buying?
Huawei Matebook 13,Hows the new matebook specs to price? Anyone planning to buy?
Huawei Matebook 13,huawei windows licence can be renewed?
Huawei Matebook 13,"really tempted to buy this, got the design of apple but runs in windows."
Huawei Matebook 13,they removed all the goodies and continue selling at same price during the sale. What a scam

-
weighs 2.98 lbs 1.35 Kg........superlight ah"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Looking at the specs with Intel i9 and RTX 2060, you can expect this to be hot like a teppan yaki. In fact as they become slimmer, it will start resembling a hot plate indeed. Just flip it around and you can cook something there."

XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Quote
To handle the thermal load, Dell says it has included a ""unique"" thermal design to push more airflow throughout the system.
Unquote"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"So they say man. I am sure they will try and improve the cooling, but physically, there is only so much they can do. Because of the price, they may feature some vapour cooling solution on top of heatpipes to keep the machine cool. But if there is not much space for a decently sized heatsink to absorb the heat, heat will just continue to build up in the heatpipe and vapour chamber."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"A 17 inch laptop with a 15 inch body is large enough to accomodate better cooling system design lah
Quote
Advanced thermal design: The XPS 17 delivers unprecedented performance in an incredibly thin form factor. Optional discrete graphics feature unique dual opposite outlet fans, that increase fan airflow by approximately 30% and drive cooling airflow in both directions, resulting in more airflow overall and improved skin temperatures*. Dells development of the Dual Opposite Outlet fan has resulted in multiple pending patent applications and at least one issued patent. A massive vapor chamber spans the entire width of the laptop providing even more heat dissipation capacity to help keep the laptop cool and achieve higher turbo power.
Unquote"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"We can wait for the reviews to be out to determine.
I've used a 17 inch DTR before with a quad core Intel chip few years back. This is a chunky 3+ KG laptop with 2 fairly massive heatsinks. Back then, the power requirement on the Intel i7 3740qm are quite low under load despite the 22nm, and the chip already got very toasty, easily 85 deg to 90 degs @ a throttled clockspeed of around 2.5 to 2.7Ghz. Now the current Intel processor you know don't stay anywhere near the 45W TDP, so even without taking the GPU into consideration, it is likely struggling to cool it. Add the GPU into the laptop, the Max Q version of the RTX 2060 is spec to draw 65W."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Reviews of engineering samples here
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Very interested in the 17 inch model, finally they change to front firing speakers and 16:10 ratio screen. Guess it'll cost 3.5k> when it comes here?"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Likely to hit $4K or more if you get the max specs like
17 inch 4K UHD+ screen
Core i9-10885H 8 cores, 16MB cache CPU
Nvidia's GeForce RTX 2060 with 6GB of GDDR6 GPU
97WHr battery
64GB RAM
2TB NVMe SSD"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,The 17 inch is definitely the more interesting of the two
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Of course lah........big screen mah
I'm using the LG GARM 17 2020 and now NOT interested in anything smaller than a 17 inch screen leow"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,I think this is the one with a slower graphic card.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Whichever intel release, it is currently overshadowed by amd renoir series lol
I9 10885H with such a thin profile. The performance take a huge dip. With that said, the 4900H/S will take the crown instead and that should be the one to be fitted in a thin laptop instead as it isnt that power hungry."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Looking at the Tomshardware review, the lower spec XPS 15 is not managing the heat well. In the picture where they show 2 heatpipes across both CPU and GPU, its a goner when it comes to cooling. In the review, it was a GTX 1650Ti which is probably not as bad as having a RTX series in there. Where they mentioned sustained clockspeed, its 3.1Ghz, higher than the base, but clearly nowhere near the boost speed for Intel to beat AMD Renoir. Clock for clock, Intel will lag behind. I think the result is consistent that Intel don't have the luxury of having enough power or cooling for mobile, so will lose out to AMD Renoir which seems to sustain higher clockspeed due to the superior 7nm."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Exactly! Very hard to go thin with intel. They have a ferrari but with a coolant tank leaking. Good luck to them.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"I think I just want to clarify, I am not bashing Intel or thin laptops for no reason. In fact I am using an Intel Ice Lake base laptop. What I want to do is to make people aware that they are paying few grands few thousands for a laptop that is not performing as advertised. Sure, the up to 5+ Ghz sounds amazing, but the caveat is that if it can sustain closer to the boost and not the base, yes. I rather be realistic and look at the base clock to decide which one is the better solution. And as PC makers start selling you a new slimmer laptop, think thrice if you are looking for performance."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Think better to look at the bigger 17 inch for cooling performance
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Yeap. Is just that everyone needs to know about what intel is really doing. The fact that you put a high power consumption chip in a thin laptop. Chances are, it wont perform any good. Intel be it 9th or 10th gen. They are now behind in terms of fabrication. 14nm++ or 10nm vs 7nm on AMD Renoir.
It is clear that if you really wanna push Intel to 5Ghz, you need a LOT of power consumption. In such case, most Oem brands out there locked the Intel chip power consumption so that it doesnt overheat. And to further make sure it doesnt degrade performance further, they have to take extra measures to put more copper pipes. Which in this case, the dell xps isnt gonna cut it.
Just one look, the Asus Zephyrus G14. A 14inch laptop managed to perform really well with the 4900HS. It is not as thin as the XPS, but it managed to sustain boost clocks and eventually outperform the Intel i9 10885H. With lesser heat output and power consumptions, Asus managed to put it into the tiny chassis of the Zephyrus G14. To do that on Intel, you probably need a tank."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Generally, they will reuse the same cooling solution. Hopefully they improve on it though."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"What annoys me the most is these laptop manufacturer that charges you 3 to 4+ K boasting how slim the laptops are. Now what they don't tell you is that you get 50 to 60% of the performance that you should be expecting. If it is 4K for that, I would recommend you spend 3K on a mini ITX desktop, and remaining 1+K on a thin laptop with a U series processor instead. At least you still get 2 devices that serves their purpose much better than this."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Thought the bigger 17 is using some ""fancy"" vapor chamber cooling tech?
Razer also using it i think"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"A vapor chamber from my understanding please correct me if I am wrong is almost like a big and flat version of a heatpipe. Looking into an Xbox One X, I can see a big copper plate at the base of the chunky cooler, which I believe is a vapor chamber. Now for low power devices like phones, the vapor chamber can sort of spread the heat over a wide surface area to keep the SOC cool. In a hot device like a laptop or Xbox, you cannot run away from the fact it needs to transfer the heat to a heatsink so that the fan can blow the heat out of the case. With little space for the heatsink, the vapor chamber cannot create miracles. For something like the Intel processor itself, I suspect the vapor chamber can only delay the thermal throttle by a little longer than without it.  I believe even the XPS13 utilizes some fancy vapor chamber as well, but you can read the reviews/ comments on the thermals."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"but OEMs are not coming out good screen with AMD Renoir, that the problem."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"There is. Just whether you wanna find or not.
Asus Zephyrus G14 with Pantone certified. And the G15 is you need the rtx2060 and 240hz panel iirc"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Don't worry probably some diehard Intel supporting lurking around.
I owned the Intel i H series from Dell, in particular the Dell G3/G5.
The heat is unbearable during use, not to mention for G5 with RTX2060
top and bottom is really warm.
Using notebook cooler doesn't help to to cool the laptop that much.
Thus I sold away as I don't want to be cooking my own lap."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,ya man the new XPS 13 they say until got tiger got dragon end up its the hottest laptop I ever used...
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Si meh? Why you always put the XPS 13 on your laps to work or play games? Play games of course temperature will shoot up mah
But the below review said otherwise
Quote
What is super impressive, however, is that there is virtually no heat that transfers up to the keyboard or trackpad. Now, while the bottom of the trackpad does warm up quite a bit when it's working hard, the keyboard feels just as cool after 8 hours as it does when we first open the laptop up at the beginning of the day.
Unquote"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"I think this review gives you a better perspective of the cooling solution and the thermals of the XPS 13. You can see the cooling solution on page 1, and thermal results on page 3. The CPU is basically hitting 90 to 100 degs in performance mode, and throttled to 3 Ghz and below. Not to mention most of these reviews are performed with a very low ambient temp, i.e. air conditioned room or in cold environment."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Notebook coolers may be effective if there are more vents below. So says this review,
But most laptops provide limited vents below. Of course the downside of having more vents is that water might get in if you spill it on the table, not to mention it will get more dusty. The vents will also likely get blocked if someone uses it on the lap or bed."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"lol as usual singapore prices are a total joke.
how can the xps15 BASE model start at above 3000 sgd?
come on,they really just want people to buy directly from usa."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"That's why I was asking him whether he's always playing games on his laps. If gaming, and given such a small form factor as the XPS 13, then the temperature will definitely shoot up as expected."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"I've had an XPS 13 2-in-1  for about 6 months.
Since I needed 32 GB of ram, they only offered the 4K option.
Battery life is quite rubbish maybe 5-6 hours tops at normal usage, and it gets quite hot. But I love the weight and the fact that it supports active stylus."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Because US base model is an i5/8gb/256/iGPU. While ours starts at i7/16/512/1650ti
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Gaming wise, I am pretty sure people won't leave the laptop on their laps. Not just because it gets hot, but you need a mouse in most cases.
For productive work, it is possible it will be used on a lap. So if say someone is doing some video encoding, it is a possible scenario.
In any case, because of the slim form factor, it will not be able to keep the device cool. Based on my observation meddling with my E485 back then, the twin slim heatpipe became quite hot within a second even with light load. Under sustained load, the heatpipes get really hot and because the heatpipes are so close to the base, it is not ideal to leave the laptop on the lap. So nowadays, we can't call it a laptop anymore."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Let's hope dell does a decent job.. if not its really gonna be a white elephant.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"the specs are different no ah?
but max spec this is already nearly 4k...
can't imagine 17 inch one gonna be what price.."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,For 4K screen the battery life is always tough on the battery regardless of the laptop size. I believe in this case you chose 32GB RAM over battery life with 4K
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,4.5 to 5 K easily. I'll wait for Tiger Lake and see
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"I think there should only be Tiger Lake U coming in the later part of this year, which is capped at 4 cores improved CPU architecture and with Xe graphics on 10nm. Desktop version of Tiger Lake still runs on 14nm, which means there is a possibility that the 35W/45W chips may also be on 14nm."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Tiger Lake-H with 8C/16T would be nice just like the newly released Comet Lake-H in the DELL 15 & 17 2020 laptops
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"I have a feeling the H series will be based on 14nm. At this point, 10nm is clearly not ready for high power processors, i.e. anything more than 28W. The reason why I said this is based on observations. If 10nm is doing well, I don't see why they will backport Rocket Lake for desktop to 14nm. Also for the near future product stack, 10nm is always used only for the U series chips. Alder Lake will use 10nm, but rumored to have 8 big cores and 8 small cores, which is a regression from the current 10 big cores.
I am expecting good IPC gains from this new chip, but I suspect they lose too much clockspeed if they choose 10nm over 14nm, and therefore, regression in performance.
If that is the case, then this Tiger Lake H is going to run hot as well due to a highly clocked 14nm chip."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"not sure what you guys are on about

:
try doing the same config. its at least 200 $ more expensive in SG."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"By the way while typing this, I just figured out how confusing the naming conventions are. I feel there are too many Lakes around in the near future. Please forgive me is I get the name wrong."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"i'm pretty sure its due to the volume
Maybe wait for discount"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Just ask the CSO for discount... Usually can get 200 or 300 off
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"eh nowadays XPS not for gaming one, its business line model
The ORIGINAL XPS if anyone remembers. 4kg machine with 15"" screen, usd4k price tag 15 yrs ago!

If you want to game with dell, go alienware series. G series and inspiron lines have mid-range GFX, but don't expect good cooling.
TS, have you considered external GPU? You could have your cake and eat it! Easy upgrade, no overheating, and still keep the ultraportable LG."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"If buy eGPU then must buy large 32 inch 4K monitor to play games more shiok mah
Like I mentioned. Likely to go for Tiger Lake-H instead with TB4, PCIe 4.0 and USB 4.0 ah. LPDDR5 RAM will be unlikely because AMD not using it yet"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Very good piece of weapon to prevent killers and virus.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Does Dell XPS range if laptops have international warranty? Every now and then , eBay USA has some high spec laptops listed so could be chance to pick up a new XPS 15 cheaply."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,the newest 9300 already have refurbished at very attractive prices on the dell US store. how to order from there?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,wont the refurbished have worse battery life?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Dell warranty should be international. I picked up a laptop from them in Singapore. Went to Africa and it broke and the warranty still cover it.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Not for XPS. I transferred my US warranty to sg, and they only changed my faulty screen once out of good will."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Their terms keep changing. But afaik, only the those with Onsite warranty support are eligible eligible for transfer, not guaranteed covered. Those on 3yrs ProSupport should automatically be covered already.

Also keep an eye on SG refurbished outlet. Sometimes can have cancelled/returned stock.
XPS is an ultra premium consumer laptop that is also marketed to business. But for business, I'd rather support Latitudes than XPS. The BIOS and boot firmware in the XPS is trash."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,they flip flop like prata
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Dell warranty has been flip flopping around. Quite bad especially for international customers whom travels a lot.
Dont just say their laptop warranty lah. Their monitor warranty keep changing from 3 years to 5 years to 3 years. Then their budget monitor only 1 year."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,It was better when Michael Dell re-privatised the company. Now going downhill again after becoming public yet again.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,rooks good.. thanks for sharing
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"The new XPS 17 is now available on Dell online store, but only offered in 2 very basic configurations without the option to spec higher"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,just took delivery of the XPS 15 base model FHD
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Yeah. The RTX version will cost a leg and arm though

XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Huh? Qualcomm is Killer wifi just a gaming name in it.
Are you referring to Intel?"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Intel bought over Rivet Networks Killer lah

Qualcomm is Qualcomm"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Got to wait for review on the thermal. With RTX, xps gonna run hot. Xps 15 is already known for bad thermals.  Can wait and see how xps 17, with the new thermal vapour chamber can perform.
Power doesn't mean much. You can get i9 w xps 15 but it will throttle so much it doesn't make sense to get it."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,I got the 9560 model and I never had any issues with wifi connectivity even w killer wifi cards.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Amazing coming from Asus UX533. Wifey using it, so CPU performance itself is a welcome from Quad to 6 cores i7
FHD screen is bright and contrasty. Wonder how the 4K will look like in real life.
Compared to UX533 this trackpad is amazing. What issues do you face? So far not issues. Of course compared to my MBP15 windows trackpad gestures still a long way to go, but I am good with the XPS.
Bought Dbrands skins to protect the shiny case. Looted with 4 years accidental damage warranty, hope this last good until 2024"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,is there any shop selling xps17 with installments ? USA shop lets you do it but apparently not the SG shop
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Perhaps you should get a credit card. I recently bought XPS 13 and used 0% instalment via POSB EVERYDAY card.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Can get the DELL XPS 17 9700 2020 and pay for installments here.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"thanks
yea so apparently i would need a credit card for this...

any suggestions ?"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Sorry, the $3999 model comes with 4K touchscreen
10th Generation Intel® Core™ i7-10875H 16MB Cache, up to 5.1 GHz,

i think youre quoting the wrong post."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"The ad mentioned only on Selected Cc***
I recommend you just use those cards like Ocbc cashflo CC or Everyday POSB get 0% interest, process fee, straight instalment kind no bs"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"thanks im still considering because if i buy from Dell USA for Work website it costs like 400-600 Sgd less, higher config."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Any suggestion on how to ship from US to SG without costing an arm or a leg? Also thinking of buying from Dell USA for the RTX config.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Hmm I read on Reddit and YouTube a lot of people their touchpad is not aligned or is loose. So like you can press down but the click is not registered unless you press hard
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Dont bother. With shipping costs it will be more expensive. Cant even afford the current price
Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"use vpost, just dont declare its actual price and YOLO."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,The battery life of the 17 inch 4K running at 1080p is about 6hr only. If used at 4K battery sure about 4 hrs plus
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"yea personally i dont know what to do with the 4k display, it's even glossy.
much better then FHD that is also matte."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Can watch 4K movies lor. It comes with anti-reflective screen so should not be too bad.
Get the one with 8 cores and can run VM smoother by allocating more cores to the VM. You can even run Windows Sandbox in VM if you allocate 4 cores to it
😁"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Wonder if anyone kena caught before
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"If kena caught sure on front page of newspapers and pay until your pants drop
😁"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,tbh we just need a forum member whos coming back to sg from the USA and we're good.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"4k for 17"" makes sense.  At least more sense than 13 or 15 inch. I wonder how much more battery life you can get if you undervolt the cpu."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Ordered a XPS 15 9500 with the UHD+ 3840 x 2400 InfinityEdge Touch Anti-Reflective display option.  Thanks for the tip on Dbrand - just ordered the skin set.  Hope that it's easy to apply.
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Besides ordering from Dell SG online, are there other good venues that can offer good price for Dell laptops?"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"When ordering from Dell online, order through the CSO. I managed to secure a better deal."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,whats the CSO ?

XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Can get another 10% off?
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"what should i ask for ?
and how much would they shave off?"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Ask the CSO whether there are any deals available for the XPS15, and provide details of the exact specs that you are interested in."
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Yea try ask ask for freebies
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,"Buyer beware.
Note that the DELL XPS laptops do not support USB-C PD charging.
The proprieatry DELL USB power bank is able to charge it. However, note that it can only act as a 65W power source when used as a battery and a 90W power source in ""passthrough mode"" when the power bank itself is plugged into a power source.
Watch this review at the battery section"
XPS 15 and XPS 17 2020,Still one of the best power laptop this 2020.

Chromebook,"Hi all,
Im looking for a portable minimalistic device for web surfing, Google drive and web messengers telegram whatsapp. Heard about chromebooks, did some research an it's the kind of device I'm looking for.
However it seems like it's not available in Singapore. Where should I be looking at to get one for myself or to at least to get a hands on feel.
Models I'm looking at :
Dell chromebook 13 and Acer chromebook 14."
Chromebook,I am waiting for Samsung Chromebook Pro...
Chromebook,"Hi All,
Just wondering how many of you are have hear of them or are currently using them?
Personally I'm using one and feel that they're a great niche laptop that can help students or seniors to get familiar with the internet.
Currently the government has plans to use Chromebook for their plans.
Link
.
Also Android Play Store is slowing coming into existing and new Chromebook so the future is bright.
So what do you guys think?
Note: If anyone have any questions on Chromebooks please feel free to ask them here, I hope that this thread can be like one of the [official] thread.
Thanks."
Chromebook,"I am waiting to try on one, Samsung Chromebook Pro."
Chromebook,May be can list some advantages for newbies like me?
Chromebook,"@Wyvern8 Initial reviews are out, have you check them yet? Looks promising.
Hopefully Samsung will bring them here to SG Praying very hard.
@Bull Runnings Sure things, I'll list them down below Source:
Pros:
Price: The majority of Chromebooks cost significantly less than your average laptop. Chromebooks can be had for as little as $200 with mid-range models in the $300-400 range.
Speed: Chromebooks can power on and be ready to use in around eight seconds. They can do this because of their SSD hard drives and the lightweight Chrome OS.
Battery: Expect to get six hours or more from the battery on an average Chromebook. Some even claim as much as 13 hours. This is often more than you might get on a standard Windows laptops.
Sync: Chromebooks sync all your apps and passwords with Chrome browsers on other computers. So, if you use the Chrome browser at work, or on another home computer, your bookmarks and other preferences will automatically sync to your Chromebook.
Cloud Storage: You get 100GB of Google Drive storage free for two years with all new Chromebooks. This is a huge amount of space. Comparable service from Dropbox, OneDrive or Box would cost significant money.
Updates: Chromebooks update themselves silently, automatically, and in the background. So, your device is always up to date and works just the way you need it to which in turn helps with the security.
Weight: This varies, but most Chromebooks are lightweight devices that are portable and easy to carry with you when you need them.
Android Apps: Google have announced that you will soon be able to run Android apps on your Chromebook. This merging of Chrome OS and Android enhances the functionality of a Chromebook. It means you can use Android apps by Adobe, Microsoft and others to play games, create and edit files, or play music and movies.
Cons:
Office: If you are married to Microsoft Office products, a Chromebook is not for you. Google encourages you to use its own free online suite of Office-like services. Many of these services are comparable to components of Microsoft Office, but they do lack features that you may have come to rely on. Although you can use the Android version of Office apps, they lack some of the full functionality in their desktop equivalents.
Storage: Chromebooks typically only have 32GB of on-board storage. Limiting storage helps keep the price down because component costs are cheaper. Google wants you to store your data in the cloud, and that is why it often includes 100GB of online storage for free with new Chrombooks.
Printing: You can print on a Chromebook without too much difficulty, but depending on the printer you have, it might not be as easy as it used to be, because you are required to use Google Cloud Print.
Compatibility: There is no doubt about it. Windows is the most widely used desktop operating system in existence today. As such, you will find no shortage of apps and accessories to use with a Windows PC. A Chromebook can be more limited in this regard. It has a growing library of software applications, and can be used with a wide variety of accessories, but Windows machines still win in the battle for compatibility.
Hope this helps.
Thanks."
Chromebook,"Will check through
If you would like I can help you rename the thread to the [Official] Chromebook Thread or any naming that you would like"
Chromebook,"@Intrinion That'll be great. Thanks alot.
How about this Thread name: [Official] Chromebook SG"
Chromebook,"You are most welcome

Looks good on my end.
Let me know if you see the changes on your side.
On a side note, coincidentally, I was looking at the reviews of the Samsung Chromebook Pro over the weekends.
It's currently in beta phase & will be released probably Apr.
Looks promising with the included S-pen!
However some reviewers said that Android apps were unusable / stuttery at best.
What are your opinions on it?"
Chromebook,Oh... Samsung Chromebook Plus is available already. But I would hold for Samsung Chromebook Pro...
Chromebook,"Btw, where to get the chromebooks..? I mean I don't see them on retail.."
Chromebook,"Generally not sold in Singapore.
Courts used to sell them :O
Would have to be purchased online via Amazon / Ebay etc."
Chromebook,"@Intrinion Yup, as mention it's in beta hence not ready for the general usage.
From what i gathered it's the most likely due to different cpu that is used.
In general, most Chromebook is using x86/intel CPU chipset and most android is using ARM chipset. This led to the Android apps being optimised heavily on ARM processing.
Past Android devices running on Intel chipset has not received much positive feedback and led to manufacturer dropping the support for the chipset.
However if the merging of Chromebook and Android Play store I believe Google will step up the development of it.
There's few comments on the reddit thread that general usage of Android Apps is quite okay, what's is needed is to not set a high standard of expectation of it I.e. Running as smooth as an Android phone for now Especially games.
@Wyvern8 Sadly it's the same everywhere except US. Due to the low demand for the device everywhere it's quite hard to find them locally.
I did see ASUS selling their Chromebox/Chromebit Forget which one here in last year but it's not what I wanted and the specs is quite low lowest end model which result in less sales and then less incentive for companies to bring them in A vicious cycle.
With the government tender i hope it might pick up interest and pace.
Also another thing is that the Chromebook here are overpriced. The specs they've and the prices they've just don't match. I can get better deals on Amazon and with shipping it's sometime still better."
Chromebook,"Cuz of the profit margin that is why retailers don't carry Chromebooks.
However Education sector, some schools are using Chromebooks
for lessons already.
It has been a while already, if you guys really want comments about
Chromebooks can ask me also.
My past project was purchase of two carts of Chromebook
since they are cost effective
for students to do homework and do learning.
However not all environment permit full access to Playstore
featuers and items thus it is one major challenge.
The purchase was the Intel reference based chromebook.
Cost wise I cannot disclosed cuz consumer, education and
commercial pricing varies.

Yes there are local distributor for Chromebooks, however I am not sure
do they sell to consumer or not.
You can Google for them and send a email to them but they mainly sell to schools only.
Hope this hopes."
Chromebook,"i had a budget samsung chromebook the one using the arm chip way back and i think it's great for what it is a machine with just a browser..
the latest 2017 chromebooks look great though....especially with direct Play Store integration.
like many stated here...The Samsung Chromebook Pro and the Asus Chromebook Flip C302a are both i am currently scouting...
it's too bad that there are still no official news on these items being available officially in singapore with official warranty. the old samsung chromebook, i had to import from Amazon US"
Chromebook,"MS Office are now available via Android apps. Also, the online office apps via MS Onedrive is also sufficient enough. Unless you are truly power excel users that requires spreadsheets with tens of thousands of cells or weird plugins, i reckon most ppl can just work with these version of Office or even Google Drive Sheets."
Chromebook,"it make alot of sense for education sectors to use chromebook...
first they don't have to worry about security as chromebooks are locked down OS with just browser. Even the Android Apps are sandboxed and easy to manage...so the IT maintenance cost is minimise.
then there's the cost of licensing....for windows PC, the cost to license the OS, the different software antivirus, office, etc cost quite abit...those cost are pretty much gone if using chromebook
finally, chromebook are 'disposable' and cloud based...i.e....if the chromebook hardware is faulty and need a replacement, IT can just issue the user a new one and the user just need to login to his/her id and that's it...no need to do those re-imaging of OS, reconfiguration, domain security type of bullsh!t normally needed to deal with traditionally windows machines in corporate domain.
This is the reason why MS decided to release their own 'cloud-based' Windows 10
to combat Chromebooks and Chrome OS as the Education sectors in US and other smaller Asia countries has been adopting chromebooks at a faster rate that really eat into Microsoft's licensing margin."
Chromebook,https://www3.lenovo.com/sg/en/laptop...0GECTO1WWENSG0唔平！
Chromebook,"Not sure about MS but even if they have they always demand high price especially their license.
Google wise their platform are pretty much cost effective, about the asset management.
Primarily if you need to have a main Google account than you can manage all the asset, deploy software, manage users and etc. using the Google admin tool.
Unlike most asset management/deployment tool which need to be paid Google one is free but that is provided you have the cloud services or G suit in order to tap on such software."
Chromebook,"i would love to have the Chromebook Plus, with S Pen, and with LTE. totally no meaning if no LTE."
Chromebook,"it's good enough for my mother to surf net and watching youtube
productivity aspect damn cui, primarily lacking the MS word prog"
Chromebook,"Chrome OS is basically a gimped version of Gentoo with Coreboot instead of UEFI, soldered down components and a special build of the Chrome browser.
I get more productivity and the same kind of security out of my existing notebook running Fedora than Chrome OS."
Chromebook,the general users have no interest in running sudo or apt-get just to install stuff or keep the system up to date.
Chromebook,"As someone has pointed out above, the lenovo thinkpad 11e chromebook is for sale in SG!
I am currently using one as a secondary laptop and it's pretty usable for education or even as an entertainment device. It replaced my lenovo 100s windows 2gb ram which was laggy and has a bad tn panel. This has a IPS screen and great keyboard!
I agree with the pros and cons that was pointed out, especially the part where you can't use microsoft office. It wasn't a deal breaker for me as I adapted quite quickly to the google's own suite of apps. Personally I feel chrome OS will definitely be better once the play market is out for all chromebook. Thinking of replacing my surface pro 3 with the samsung chromebook as I take loads of handwritten notes.
<3 chromebooks"
Chromebook,"@techidiot Thank you for the information, i did a quick google and those company  does not seems to be bringing the latest Chromebook maybe due to cost or demand.
I highly doubt that Chromebook for consumer in SG will be seeing their lights anytime soon meaning getting from Amazon is still the most direct way.
@lordlad0 Same here, my Chromebooks ASUS & Dell had to be imported from Amazon because there's just no place selling them in SG.
2017 looks to be the year of Chromebook. Finger cross.
There's Office 365 if one needs the full power of MS suite.
Initial preview of MS Windows ""Cloud"" looks to be something similar to their previously shelf-ed Windows RT with upgraded features. I also hear that they aren't allowed to run any exe programs so if that's true then it's going to be a failure again just like RT.
They're banging heavily on their UWP Universal Windows Platform to compete with Chromebook.
@Ed.YEO Thank you for the link, I did came across that awhile ago but forgot about it.
The specs for this is not appealing to me at all, with that price I probably could get a better spec Chromebook from Amazon.
@G4 Agree with you that without any internet connection Chromebook would be quite useless outside of Wifi areas.
Hence comes need for Mifi, I personally use one of those and it's convenient to bring around I bought extra SIM card from my mobile.
I recommend this, it has a huge battery enough to charge a phone and it's not pricey as Huawei. Link:
@lunarsong You can use Google Suite for productivity but YMMY. Else there's Office 365 if you want to pay for something better.
TBH I find Google Suite just good enough for me to ditch Office all together.
@Rock-kun True that it's not as productive as other Linux distro but you can actually dual boot your Chromebook with Ubuntu.
It's called Crouton and it's quite interesting but I have no interest as of now to do it. Link:
ChromeOS alone is enough for me now.
@soupgoblin Great to hear your experiences with Chromebook. I actually use Chromebook more often than my rig. Usually once I reached home I'm too tired to play games Old man liao so I just watch youtube.
Personally I fear the build quality of ASUS as I have a ASUS C200MA that broke down only 6 months after I purchase it Battery died on me. There's a reddit thread on ASUS build quality awhile ago if many people sharing their bad experiences with their Chromebook.
It shook my confidences with them. Good thing is that local service centre can do a repair for me at a unreasonable cost.
I find that I have less reasons to buy any ""cheap"" laptop now with Chromebooks around."
Chromebook,"I have been using the Toshiba Chromebook 2 since late 2014 and just recently switched to the HP Chromebook 13.
ChromeOS is really fantastic for everyday use.  Really using it everyday.
I only turn on my windows PC once per month."
Chromebook,"Wow.. just curious, where do you purchase your Chromebook...? Tks..."
Chromebook,"the first one was from amazon and with free shipping
the second one using comgateway concierge service had to pay 5% service and sucky exchange rates all because hp.com usa won't accept overseas credit card"
Chromebook,"read on the [official] chromebook thread that lenovo chromebooks are available locally.  Never seen them myself, I got mine online - amazon and hp.com through comgateway"
Chromebook,"You can use Amazon Global to ship Chromebook directly, just that the selection might be a little.
Link:
FYI, Both ASUS C302 and Samsung Chromebook plus is on Amazon Global now."
Chromebook,"I bought Toshiba Chromebook 2014 in 2015 to use for university. Back then it was the only sub sgd $300 laptop with 1080p screen.
When I used it in school, everyone will comment
1 What notebook is it?
2 Google HAS AN OPERATING SYSTEM? SO COOL!
3 The screen looks nice!
4 You don't need charger meh?
... More prestigious owning a Mac!
What I liked about it is 10h battery life
Back then most people crouton + Wine to run windows program alongside chromeOS


If your chromebook is more powerful model, can also play games! For me only text based games or guild wars 1

adjusting crouton to look like Mac

In 2016 gallium OS was released! It is more stable than crouton and makes running windows 7 easy

I'm no longer updated about chromebooks. Some models support native windows 10. Eg acer 14/15 toshiba chromebook 2015, acer 720 etc
Just check here and see if Full Rom is available
If you are new and just want to use office, the microsoft office online works well. You can edit office documents by uploading to your dropbox, and selecting edit from chrome browser dropbox page.
Now the toshiba still working, I just use it to watch videos because of the nice 13 inch 1080p IPS LG screen

1080p video playback not a problem! It was an issue back then before hardware decoder existed"
Chromebook,"If you're buying a Chromebook to run Crouton + Wine, might as well just go for a generic notebook and slap a full-fledged Linux distribution on it.
And Nepgear <3"
Chromebook,can you get a 1080p laptop for under $300? back then you cant. even if you can now it wont have ips screen
Chromebook,Does the Thinkpad 11e support any stylus inputs?
Chromebook,"@yusoffb01 You're right, but you might have a hit on Carousell if you search and bargain.
@Intrinion According to this Lenovo site Link:
, There's a stylus for it."
Chromebook,"@intrinion @generalwu Mine came without the stylus but As what generalwu pointed out and I just found out there seem to be a stylus available for it, not sure if its good enough to jot notes on though. The touch screen is quite accurate!
Also to all owners, do check if your chromebook have the newest developer channel available, I just updated mine to that and playstore is available! Downloaded a few apps and made my chromebook even more useful"
Chromebook,"@soupgoblin Nah, mine didn't make it into the list of Play Store support. I'm using Dell Chromebook 11 2014 Version. Hence I'm looking into purchasing a new one.
Tempted to get C302 or Samsung Chromebook plus but the cost puts me down.
Now but next best option would be Acer C740 which has Play Store supported."
Chromebook,I have a habit where I keep more than 20 tabs open in chrome browser. Would Chromebook be able to handle that? I used to have an old i5 2nd gen laptop with 4gb ram I think which would slow down quite a bit when I do that.
Chromebook,You need to change your habit first
Chromebook,"so watching 1080P movies not an issue ?
need special software ?"
Chromebook,"@xolatw You can try this chrome extension Link:
@Swordsman Are you referring to gallium OS or ChromeOS?
With gallium OS you can download pretty much any player that supports Linux.
With ChromeOS you can try VLC App, but not so stable the last time I use.
Also the codec used in the video is important too. If using hard to decode stuff then the average Chromebook will slutter. Hence I always opt for fast processor Chromebook model."
Chromebook,"FYI.
Currently there's a sales going on at Amazon for Lenovo Chromebook 13
40% off, link:"
Chromebook,Just hoot! Thanks!
Chromebook,Goood price
Chromebook,How do you guys hoot? The seller dont have international shipping
Chromebook,"@xolatw Nice, direct or thru forwarder?
@blengend If i'm not wrong they've certain products that can be shipped directly from them. Link:
If not you can always use forwarders e.g. Ezbuy.
Create a account with the forwarder, use the forwarder's address in Amazon and ship your products to their location.
Once they've received your package, they'll notify you thru their portal which then you made payment to them and they'll ship your goods.
Hope this helps."
Chromebook,"i got 5 chromebook
1st one got from starhub contract
after that never look back
the 4 rest all hoot from amazonwhen there good deal
some models on amazon they will ship to spore with free shipping or paid shipping
the best chromebook i used til now is the Acer Chromebook 15, nice screen and feel fast
only thing is the 15'' size which too large for some people to carry around"
Chromebook,Used forwarder Haha. Seems like too good a deal not to buy
Chromebook,"Just hooted this. With FSSG, the ASUS C300SA is @ ~ 250sgd."
Chromebook,"That has a really shitty screen. wouldn't pay more than $200 for that. It has 20% bad reviews because it doesnt last 1 year. and Asus laptop isn't a premium brand. They break down easily compared to other brands.
You should have paid more and buy Acer 15!"
Chromebook,"@cannotliao Lol, 5 Chromebook? You're the boss liao. I only got 2 nia. My first one already from Amazon without international shipping. Didn't know back then we had Chromebook in SG.
My favourite Chromebook is my Dell Chromebook 11 2014 Version. It has >10K Octane Score which mean it's fast.
@xolatw gxgx, enjoy your hoot when it arrives, I'm sure you won't regret.
@eikooc Aww... That's not a really a good deal but nonetheless just enjoy it.
@yusoffb01 I agree that most common ASUS Chromebook has a bad rep with builds. My ASUS Chromebook's battery broke down on me with only months of usage.
There's a website that lists down all Chromebook and it's available specs.
Link:
I think it's very useful in choosing your Chromebook.
Hope this helps."
Chromebook,"@yusoffb01
Ah, good to know that! Thankfully, I managed to cancel the order before it ships.
How about this one then
?"
Chromebook,"@eikooc Check my last post, I have attached a link which have all launched Chromebook and its specs. This can help you locate the best Chromebook possible.
Also do you have a budget for your purchase? If so, what is the max before calculating the shipping cost.
Any specific requirement do you have for your Chromebook? Screen size?
Hope this helps."
Chromebook,"I think the next gen of chromebooks should be able to run android apps and preferable with touchscreen.
You may save money getting old models but lose out on performance and functionality Android apps are really useful"
Chromebook,"Anyone tried using blackboard collaborate on chromebooks?  Does it work?
I'm wondering since it can run android apps now, it might work? 😀"
Chromebook,"@jeffrey745 I've no idea, I do not use the app before. According to this website, it does not at least for the regular ones. Link:
The only way to know is to test it personally which I can't as my chromebook does not support apps."
Chromebook,"If I purchase Samsung chromebook plus from Amazon, can I charge it with my own 3 pin UK plug without frying it? Does the chromebook come with dual voltage/frequency capability?"
Chromebook,"Hi, Yup you can. Both of my Chromebooks are from Amazon and it's been fine since day one.
To be safe you'll need to check the label on the charger to see if it supports our voltage but to be fair most laptop chargers nowadays have support.
Refer to this site for a more detail explanation Link:
Cheers"
Chromebook,Wow thanks! The chromebook plus itself able to support 220-240v? I got 2 sets of chargers with usb type a to type c cables courtesy of note 7 exchanges. Can i use these chargers to charge the chromebook plus?
Chromebook,"Hi, I do not have the Samsung Chromebook Plus so I can't say for sure, but for my Chromebooks they do and I would assume they would do for Samsung Chromebook too.
Logically speaking, since laptops are made for travelling around the world it would be wise for the manufacturer to made that as an feature required for any product they sell.
I highly doubt those normal USB charger can power up your laptops. You would require something else that can provide more ampere & voltage for the Chromebook.
I would suggest that you can just bite the bullet.
Hope this helps."
Chromebook,"There's promotion on Amazon on Lenovo Chromebook 13 Link:
Again..."
Chromebook,Tempted
Chromebook,In general power adapters have a huge range. So it should work
Chromebook,can install windows 7 on this thing?
Chromebook,"Just do it, it's cheap.
@oriserzz Why would you want to do this? There're already cheap windows laptop around and you can even find cheaper ones in Carousel.
Anyway, I supposed you can do it just prepare a Windows 7 Bootable USB Drive and log into the bios of the Chromebook, change the boot sequence to USB first and then restart to try the installation. I have not tried it yet though."
Chromebook,"Not true, bought the above Asus laptop except with 2gb of ram at $170 1.5 years ago, battery life and etc still working fine.
Only gripe will only be the lousy screen quality."
Chromebook,Guess we all have different experiences with ASUS built quality.
Chromebook,Dell US Outlet has offer Link:
Chromebook,"all notebooks should support dual voltage/frequency already including the power adapter - I have used my chromebooks bought from amazon and hp.com locally and my local laptop in US.
Tried using my Nexus 6p USB C charger to charge my HP Chromebook 13 G1 - doesn't seem to work well, very slow.  Think the phone charger adapter capacity is not enough"
Chromebook,"FYI, Acer R11 Chromebook Refurbished on sale now @ Best Buy.
It has quite good review and has Android app support.
Link:"
Chromebook,Just come across Lenovo A12 on YouTube. It's an Android blown up size of the Yoga Book.. Anyone also eyeing..?
Chromebook,@Wyvern8 I'm only looking for ChromeOS so not for me.
Chromebook,"experimented with Win10 on my old chromebook. I will say dun bother. u need windows get a proper windows laptop.
The only thing stopping us is driver support. manufacturers dun bother to release win drivers for CB. there are third party ones written by others, but install them at ur own risk
If really need windows, then use a remote desktop connection to ur own windows PC lor.
90% of the time, at home, I dun need windows"
Chromebook,"I have the same CB too. still going strong.
u want better screen then u have to throw more $$ to get one with better screen."
Chromebook,"The Samsung Chromebook Plus looks goodplus a price drop of us$30.
Reviews are mixed.
Thinking of buying this or Samsung Tab S3 to replace my aging Ipad 2
Not too sure I am willing to take a risk on the warranty."
Chromebook,"Should try installing a full-fledged Linux distribution then. Since ChromeOS is basically Gentoo at its core, any recent Linux distribution should work with all its hardware out of the box."
Chromebook,"Buy from Amazon and not from vendors on Amazon.
This will ensure that they'll provide a good service.
So far I see is normal le, I would take a risk if I were on your position."
Chromebook,"Just saw the Straits Times articles on Chromebooks
and read that the HP Chromebook 13 are now available locally.  Went to HP SG website and saw that  the base Pentium model is $1049"
Chromebook,"Nice at least they're selling a decent one with android support. Link:
Better than nth I guess."
Chromebook,"Have been waiting to get Chromebook for quite a while and almost bought the HP Chromebook G1. However, I'd some reservation when I realised that it doesn't have a touch screen. What do you guys think of using Android apps with just keyboard alone?"
Chromebook,Some apps don't work well without touchscreen. Had to use the cursor keys to navigate the mouse pointer. Definitely not optimal.
Chromebook,Well if you haven't buy it yet then it's best to get one with touch screen as Android is heavily optimized for touch control.
Chromebook,"After owning Toshiba chromebook 2 since 2014 I decided to install windows!
TC2 only has 16gb emmc but it is possible to install. Also coolstar has developed drivers for most chromebooks so can install with everything working! hdmi. sound, wifi, graphics

steps are easy. just follow the instructions here
After installing windows 10, only had 2gb free. had to delete unnecessary files and use the built in compact.exe in windows 10.
Quite happy to have more than 50% disk space free. Everything working after using drivers from coolstar. Ram usage is around 800mb after boot.
So for around sgd $370 in 2014, I now have a windows 10 laptop with 1080p screen.
If you are interested to install, check the laptop compatibility list here:
Panasonic batteries still good after 3 years"
Chromebook,Too much unnecessary effort IMO. I will just slap an up-to-date Linux distribution on a Chromebook and not worry about drivers or insufficient storage.
Chromebook,Needs a bit more knowledge for you
Chromebook,"Lol, windows in Chromebook. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of a Chromebook?
Anyway, there's rumor of a Windows 'Chromebook' coming soon this year so we'll see how it goes."
Chromebook,"i don't see the point of a lightweight windows machine for any users other than the education sector...
the whole point of using windows is to run the win32 applications. If you can't run win32 application and only can run windows store UWP apps, then it is as good as the ARM version of windows which is pointless btw."
Chromebook,"Not for Windows yes, but Linux users are buying Chromebooks to run Linux on them.
Which is no surprise actually. Chrome OS is basically a modified Gentoo with an out-of-tree kernel. Because of this, there is a very high chance of all of a Chromebook's hardware working properly on any standard Linux distribution.
So you get a machine that is almost 100% compatible with Linux, and yet get a full-fledged desktop experience after putting a standard distribution on it without the space constraints. A basic install of most distributions can go as low as sub-4GB, and yet still come with just about everything that is needed to start working out of the box drivers, productivity suite, multimedia players, development tools, etc.
Even Linus Torvalds bought a Chromebook Pixel to install Linux on."
Chromebook,Is this some kind of a hack? Thought all along Chromebook cannot install files one? How do u manage to install win10 on it?
Chromebook,"steps are easy. just follow the instructions here
can be done in 1hour.

Chromebook,"I am using a samsung chromebook plus.
Using it for daugther school work, light surfing, light games...
It work very well. Speedy fast!
Screen to me is very important factor. And it is very sharp!"
Chromebook,"I just installed Windows 10 on my acer chromebook
Love it deep deep man!
The user below who said it takes 1 hr.
I took nearly one whole day hokay
Issue was with the Windows installation.
Got to say: the batt of this thing is incredible! Can last avg 5 to 6 hrs.
this is better than a tablet!"
Chromebook,"@aloskimo May I ask how and at what price did you get it? Thanks.
@aloskimo Hmm... so you think it's worth the effort to purchase a chromebook and convert it into a Windows laptop?"
Chromebook,you import from amazon?
Chromebook,Also want to ask same question as  lordlad0 mentioned..
Chromebook,"Lol, All of us asking same question.
I would think so too, but I don't know how to calculate the GST if I were to buy from amazon though.
Anyone know?
Thanks."
Chromebook,"just checked at Amazon page ,should be around US$30.10/SG$42.18 because item is more than SG$400. Confirm attracts GST.

Chromebook,"GuyS, AMazon got one Samsung chromebook 3 11"", 16Gb hdd, usd179, got fssg. You keen anot? Or too cheapo for y'all liao?"
Chromebook,"Last time it was carried by Courts.
I remember saw some of the chromebook, but recently i want to buy one and found out storewide don't have chromebook anymore. WTF!!"
Chromebook,Chromebook is low budget item and not much profit margin I guess.
Chromebook,"5GB Windows 10 Pro 64bit v1703 install + 1.5GB microsoft office, inside a 16GB hard drive"
Chromebook,"Do anyone knows where can I do a repair for my Chromebook?
My Chromebook cannot detect my battery."
Chromebook,"Aww. D:
Parts should be hard to get from Simlim.
Hmm. Is it a battery fault? Your best bet would be parts from Amazon and self replace."
Chromebook,"Try to Google for :
1. Any online tech support forum for your Chromebook model, or
2. Search for diagnostic tool to aid the trouble-shooting. Maybe it's just a software configuration.
Also do check out Amazon on your particular model or similar models from the same maker. Sometimes the model's review section may provide some clues, or you could include your review & this battery issue you have. Some Chromebook experts may respond with their solutions.
As for SLS, can forget it as these people are just interested in selling machines with fat margins.
Can search YouTube, iFixit & other similar tech repair websites for solutions. But first of all, do check out its user manual for troubleshooting tips & any online references, support forum, email support availability etc."
Chromebook,"Sad, after looking around I think the most likely scenario would be a mothboard failure According to this source:
The cost of replacing the motherboard are around US$110++, which I think is not economical Link:
.
Guess I'll have to used it with power plugged in No longer portable."
Chromebook,"for battery problem, just unplug the battery wait a while and reinsert
if someone has similar model can try your battery on their laptop"
Chromebook,"Yes. Remove the battery, clean up the battery contacts, then re-install it back. But do make sure the machine is isolated from the mains, during this operation. Unplug the power adapter too. Good luck bro.."
Chromebook,"Chromebook batteries normally not removable, unless u remove the casing. See can download the service manual to guide the removal"
Chromebook,HN has HP chromebook at $200+ and 1+4 yrs EW is $108.
Chromebook,"Which HN is this? I am trying to find a demo set for Asus C202SA but I've not come across any shop in Singapore that sells this.
I guess it is almost impossible to find physical shops that carry a wide selection of chromebooks in SG."
Chromebook,"Is it the blue colour one HP stream 11"" for $299? That one ish not a Chromebook, it's in Win10 and has 64Gb hdd"
Chromebook,HN at square 2 has HP chromebook.  I intend to buy in December.  Can call them to ask.
Chromebook,"Just to update, HP Chromebook 11 G5 is available at HN square 2 at $399, 1+4 yr extended warranty at $108.  Now 1 new set only."
Chromebook,"Might be old version of C-book. Or old stock, beware!
My minimum display size at 14"" so this one is no go. Thanks for updating us HN."
Chromebook,I think 11 is too small and waiting for 14 to drop price. Can get from HP online store.
Chromebook,"Yes, if you get 11"" C-book, you'll need to connect an external monitor for extended usage, otherwise your eyes will be under heavy strain.
If Google don't move fast enough, they might lose out to the up & coming Windows 10S, Microsoft's version of Chrome OS, although it's rather unlikely this stripped down version of Windows 10 would be capable of built-in antivirus protection & seamless, hassle-free updates."
Chromebook,"Chromebooks in SG are way overpriced.
I rather get it from Amazon Especially for their open-box sets.
I actually preferred to use 11"" for portability, 14"" is just too big to bring out.
TBH, if they're going with UWP and the Window store then I might give it a pass.
Later become the next Surface RT."
Chromebook,"Can buy from Malaysia, right? With one year international warranty.
By the way, Seiko watch bought in Malaysia is also covered by Singapore warranty."
Chromebook,"I think there is still an appeal for Cbooks.
The 10S imo is basically a restricted version of Windows limited by software restricted by a license. Hardware wise if it comes with X86 /non arm components  it is more than capable of running software out of the Windows store.
But it's restriction is restrictive and unless imo is properly priced ..and strictly enforced by partner OEMs, will be a white elephant.
Take for instance a Lenovo 100S or Asus H200A - these with full fledged windows are priced attractively already."
Chromebook,"Do anyone know how well does windows 10 perform in low-end processors?
Last I heard they're sluggish and barely usable."
Chromebook,"If you are patient, then it is ok..."
Chromebook,"@sendtolee Lol, if that's the case then never mind, Intel m3/i3 would be my bare min.
In fact for Chromebook the N processor's are not smooth enough for me, min U processor or m3/i3 processor."
Chromebook,"When I use linkedin on both chrome and firefox with no other tabs and programs opened, it will be real slow and the cpu utilization will jump up. The cpu utilization is also reflective of the slowness of the built-in graphics cpu.
Opening and closing program is fast using ssd. But running a subroutine inside program is slow.
Hope this helps."
Chromebook,"Reviews on Surface 3 Atom r generally positive. For productivity like office it will do well. It's also fanless. Of cos if u do heavy stuff like rendering n gaming, it's another story"
Chromebook,"Pretty good on a Core Atom Z3775

Useable on all accounts. Not too many tabs owing to corresponding low amount of ram.

According to a YouTube who used to be a former Microsoft team lead.
10 is actually very polished and optimised compared to say 7. Hur hur"
Chromebook,"I have 3 low powered machines running windows 10
1 A low powered 15w desktop with n3150, 4GB Ram 120GB SSD, 4TB HDD, using it to download terrabytes of videos, remuxing mkv and uploading to google drive. It has SSD so the slowness is not felt. I can remux mkv, surf the net using firefox and play videos using hardware encoder simultaneously.
2 A windows tablet 1w on 50% brightness with intel z8300, 2GB RAM and 32GB EMMC. I can surf web and use office at the same time. I use this as a PSP emulator using PPSSPP and also watch videos in train. Also use this for quick photoshop or editing pdf using Acrobat X.
3 The toshiba chromebook 7w typical usage with n2840 previous gen of n3150 and 16GB EMMC. I previously used this for typing notes in uni. The video hardware encoder is not as good as n3150/z8300 so it is laggy when surfing firefox if you watch video. However for note taking/office and surfing the net it has no problem.
All these low powered devices work well with windows 10 after you disable unnecessary services eg tablet PC, disable hibernate, disable system restore, disable windows security center, disable windows defender. For example for my chromebook, I have 400MB ram usage on first bootup. Also use firefox instead of chrome
What will be your usage? You may not need to buy i3 after you trim windows 10 first. For newer low powered processors, there is n3450 n3150 replacement with 10 bit 4k HEVC decoder, z8350 slilght speed bump for z8300, n4200 N3700 replacement with 10bit 4k hevc, core m3-7Y30 M3-6Y30  replacement.
The performance ranking based on CPU performance is
m3-7Y30 > M3-6Y30 > N4200 > z8750/z8700 > N3700 / N3450 > N3150 >Z8350/Z8300
Hardware encoder is very important so that video playback will be smooth.
Atom z3775/n2840 are no go for hevc, but since you cant buy anymore it doesnt matter.
For most plebs, z8300/n3150/n3700/M3-6Y30 are sufficient for up to 4k 8 bit 30 fps HEVC h265 / AVC h264.
The best is if you buy m3-7Y30/N4200/N3450 for that 4k 10bit 60 fps HEVC videos"
Chromebook,Which is the cheapest locally available one having M3-7Y30 ?
Chromebook,"Great information you've shared here, thanks.
I'll not look down on low-end processor anymore."
Chromebook,"Hi all, I am intending to buy a chromebook, from some reading, it seems that buying from Amazon is the best option. Anything do I need to take note of when selecting one?
- Voltage?
- Plug? Most likely is US Plug I suppose
Anyone bought before via services like ezbuy?"
Chromebook,Voltage no problem. Plug will be US 2 pin. Just use adaptor
Chromebook,"@harux89 Actually Amazon does ships to SG thru their AmazonGlobal service and there's lots of Chromebook under the service.
Try this link:"
Chromebook,"A sad day, my Chromebook can no longer boot up and has a burned smell after a while.
Do you guys recon it can be fixed in SG?
Thanks."
Chromebook,"I am confused about this actually. Is that definitive list?
Question is because in the item list, I see item A and Amazon says that it is ""Eligible for shipping to Singapore"", but when I go into the actual product page, it says ""This item does not ship to Singapore, Singapore. Please check other sellers who may ship internationally."" wheres the Price still says ""$XXX.XX + No Import Fees Deposit & FREE Shipping to Singapore""
Anyways, I already pulled the trigger on ASUS C300SA. Really budget model.. just intending to do some html/css/javascript via sublime on crouton."
Chromebook,"Or you can just put a recent Linux distribution on the Chromebook and completely not have to worry about performance, y'know?
I have Fedora 23 running on a 9 year old Acer with only 2GB of memory with all the eye candy and animations turned on and that thing flies, even with a mightly slow 5400rpm HDD and the processor throttled to 525MHz. And you still get the full desktop experience with all manner of desktop applications."
Chromebook,"Anyone got the Samsung Chromebook Pro? Thinking of upgrading, currently using Acer Chromebook 14."
Chromebook,"Greetings Experts
I need to buy a Chromebook for my sister who is in JC.
Please advise.
1 Typical usage, Web surfing, Google Documents. Limited video. NO GAME.
2 Since used  for school work, internet may not be available all time. so offline storage of at least 50GB is required.Now a days all Chromebook do not have offline large capacity storage. What are the options?
2.a Can I buy 250 GB Micro SD /SD and slot in?
2.b Is the performance is transparent?
2.c Is the Usability Access easy and convenient with Micro-SD?
2.d Can the google drive sync automatically with SD Card?
2.e Any other option
3 What is the minimum RAM Size I should select for decent performance?
4 11.x"" display seems small. sometime students share screen and discuss.Prefer 13.x size display
5 Better to buy Amazon.com or locally any suggestion? Any school store?
6 What is the processor I should choose?
7 Any other limitation I should be aware?
8 Should I buy now or Wait till next computer  exhibition? I am not in hurry.
Thank you"
Chromebook,Suggest you get a standard notebook PC.
Chromebook,"I used a chromebook in uni. Not recommended for a tech-idiot. Google's office suite lacks a lot. You can use dropbox+ edit online via office 365 online. But need wifi to do so and if you're offline can't save. Even online office 365 sometimes feel laggy.
Before windows came to my chromebook, I had to install linux to use office 2010. Even then its troublesome and I had to reinstall linux a few times.
Long story short, just get a cheap windows 10 laptop. Acer ones being sold at NTUC cost like $350 onwards which is reasonable. Alternatively you can buy at lazada acer offical online store. Currently you can get $60 credits if you pay via fuzzie app.
Buying a windows 10 laptop from manufacturers come with lots of bloatware and a lot of unnecessary processes running. People get sick of their cheap laptops running slow. But if you take the time to read up on how to disable these things, windows 10 runs as well as windows 7.
Take note that cheap laptops that comes with 32gb or 64gb storage do not have SATA, so you can't upgrade the hard drive. Buying a high capacity sd card looks good on paper, but not practical. Sometimes the built in SD card reader gets disconnected and you need to reinsert a few times to get it working again. You're better off with a microsd card reader+micro sd card.
Yes 11 inch is too small. You cannot open pdf+word document side by side and read it comfortably.
As for processor, when youre at the store, google the processor and make sure its quad core."
Chromebook,What budget are you planning?
Chromebook,Saw someone selling Dell Latitude E5250 for $450 on HWZ forums.
Chromebook,latest quadcore n3450 and 4gb ram for $399 at jurong point ntuc
Chromebook,"@catherineteosg As the others have mention, it's best that you buy a standard laptop for your sister, she might not be able to get used to it.
A second hand laptop from Carousel can be considered if you're tight on budget.
Hope this helps."
Chromebook,"FYI, Chromebook sales on Amazon Prime day Link:
."
Chromebook,This is an Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C0GD.. anybody got this laptop?
Chromebook,Just to let you know the keyboard is not comfortable to type and the layout is not the standard type. The battery quality is very poor as it will not be able to charge after 1 year. This is my experience and it may be different from yours.
Chromebook,"I  came across  the budget Chromebook with 4GB Ram, 32GB flash, SD card.
The  processor  is   Processor: Rockchip RK3288 Cortex A17 processor
compare  with
which one is better?
- In terms of Processor
-In terms of performance."
Chromebook,intel is better
Chromebook,"I agree x 2.
My Chromebook had a dead battery and recently I found a company doing repair for Chromebook.
Being naive I went to seek their advice and had a bill shock.
They're called technofied pte ltd Link:
Consultation alone cost $100 Being called as deposit.
Then they quoted me for motherboard and battery replacement of $390.
I can buy a new Chromebook for that amount.
Learn my lesson the hard way."
Chromebook,"This is a new model.. was urs the earlier Aspire 1 A114-31-C5Z2? ---
The keyboard is actually quite nice to type with leh but the laptop seems a bit laggy.. those of u who have it.. does it oso feel laggy to u?"
Chromebook,"I know many people are trying to buy the chromebook from Amazon and use it in Singapore, do you guys have any concern in term of warranty, is it an international warranty? What can I do in Singapore if the chromebook fail within the warranty period?
thanks."
Chromebook,buy another one
Chromebook,Buy a new one
Chromebook,"I am wondering is it what a buyer will do, -> buy item from Amazon, if it is faulty just buy another new 1?
But the Samsung chromebook pro I planning to purchase is around s$800, will be very risky if can't repair and no warranty in singapore"
Chromebook,$800 can buy a brand new i5 notebook in Singapore.
Chromebook,"$800 for an i5 notebook probaby gets you a thick cheaply built laptop, thick bezels, max 1080p display and no touch screen.
On the other hand the Samsung Chromebook Pro is a thin and light 2-in-1 device, well built and with a bright 1440p display. It also has a built in pen as a bonus.
It really depends on usage, if you are just surfing the net, reading emails, watching videos the Chromebook is more than capable. If you need full programs like Photoshop, Microsoft office etc. then you should consider others instead."
Chromebook,"$800 is for $800 specs.
Haha...$800 for chromebook?"
Chromebook,"As I said build quality is vastly different and you get a way better screen. Some people don't need full windows programs and the Chromebook is a pretty good fit. Not to mention battery life, Chromebooks have easily 8+ hours, I'll be surprised if a $800 laptop lasts more than 6."
Chromebook,No thanks to a $800 chromebook. Rather spend $800 on tablet.
Chromebook,"Samsung chromebook pro is a 2-in-1 which means it can be used as a tablet as well with full andriod apps
but yeah at the end of the day it comes down to preference."
Chromebook,"$800 for my hp chromebook 13 ... totally worth it, imho"
Chromebook,Anyone bought the Samsung Chromebook Pro?  Can share your experience?
Chromebook,"Here is my quick review of my Samsung Chromebook Plus which i brought from Amazonfirst time.
Order and Delivery
I had ordered the item on 28th June.Item was shipped on 30th June.
Supposed to receive on 12th July. Received item on 8th July 17.
Was surprised when it came early. Good job to Amazon and the delivery side.
Positive Points
- Interface was simple and neat.
- Chrome was able to support most the daily stuff workloadinternet surfing,fb,open pdf and watch video online
- MicroSD card support
- Beautiful screen
- 3 ways of input Pen, Trackpad or USB C mousebuy your own. You will use the pen more trust me
- Many ways to use device Normal laptop/Tent/Tablet mode depending your need for keyboard usage.
- last 7 to 5 hours on a full charge with wifi on only and screen 35% brightness. You don't need 100% brightness.
- There is a build in video player, gallery viewer and file viewer.
- Portable and light.
Not so Positive Points
- 1080 videos not streaming ones will still play but with interlace issue. No playback issues for 720 videos. Used VLC player.
- Need a 2pin to 3pin travel adapter.
- Andriod apps can be used,but need further polishing. There should be more improvement once it is updated to 7.0 version.
- No warranty in Singapore so it is a risk if you intend to buy.
- Devices need USB C port. Troublesome for now. Should have no problem when more USB C devices is been released.
Conclusion
- Suitable for those intend to bring around for daily surfing and casual andriod usage.
- Very pleased with purchase.
Hope the above helps with those looking at this model."
Chromebook,"I also bought the Samsung Chromebook Pro from Amazon.  So far, very pleased because :
1. Very colourful and vibrant high resolution screen, as good as the Dell XPS 13 or 15 QHD screen
2. Very use-able 3:2 aspect ratio screen, although 12.3 inch screen, feels as good as a 14 inch screen with similar height too wide is wasted if you are not watching video
3. Very versatile with 360 hinge, I use it in all 3 modes - laptop mode, tablet mode biggest tabletand a reversed laptop keyboard facing down on the table.  360 is not very effective if the device is too big or too heavy.  This is just nice at about 1 kg.
4.  Very fast boot up 7 sec and shutdown 3 sec.  Unlike tablet, can afford to shutdown and boot up every time.
5.  Very good battery life of at least 8 hours or more.
6.  Performance is very good.  No problem opening more than 10 chrome browser tabs.  Unlike Android table, videos eg. Youtube on one tab will continue to run even when you switch to other tab.
Some limitations now
1. Some android apps cannot be resized to full screen and some cannot be run.  Some apps doesn't present a scroll bar when you need to scroll, you need to use your finger to touch and scroll.
2.  The Micro SD card can only be accessed thru' the inbuilt File Manager.  Android apps that you download from Google Play Store seems to be not aware of the card you only see internal storage folders.
3.  Keyboard is not the standard windows layout.  There is no cap lock search button in place and no delete but only backspace button need to use Alt backspace.
Probably would not buy any more Android tablet but Chromebook.  Don't have to worry about battery draining when not use, whether to buy a keyboard case or tablet stand or not, whether 10 inch is too small or not etc."
Chromebook,Reviews are very helpful! Did you guys use any promo code when buying from Amazon?
Chromebook,since when does amazon has promo code...lmao
Chromebook,There is a US$50 discount on Chromebook Pro now.
Chromebook,"去HP官网買架HP 14寸Chromebook,俾加$79買個三年保修配套,唔駛$800"
Chromebook,"I have purchased new SAMSUNG Chromebook 3. it came with 4 GB RAM, 32 GB HDD. I am planning to use this for my business and I need to access my files at clients meeting where often I may not have internet access.So my Google drive files needs to be offline so that I can use then even without internet access. Since I have more than 30 GB files, I have purchased 256 GB Micro SD card.
1 How do I move my 30GB files to 256GB Micro SD card and sync with Google drive  in  Chromebook.?
2 Since no security for Micro SD card, if someone steal micro SD card my files will be easily available. Anyway I can encrypt and protect.Thanks
Thanks"
Chromebook,Anyone knows if Dell is going to announce another Chromebook soon? Any rumors? The last one they released was in 2015.
Chromebook,What do you guys think of the Pixelbook?
Chromebook,way too expensive.
Chromebook,"Reminds me to look back at Samsung Chromebook Pro instead..
Still feels its over-priced, cant accept the pricing Google set for this set. Maybe its my perception that Chromebook function is still less as compares to a standard Window laptop or maybe a MacBook.."
Chromebook,I also feel it's overpriced. Just like the new Pixel phones
Chromebook,"Hi, how much did you pay for your samsung chromebook pro?
Currently here is the checkout price on Amazon:
Items: USD 497.00
Shipping & handling: USD 42.90
Total before tax: USD 539.90
Estimated tax to be collected: USD 0.00
Import Fees Deposit: USD 37.79
Order total: USD 577.69
The import fees deposit is GST?"
Chromebook,"I too feels it's just too much, how I missed the Nexus's days."
Chromebook,anyone knows if a chromebook is the best option for me? planning to major in stats in uni but idk if a chromebook is sufficient
Chromebook,"But somehow chromebooks loo not so ""nice"""
Chromebook,You need to use SPSS which cb cant run
Chromebook,"hmm what if i use the PSPP alternative on linux, or is that overdoing it"
Chromebook,Not detachable like what was said in the report so let's wait for this
Chromebook,"Mine was SGD$700 after currency conversion and via VPOST excluding GST SGD$60 plus shipping SGD$40
Thats a whopping $800 for a spanking new Chromebook Pro from amazon"
Chromebook,How is the experience? Was it worth it?
Chromebook,"thinking of getting the pixelbook too.. but google is like apple.. paying huge price for their products.. especially for pixel products T.T
miss those nexus days.. pricing good and good specs too.."
Chromebook,"Price aside... Even if I were to get, where should I get the pixelbook...? Amazon..?"
Chromebook,"Here you go, from Amazon link:"
Chromebook,"Thinking of snagging a Pixelbook as well.
Not to run ChromeOS, but to wipe it off and put Fedora, Mageia or Debian Buster once it attains package freeze status on it.
Partly because I have never tried playing with Coreboot. Anyone knows if a Linux distribution can boot with a Coreboot + Tianocore payload? Don't want to use SeaBIOS since a new machine should be using UEFI boot and not legacy boot."
Chromebook,i also interested for a pixelbook but the price most definitely pushed me away.
Chromebook,"Anyone got the Asus c302? How is it?
Sent from Huawei NEXUS 6P using GAGT"
Chromebook,its either Pixelbook or samsung chromebook pro !!
Chromebook,"Btw, I am just curious... Is there any price difference if I were to get from Google store or Amazon...?
I am not sure if there is any difference. It will be my first if I decide to get a pixel book..."
Chromebook,"Hi Guys,
Would like to check for such refurbished units, in your opinion is it safe to purchase?
Main use for laptop:
Youtube
Do some google doc work
Emails"
Chromebook,"I recently snapped up a used Acer r11 on carousell.. loving the experience of a Chromebook now.. but I still bring my 1hr battery life 2009 MacBook pro cos im worried if i have to do heavier stuff.
I bought this to test the usability of chromebooks and whether there is a future for me to use the pixelbook and I would say I'm impressed but I'm also just a 3 day old user.. oh, battery life is amazing.
Sent from Huawei NEXUS 6P using GAGT"
Chromebook,"Saw alot of YouTube clips on review and unboxing of Google pixel book. Any one here have ordered Google pixel book..? And which config you guys getting, also you guys also got the Pixel book pen..?"
Chromebook,"I'm not very sure but I think the price differences will be little since it's a ""Pixel"" we're talking about Google Pixel = best/latest/expensive.
For warranty wise I'm not sure if either will honor it or not. That's the risk of buying overseas.
To me it's not worth getting it as you're mainly paying for the ""Pixel"" branding. You can achieve more by getting the other Chromebook like Samsung Chromebook Pro cost close to half of Pixel.
Just my 2 cents."
Chromebook,"I would prefer to buy reburbished/used unit from Amazon warehouse as it's easier for me. Remember to check who's the exact seller, my used Chromebook had a defect battery which I used for a few month before it died.
Nice, may I asked how much did you paid for it? Want to know the market rates.
Thanks."
Chromebook,I managed to get it at 300. No warranty. And no 100gb Google drive cos he already redeemed it.
Chromebook,"I do agree with you. I have seen the Youtubers review on Google Pixel Book and they also commented that its actually not worth to fork out such a price to get an equally capable laptop or chromebook as there are many such option available.
Kind of disappointed that google, Microsoft priced their hardware so high."
Chromebook,Can check with bros here using Chromebook if able to install chrome extension like shopback etc similar to using chrome on a windows notebook?
Chromebook,the samsung chromebook pro only 16gb? if put a 64gb card will the system recognise and combine the storages?
Chromebook,"That's a little high, I think I can get a new one from Amazon below USD$400 but at least you get to used it straight away.
No choice, seeing the success of Apple with their branding, they're just following thru too.
Building their own branding in hopes to topple Apple.
Yup it can, it's a browser OS.
No I don't think so, it's not even able to store android apps on SD card yet if I'm not wrong."
Chromebook,"if like that 16gb where got enough T.T
pixelbook got 128gb and 256gb but cost the same as windows 10 laptop..
suddenly i feel pixelbook isnt actually overpriced.. its specs is top notch.. i5 with 128/256gb.. which should cost as much as a regular laptop already.. is just its installed with chrome os thats why most people feel the price should drop..
chrome vs windows os i think chrome has the losing edge in terms of capability..
that said.. besides its OS, specs wise, build quality wise, and aesthetically wise.. pixelbook pretty awesome.. =x might get the base model or top up about 300 more for more storage..
hopefully amazon comes out with some sale or what..
might get it for birthday or christmas present for myself xD"
Chromebook,"Bought a Acer R11 some months back during amazon price drop for my kid to do her moe elearning homework.
Like the full-size keyboard without the number pad. The white exterior, black keys, very sleek and modern but can get dirty if you have dirty fingers. The laptop is heavier than expected at 1.3kg, probably due to the touch screen.
Surprise that Android apps on the Google Play Store is available on this chromebook, therefore you don't have to rely solely on the Chrome browser to access apps. Installed kodi and android games, works pretty well.
Playing marvel future fight is smooth, but too huge for the touch screen control and heavy if you intend to game for long for those actions control games.
Connect from hdmi to my 65"" xiaomi tv is smooth, but can only support HD resolution and cannot display full HD. I had yet to try chomecast. The trackpad is not as responsive so I bought a wireless mouse, which paired perfectly.
Overall it is still a good buy for a chromebook that is flipbook with touch screen.
On the last note, I realized that the mconline.sg my kid elearning portal still have some flash application, so still have to go back to windows for the occasionally usage, otherwise it is a superb laptop with almost 9 hrs of usage time on battery."
Chromebook,"Can buy other brand one, pixel is just overpriced.
Awaiting for black friday sales, it's on sales on Best Buy for USD$179.90 during Black Friday."

Chromebook,"I don't have a Chromebook to test, but as a Linux user I can safely tell you not to expect anything beyond barebones functionality for Linux on recent hardware until at least half a year later for the kinks to work out. WiFi and native resolution may work, but that's about it.
Case in point; the trackpad on my laptop still does not work on Linux after one year, even after compiling and installing the latest mainline kernel."
Chromebook,"anyone has the Samsung Chromebook Pro to share their experience?
Thanks"
Chromebook,"anyone has a pixel book for sale? Using Samsung Chromebook pro now, wanna try the other  side
pm me if you have one. Thanks!"
Chromebook,"Hi,
May I check what's the warranty like if you were purchased chromebook from amazon?
There seems to have limited choice in Singapore."
Chromebook,"Hi! I don't have a Pixelbook, but I do have an extra latest Acer Chromebook 15 CB515. Completely BNIB and am selling slightly below retail. Should you have any interest, lemme know! Cheers"
Chromebook,"Hi all! I have an extra CB515 the latest Acer Chromebook 15 with upward firing speakers, quad core and touch screen. A personal user of it and wanna say it's top notch.
Should anyone have an interest, bump me a message"
Chromebook,"Hi, you can treat it as no warranty as none of the manufacturer provide international warranty AFAIK. But if you buy one you should get those Chromebook that's sold directly from Amazon so that their CSO night offer a better response in your query for warranty support.
Just my 2 cents. Cheers."
Chromebook,"The customer service at Amazon is pretty superb so while you might not enjoy full warranty they can probably arrange some degree of compensation, happened to me friend before"
Chromebook,"I don't think there are any dealers locally who sell the Pixelbook. I ordered one from Amazon but I have not received it. It is an expensive device for what it is, plus there is no local guarantee. This will be my first Chromebook and would be happy to report back on my thoughts after I use it for a while."
Chromebook,"The better looking chromebook pricings are almost similar to a full fledged laptop. Can't really make myself take the plunge..
Can i wipe a chromebook to install windows or do a dual boot if i dont like chrome os? assuming i can upgrade the storage as well"
Chromebook,"Bought it during Black Friday in Nov and I can say it has been amazing!
- Very portable thin and light laptop
- QHD resolution touch screen is amazing and very bright. I have an Acer Chromebook 14 as well and it looks dull in comparison.
- 3:2 aspect ratio is good as well for potrait mode. Very good choice by Samsung here, if you use a 16 : 9 screen in potrait it just looks weird.
- Playstore app optimization is getting better day by day
- Keyboard is not as bad as some reviewers mentioned, I actually like typing on this keyboard once I got used to it
- Only downsides I can think of are the speakers which don't get too loud and the bottom gets pretty warm sometimes but nothing to be worried about from the reviews I read.
Overall I'll say it's a perfect laptop for surfing the web, youtube, checking emails and etc at around $700+. I can safely say there are no Windows 2-1 thin and light equivalents at that price point."
Chromebook,Check this page out if you intend to do so but it's very troublesome.
Chromebook,"Happy CNY everyone. I am interested to get a Chromebook for my primary school kids. Anyone know if it will work with MOE eLearning websites like MCOnline, Xuele and eZhishi etc which I believe still runs on Flash.
Thank you."
Chromebook,"same here...lol
thinking about getting this"
Chromebook,"Yes, Chromebook support flash. Having said that, mconline flash implementation might be a bit buggy when using chrome. Based on my kids experience when using mconline and other elearning sites that uses flash, if they encounter flash not working or buggy, I've tried the following potential solutions for flash compatibilities:
Site settings > Flash > Allow.
Try deleting the browsers cache and cookies.
Try using the Google Chrome in the incognito mode. If that works, then temporarily disable your extensions to identify which one is causing the problem. To do this go to chrome://extensions and uncheck Enabled for each extension one by one.
Reset your Chrome settings to default.
Last but not least, if all else failed, switch back to windows."
Chromebook,Thank you for sharing your experience. Now I need to rethink if it is worth the trouble.
Chromebook,"So far it is still fine, quite rare to use Windows for mconline as most 3rd party elearning platform the school are using are going to html5.
My recommendation is to get a budget chromebook with touch screen that is 13"" - 11"", cost should be around USD 200-250."
Chromebook,"Thinking of getting a Chromebook, the Chromebook 15. But nowadays I worried that the laptop comes dead on arrival. Have you all had such experiences? Is there any way to mitigate the risk?"
Chromebook,"Buy from amazon, if dead on arrival can return back to amazon and they will refund you the money and shipping back cost."

C302CA will be faster then Spin 11 by alot.

Chromebook,How is chrome os reliability with android apps currently ?
Chromebook,"Chrome OS is very light weight and build for online and cloud computing purpose. With the integration of android apps it have the best of worlds of having the huge android apps collections.
The downside of android apps on chrome OS is that apps that are touch screen based or not compatible with chrome OS will have some issue. Meaning if the apps require touch screen, you will need to have a touch screen chromebook else navigation will be painfully difficult. Similarly for some apps are use to work for certain version of android, and it will not work for chrome OS if the programmer did not update the apps to be compatible to chrome OS.
Infact, I had changed my parent windows laptop to chromebox for more 5 years already. During these 5 years I do not have to deal with desktop support issue that are common for windows. The only 1-2 occasion is due to chromebox auto update that changes the UI which my parent need some help to find the icon to shutdown the chromebox.
Overall, chrome OS is for folks who need something portable to connect to internet for media consumption and office computing in the cloud. As it is light weight, chromebook hardware are relative cheap, reliable and long battery life due to very little power consumption from the os and hardware as compare to Windows and Mac laptop."

Chromebook,"Been looking into more and more Chromebook due to the current global situation forcing families to get multiple computing systems into their homes.
Samsung Galaxy Chromebook
Asus Chromebook Flip
Google Pixelbook Go
Also here is a sneak peek of the upcoming one from HP

It is just unfortunate that they are getting expensive for this year models.
How is your experience like working from home with a Chromebook or your kid's experience doing HBL?"
Chromebook,"If just for web browsing, HBL, video conference, Netflix, documents/slides/spreadsheets... Chromebooks are more than sufficient.
If wanna install loads of apps or gaming, go win/mac laptops, otherwise if only above scenarios would be a waste.
Especially if many family members do not want to take turns to use the laptops.  Couple of cheaper Chromebooks used concurrently make more sense."
Chromebook,"Chromebooks have
that Google enforces and is beyond the user's control.
After the expiry date is reached, all updates even security updates to the unit will be stopped.
Decide whether that is something worth living with."
Chromebook,"I don't find that a big deal.
Its not like you won't be able to use the Chromebook after the expiry date, its just no more new updates.
If you are IT savvy, you can install CloudReady ChromeOS with support for old hardware, just that Android Play Store won't be available.
I have installed CloudReady on a 2015 Lenovo X1 Carbon 3rd gen laptop and its working beautifully for my kids to access the school learning website. Everything works without any further fiddling. All this just cost me $390 for the 2nd hand laptop. Though I had to change the laptop CMOS battery."

Imo, i rather use windows on the x1 and have a separate drive for cloudready."
Chromebook,It's not tat cheap as old thinkpads cost roughly the same.
Chromebook,"Cloudready doesn't support multi-boot anymore. Haven't tried if it's workable.
After using Chromebook, it's quite  liberating not to worry about security or updates. Chromebook just works. And the battery lasts longer on it compared to Windows.

Chromebook,"chromebooks are not worth it anymore. In 2013 you could buy the basic acer c720 for less than
, or less than 200 shipped to Singapore.
Later acer came up with fhd 1080p 15 inch ips laptop acer chromebook 15 for less than usd 300, and Toshiba Chromebook 2 - a 13inch fhd ips with 100% panel for less than usd 300. Both can be bought from amazon, use forwarder, less than 400 sgd.
In that time, it was not possible to get such specs at the price and the cheapest brand new laptops were $600, and fhd ips panels were more than $1000. They can also be bios flash and install windows. Acer also had upgradable ssd.
Nowadays, may be better to spend on used third gen thinkpad, replace battery and maybe screen, total less than 300. Or there are fhd ips chinese laptops in lazada for less than 400"
Chromebook,"Hopefully the price of new Chromebook will be lowered when AMD Ryzen CPU are used instead of Intel i3/i5 CPU. The Celeron CPU just can't make it.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,"The laptop just got released in US - finally - at around US$1700 for the i7/16/512/mx150 variant. I really like the 3x2 aspect ratio and the overall look of the new matebook from Huawei. There has been no word as to whether this will be coming to SG.
So I am gathering opinions on whether it'd be worth it/safe to buy it from the US and ship it to Singapore through a forwarder service of some kind? Obviously the warranty won't be valid in Singapore.
Thoughts anyone?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Good laptop but no any warranty cover or change parts
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Yeah i also saw in another hwz thread that huawei sg told him no international warranty.
Btw, which website are u all buying the matebook x pro from? The cheapest i see is on newegg.com i think, the price:
1 items: S$2,370.78
Estimated Duty: S$191.36
Estimated Shipping:S$31.03
Estimated Total:
S$2,593.17
Im also very tempted to buy this, seems like the build quality and screen is the best out there"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Hey. Yeah, the build quality, screen and its aspect ratio is really tempting. I've also just checked again with Huawei SG and they still cannot confirm if it's coming to SG.
Anyone else have experience with importing laptop from US without warranty? My only worry is that I damn suay and end up DOA or something like that. Really burn $2k."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Not worth to spend that much money for something with no warranty. For that money, there are plenty of good enough alternatives."

Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I ordered 1 from Microsoft USA i7 version stil waiting fo shipment.
Us$1349"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,ship via forwarder?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Yup Going to ship via comgateway
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Do keep us updated when you receive it.
The only
issue
is the US-pin charger but since it uses usb-c to charge, can simply buy those 45w usb-c charger from lazada.
The microsoft store got updated with new stock, priced at 1499 for the i7. With shipping fee, should be just a little over 2k sgd. Very tempting."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Yup sure, Actually once you factor in shipment and gst , it is going to above 2K ... but well you can’t buy any laptop on the market now with just 2K that has this kind of specs.
3:2 format is great!
Power shouldn’t be a problem since it used usbc charging, this means usbc power banks will work as well.
I saw the surface book 2, but it’s disgusting that the basic model at 2188 isn’t even 8th gen. Same goes for the surface laptop still 7th gen. I might have gone for a surface laptop if it had been a 8th gen.
One thing for sure , even if they sell in Singapore it’s not going to be at the price I’m paying...."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"out of curiosity, did you manage to order from the microsoft.com site? I tried to buy using comgateway and alternative forwarder services MyUs, etc and order never goes through. Contacted MS and they told me they wont ship to forwarders; MyUs has separately confirmed this.
So was curious to know if you found a workaround?
Thanks!"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"3:2 is a great aspect ratio, that I agree. I am using a Lenovo Miix 720 and I like the aspect ratio myself.
I don't deny that buying it locally will not be cheap, but buying a laptop for more than 2 grand without warranty is a big risk."

Huawei Matebook X Pro,U need steel balls
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Just throwing it out there. If you have to pick between the Matebook X Pro and the X1C 6th gen, if both are the same price, which would you go for? The reason for this is that I can kind of get the X1C at roughly the same price as the Matebook through my organisation at around 2k+.The upside is that lenovo has the warranty support for 3 years. However, the Matebook has that gorgeous display and aspect ratio.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,"They use freight forwarding services like comgateway. Microsoft will ship to the provided address and then the company will ship the thing to you.
As an update, I've decided to be kiasu and go with the X1C6 instead, with 3 years warranty, a bit more than what would've cost me for the Matebook. Really such a waste they don't offer this locally.."

Huawei Matebook X Pro,"those temperatures that u mentioned are quite normal temperatures..
and surprisingly good for an i7
not sure why u say a lot of users report heat problems as far as I see from the link that u have sent.. simple search of keyword like hot and heat. most of them are praising how laptop remained cool. only one review says that it does heat up once in awhile."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I also hope to be wrong
Wish theres a display set can try it out physically
I think 2nd or 3rd review says theres
- coil whine
- fan is constantly on
- heat dissipation issues
- thermal design cld be better
Saw youtube reviews and was so wowed by all the good stuff. Any local owners pls share ur experiences too cheers"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"will review when i get my hands on my sets
youtube reviews are one of the reasons why i decided to buy 2 sets for myself and my hubby
dolby atmos sound and the 3k display screen are dope"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Tks! Yup screen looks so good. 13.9"" in 13"" form factor, v slim bezels and brightness 400+ nits. One thing i rly dislike is v dim displays"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Dunno when ms will stock up on the i7 models.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,should be late august but i do not dare to ship in on my own. later damage or battery cant clear
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Same as u get from that seller in carousell. Anything wrong I don't think he will refund.
Sent from Samsung SM-G965F using GAGT"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,the seller has a lot of good feedback and his stuff are all from usa
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"So he will help u to send back for warranty if anything happens ?
Sent from Samsung SM-G965F using GAGT"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Unlikely that it's the case. You're simply paying extra to buy the export set locally, because you're having second thoughts about the delivery portion. If you don't really mind waiting on delivery and are brave enough, might as well just purchase directly through a forwarding service, like what others here have done."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,ship back is easier than ship in cause u can have the battery removed
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Heat is definitely going to be an issue with very thin laptops. In fact, the numbers you mentioned sounds better than expected. Is that referring to the laptop surface temps or the actual CPU temps? I suspect the laptop may also be transferring some heat to the chassis, which will cause the surface temps to be quite high.
Couple more things you will need to consider are, what is the ambient temp and where did the user put the laptop, i.e. is it on the bed where the vents are blocked. These things will not be mentioned by most, but will determine how hot the laptop will run. Try looking out for some video reviews."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Price has dropped to $1199 as us Microsoft store!

Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Anyone with a Matebook bought directly from Microsoft, shipped via comgateway? How's the experience like? Is it hassle-free? I'm thinking of making the jump, instead of getting X1C6.
I only scared damn suay, package dented and whatnot."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,It’s hassle free. Just need to check the shipping date when you purchase from Microsoft. It take longer time from Microsoft to Comgateway then from comgateway to you.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,discounts are gone
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"What about things like damaged packaging and stuff? That's my only concern. I'm fine living without warranty since I take care of my stuff just fine, but I worry that it might get damaged on the way to Singapore. Quite irrational ah. I know. Haha."

Other than the rather shallow keypress, really cannot complain anything about this laptop. Definitely the best laptop currently."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"You guys snatched up all the sets from the SG sellers. No more for me to buy from. Haha.

Newegg SG $2127.xx, another $200 for gst and shipping.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,got source ar?

Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Can't find the amazon price anymore. All links are 1800++
really? got LTE version maybe need 2 lol."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Maybe sold out
Sent from HUAWEI NEO-L29 using GAGT"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"That amazon deal quite long le.
Last few days I think got error, it shows from $1,7xx to $1,9xx.
But when u click it’s $1,499, however when u add into cart there’s nothing.
Newegg also $1,499 with $50 gift card for every $1,000 spent last few days.
Just checked Newegg now back order at $1,499."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"The Amazon price of 1499 is only when there's stock. If no more stock, they'll fill in with the price from other retailers who share the same listing; most of which will be selling for much higher than 1499. If you want to get it at that price, you just need to check daily and wait for it to get restocked. The previous time Amazon restocked last week, it was sold out in under 2 days."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Den most likely is that piece I wanna add into cart got another person adding or bought le.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"That could be the case. However, in case you don't know, you can't order from Amazon itself and set your Singapore address. Amazon US doesn't deliver to SG, so you'll need to register for a forwarding service and input the address they provide you. Not all retailers on Amazon offer global shipping."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I was in same situation as U. I choose the X1 Carbon instead. I love huawei products but for me to spend this kinda money, I choose the X1 Carbon"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,amazon can preorder and ship to singapore
Huawei Matebook X Pro,The Huawei Matebook Pro looks good and pricing is good for the specs. seriously tempting to buy. I wonder if they will bring in to Singapore to sell. haven seen it around yet.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I asked the huawei store. they seem willing to entertain corporate requests but not for personal consumers.
anybody can comment on the difference between the xiaomi 45w USB-C vs the 60w USB C/5port USB-A charger. which would be better."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Just ordered from Amazon the i7 at US$1,499.  Stock will be in on 11 Aug."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Yeah I saw, the i5 think in a few days earlier."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei Singapore says negotiation and preparation are going on now to bring it to Singapore.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I think by the time they done with negotiation about bringing in gen 2 out lol...Singapore always so slow.
Sent from HUAWEI NEO-L29 using GAGT"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"That is exactly what I told them.  Even if they finally introduce in Singapore, I think the price will be much much more expensive than the US price.  Just look at the Euro pricing of Euro $1850."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"hows the matebook x pro going?
did u apply case or screen protector?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"But got one bro saying LTE version coming wor.
Nobody waiting for it?
And bought from amazon if any issue send back to US, warranty how long?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"there is no lte version coming
they wont put lte on a laptop like tis"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,I am thoroughly satisfied with my Matebook X Pro. Ordered a case/sleeve. Very convenient that the matebook is the same dimension as the old retina macbook pro.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,One quick question for those got the laptop - does the laptop feel hot?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I think it is in stock now. I just checked Amazon. US$1499.
Haiz...i guess that is expected."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"When charging and first couple hours, definitely ah, since it's updating windows in the background and stuff, but after that, not really.
You can look into undervolting your CPU using XTU. I did mine as soon as I got it. Went from 79 degrees on max CPU load to about 69 degrees. Pretty amazing result from just clicking a few stuff."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Btw CC charges for oversea currency fees is 2.8% right, unless using Amex?
While checking for rebates and promotion, happens to found out that this model promotion
beside the Microsoft $150 USD cheaper for students. There's early birds special which get up to $300 Amazon gift card."

Dunno when they gonna restock i7"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Just now managed to add one set i7 from MS in cart.
However unable to place order and when input CC, it removed from my cart....
For PayPal, do I have to topup my account in USD first or can I make payment and topup the amount later after placing order?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"You just link your card to your PayPal account. Don't need to topup or whatever. So when you pay via PayPal, it'll just deduct from your card the appropriate amount."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Thanks Bro.
PayPal fees is their exchange rate * 2.5% right?
Any other charges?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,I'm not entirely certain. You need to check PayPal's website.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Why don't you buy from Amazon since they ship directly to Singapore?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Cos is a want rather than need. Amazon now also OOS left retailer at higher price
I now got an itx rig and a old i5 420m Asus laptop.
So trying to get away with the rig in the meantime while waiting for MS stock.
So I can wait if able to get a better pricing.
I did consider the hassle and risk of using a forwarder but MS discount is approx 10%.
Now left newegg with same $1,499 +$2.99 shipping with $25 mastercard rebate promotion."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Oh, that was fast.  It was US$1,499 at Amazon this morning with stock from 15 Aug."

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Items auto removed from cart after 2nd image
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"This morning around 10am MS confirm got stock for i7.
I'm able to proceed further to add, place but only to be denied by my payment mode Paypal which they asked me to use another payment mode.

Tired of waiting and trying, I bought from Amazon.

when lid is close, it will shake abit when I press it on the top left with my fingers.
When lid is open, the lower right shake obvious when I press it."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"thanks for share
i read one customer has some build issue on amazon too
does the laptop run warm/hot and is it within comfortable range for u?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Haven really got time to test it yet, still trying to setup and install.
The design and screen I really liked it but quite disappoint by the speed of update of windows, super slow but could be my default setting for active timing in the update. It doesn't seems to update at all last night.
I find it quite hot when I on it for hours to just to update, bearable holding it but a nono if put on lap.
Mine is a Toshiba SSD, saw some comments that it's speed slow down significantly after updates of window.
Liteon SSD is a better choice but likely for first few batches set.
The charger came with it is compact but quite heavy.
Anybody using Xiaomi USB Type C 65W charger and any idea what's it weight?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Oh. Mine's the Liteon one. The updates only started trickling in like on my 2nd or 3rd day of usage. Go and undervolt it. I managed to cut 10 degrees off full load temperatures. The thing runs a lot cooler and it's very quiet now.
Don't need waste money buy another charger leh. Haha. Spend so much liao le. I just bought
from lazada. The fit is quite tight as compared to other universal adapters, so it won't come off after you stick your charger into it. Very worth the 5 bucks.
No issues with mine."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Undervolt in Bios or?
saw some comments posting dunno trying to undervolt how many times to avoid crash before but never pay attention to it.
Will read up again when I free.
The adapter u posted, I got alot hahaha.
sadly they don't have those macbook hard cover shell for protector."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Is use Intel XTU. just click click a few button only. I didn't bother undervolting bit by bit till blue screen. I just set mine to -0.100v settle liao.

What's going on ar?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Haha. No idea leh. I haven't encountered any problems with mine so far. Really worthwhile purchase, in my opinion."

Would like to ask the current owners here what third-party chargers they are using? Dun really feel like carrying around the original charger and travel adapter... I'm looking at
but scared power is too low and charge too slowly. Any recommendations for chargers?
Thanks!"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"You can just get the travel adapter I linked in one of the earlier post. The charger has a tight fit into the adapter so it's practically one piece now. No need waste money. Haha.
Hmm. I'll run Crystal disk mark tomorrow and see how it goes."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Matebook x pro has a 65W input.

Btw I couldn't factory restore the notebook.
supposed to HOLD F10 while power on but straight away came to windows or login screen...
Will factory restore back to older windows version without update?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Saw your earlier post, but don't think I want to add the adapter, looks like it would be quite bulky. Thanks though!
Looks promising! But have to ownself find the UK plug for input right?
Hahaha, this one a bit over budget..."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Got it from carousell with the UK plug
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"actually get this will do... go those hardware shop can get le
Currently I'm using Ankey 60W multi port, Huawei original charger with that adapter.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,getting my set tomorrow. will see about it
Huawei Matebook X Pro,really intrested in this unit.. hope to see more details user feedback!!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"You're referring to Seq Read/Write speeds right? Mine is 3162.4 Read, 2034.5 Write."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Liteon indeed better
Did u update all windows updates?
Only certain SSD affected when update.
Dell got patch for it, I tried to apply but can't Haha.
Sian.... I never set auto update but was given only update and shutdown or update and restart option.
Now back to crawling speed..."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I use this one at home.
It has 65w for the USB Type C port and 15w for the USB 3.0 ports and supports Quick Charge 3. Using just this charger I can charge the laptop, phone, tablet, Garmin watch and humidifier all at the same time."

Lastly Carousell got seller selling as low as $2,350 for i7."

Otherwise they will buy other models locally or models with international warranty?
I'm using this, bought $79 from Comcenter vending machine"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Sorry I'm a noob, can someone explain what this is? Charging because this is from USA so need something different?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Thanks Mr lin, do you know anything about the charging"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Nope. You can just use the charger provided, with a universal adapter to fit SG socket. That's what I did."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"You can use the original charger it works in Singapore just that you need an adapter.
Most of us are getting alternatives because we want a charger with UK plug."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Thanks everyone
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Oh Mazer cant ar.... regarding this Im not sure.
But Im quite like its small size."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,curious why are u selling?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Prefer MAC OS. Have been using for 5 years already.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I have just put mine up FS at Carousell too. Very satisfied with it, just that I got a Cobalt Blue Surface Laptop for dirt cheap and found that I don't really need the Matebook's extra power."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"OT a little, anyone has the Huawei Matebook D 2018? How's it?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Still going strong. I recommend this too
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Who says you need to spend $2K on any laptop?
This Huawei Mate X is not a good deal. Its got no touchscreen in 2018! still using Intel CPUs when the AMD Ryzen is way better and selling like hot cakes everywhere else in the world. Windows laptops that don't have touchscreens should be priced much lower.
The best laptop now is the HP Envy x360 13z 13 inch. Its a touchscreen 2-in-1 convertible and has a Ryzen 5 2500U which means that while its CPU performance is comparable to the Intel i5 equivalent, its GPU performance is 3 times faster Firemark score of 2000 vs 700 pts. 10 hr battery life too. Saw it at Harvey Norman late August and its already all sold out!"

Huawei Matebook X Pro,"The biggest nonsense you hear are from people who think that you have to spend a lot more than 2K to have anything decent. Which explains why idiots buy Apple products for example.
Currently the best deal on the market is the HP Envy X360 13"", which has everything touch screen, convertible 2-in-1, ultralight 1.27kg & slim, powerful and only starts at $1399 or so as an exclusive at Harvey Norman at Comex. Yet the AMD Ryzen 5 2500U has 3 times the GPU performance compared to the equivalent Intel i5.
People who tell themselves they need to spend a lot on IT typically just don't know IT."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Waiting on my brand new set from Microsoft! Just wanna share some of my exp.
My card was declined a few times when i was attempting to make payment via PayPal. Called bank and i was told no issue with my card but no records of transactions were made at all.
I was gonna give up and then a final try to simply make payment directly to Microsoft some users had problems with Microsoft before that apparently Microsoft do not accept foreign cc. It went through!
I was still skeptical though. The charge went through and appeared in my statement but the order status was still pending.
Today morning I receive an email from Microsoft that my order has been shipped and is on the way to CGW woohoo! FYI, order was made on Sep 5, so it was processed within 3 days
To all others who have been using your Matebook X Pro, any tips to share on your usage? Accessories to get etc?
Power Brick: I am divided between Anker PD and Aukey PD
Input: Anyone using Arc Mouse? Really like that it goes all flat when not in use.
Sleeve: Any recommendations?
P.S. oh, i also manage to use the student/military discount USD150 off! ;p
TYIA~!"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Take your shrilling elsewhere, man-child. You're cluttering up this thread with irrelevant evangelising."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Can share how to get such off? I got no student/military account.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"actually i dunno how i got the discount too. there was a button to check your eligibility. when you click on it it asks you to sign in to your Microsoft acct. after i signed in, it says i'm eligible and i got the discount!
i must have been a member of SEAL Team Six in my past life or something"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,What is the domain you use? like @military.gov or something @polytechnic.com? etc..
Huawei Matebook X Pro,my email? eh gmail.com
Huawei Matebook X Pro,I went to google and found the $150 off is general doesn't need to be student/military. How much does your shopping cost?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,i think the dob of the user matters too
Huawei Matebook X Pro,not sure yet but CGW estimated it will be USD58.45 so about SGD80? though i am planning to combine and use their onebox to save on shipping.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,haha prolly.. maybe we got senior discount
Huawei Matebook X Pro,What is the actual shipping cost for using cgw?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Is this a good price to buy from Amazon?
It is estimated at SGD 2,365.80 including shipping and tax.
Huawei MateBook X Pro Signature Edition Thin & Light Laptop, 13.9"" 3K Touch, 8th Gen i7-8550U, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, GeForce MX150, 3:2 Aspect Ratio, Office 365 Personal, Space Gray - Mach-W29C
Thanks."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Anker PD only 30W max.
Go for Aukey PD and must remember it is 60W model. Carousell should still have"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Are you still selling your matebook? Check your pm. Tks.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Check ur pm, tks."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Few weeks with the laptop now, everything is good. Bought this sleeve new pro 13 inch A1706 size, liking the ability to prop the laptop up a bit. However, sleeve is a bit too big for the laptop, and there is at least 2cm of excess space with the laptop inside.
Looking for other sleeves with a tighter fit, that have this same function. Anybody else bought sleeves for theirs?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Anyone using cwg to ship from US? Is the weight at 5.5kg or more? Thinking whether to lock my live estimated cost or wait for actual weight when item arrive. Pls advise. Tks.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"actual i dunno yet, estimated quoted is as per my post a few posts up."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Noted. Anyway I just placed an order from Microsoft store with $150 off and locked my CGW 5.5kg estimated price. Let hope everything goes smoothly.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Take your retardedness elsewhere if you can't even process facts, kiddo kid."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Even worse...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Just use the original charger with a universal adapter, like I did. I found one that fit quite snugly into the charger, so it's essentially just one piece.
The thing only cost me 3 bucks. Haha."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,oooh awesome. thanks!!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Any idea this able to work on Matebook Pro? This is for Macbook.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"This is a double USB C slot right?

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Looks good.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I got the one with Ethernet Lan.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Ivan you got from Microsoft at $150 discount, then shipped to CGW to forward to Singapore right? Mind sharing the final damage here, or PM-ing me?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Ivan:

Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Np bro.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,So far no problems on my end. Everything still very quick and responsive.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Mind pm me the purchase process and the final cost please?
Thank you"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Guys, just for your info.
If u happens to get a Toshiba XG5 SSD and could not bear with the slow write speed due to windows update issue, u can change to another SSD.
I'm using Samsung 970 Pro with it right now and doing a clean installation of OS, so far no issue detected :p
Remember to create a Window Boot disk first and download Huawei Drivers from the web.
1. Just unscrew at the laptop base All screw can be seen, there's no hidden screw behind the sticker or rubber feet
2. Tear away the white color sticker for SSD screw, unscrew the SSD and take out.
3. Insert ur SSD slowly, if got difficulties, unscrew a few screw beside it and the panel can open slightly bigger. This step needs time and patience
["
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Wah all the i7 sets sold already in CAROUSELL. Must be sold to ppl here in the forum lol. Hv to wait till next Friday
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Anyone bought from this seller?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"It's a really good laptop. I am still impressed every time I see the screen. Random people have also approached me when I'm using it in public and asked what laptop is this, since the screen looks so good. Haha. Only wish is that Huawei Singapore actually brings this in ah, so a lot easier for us to get, and also the warranty, for more peace of mind."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Wah making me want the laptop more 😍 yeah man, weird that Huawei Singapore never bring in....any feedback on the seller above before I reserve my set?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Does not provide any warranty. That’s ok since he is selling at an ok price.
He would not give u order confirmation email as well and in case you want send back Microsoft for servicing on your own. There’s no way you can do it.
Just get on your own from Microsoft with educational pricing."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Thanks for the info, how long it takes if order from Microsoft?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Bro can PM me your purchase details as well?
Thanks."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"coming soon to our northern neighbour,"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Whats the likelihood for it to come to Singapore?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,wah wah.. can go jb buy!!  maybe should just hoot though micosoft...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Waaah....M'sia launching but here no news. Meanwhile, I tried purchasing from Microsoft site but my payment via PayPalie rejected after trying so many times....haiizzz"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Chatted with Microsoft agent n was told they don't accept orders from overseas. Billing address must be same as delivery address in the states....found a cheap refurbished set on Amazon but the seller don't ship overseas. Asking my friend over there to help
Huawei Matebook X Pro,just hold until end of October! looks like it will reach Malaysia by end of October!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Already place order for the refurbishedset on Amazon n entered my CGW address. Hope it goes thru 😊🙏
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Why refurbished? What's the diff in price?
Sent from Huawei Mate RS...Blah Blah... using GAGT"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Alot of difference in price...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"ZZzzzzzzz den why dun u use forwarded or ask ur friend get for u from Microsoft.
$1349.99 USD"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Huawei malaysia and sg under same distributor?
Sg is convergent?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I'm not sure but I believe it's different. Buying from Malaysia doesn't mean Huawei SG covers the warranty also, you need to bring it back to Malaysia."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Seem like my harddisk is liteon
Sent from Huawei Mate RS...Blah Blah... using GAGT"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"urs early batch before july or august right?
btw now eligible for free shipping by amazon"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"just hoot from MS Store at US1349.99
1st time wentthru and order is being processed
will ship via CGW
How is the stock 512GB SSD? Thought of hooting the EVO 970 pro"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I think july
Sent from Huawei Mate RS...Blah Blah... using GAGT"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"How to test the r/w speed?
Also, u guys upgraded from W10 Home to Pro?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Stock SSD depends u got Toshiba or other brands..
if you dun update ur windows, Toshiba XG5 is ok Write speed 1K - 1.2K
But this also means that u need to set every new wireless connection to metered limit to prevent it auto update and cannot use lan connection.
I tried downloading Microsoft software to hide update but dunno why still got updated.
Window 10 Pro should be able to block the update...
There's free software to test ur speed eg. CrystalDiskMark.
If you dunwan to change, you got to wait for MS, Toshiba update or ok with the write speed.
Just to share with you my cost for 970Pro.
Comex 512GB with free printer at $349.
Printer sold $100
XG5 sold $120
So I only paid $129 and did a clean installation instead of cloning."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,I intend to upgrade to W10 Pro and I hope SITEX will have SSD sale for the Eco 970 Pro
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"What read/write speeds are you getting with the 970? I'm on the fence about whether to change or not, since the Liteon one is sufficiently snappy for me.
In case anyone is interested, this was the result I got when I ran it in the first week or so of using the Matebook."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"ur Liteon dunnid to change.....
Toshiba XG5 Specs: UP TO 3,000 Mb/s read / 1,050Mb/s write
I can get approx 2,7xx mb/s & 1,1xx mb/s
After window update, 2,7xx mb/s & 4xx mb/s
Samusng 970 Pro I just run the test
3,512 mb/s & 2,307 mb/s
But although bought from oversea, I believe warranty is still valid if u shipped back?
However if u change the SSD, most likely warranty will void as u need to removed a small sticker covering SSD screw."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I felt that my liteon lag when transferring files or activate program
Sent from Huawei Mate RS...Blah Blah... using GAGT"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"So warranty is void since u replaced the ssd?
I hope my is a lite-on ssd so dun need to buy the EVO
Cant decide to get the Evo or the Pro
My usage is primarily research surfing, Edmw n Ms word/excel n going bukit timah"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Ya. U enlarge and saw that screw tighten to SSD?
Supposed to have a small round white sticker.
Perhaps u can try to remove slowly to avoid damaging it.
And as for Evo or Pro, depends on ur needs and promotion.
My previous calculation for Pro is $129.
If I were to get Evo 970,
Comex price $269
Sold my XG5 $120
I would pay $149 for Evo with free $20 voucher which is same or higher than Pro because the $20 voucher u couldn't sell at $20.
So it doesn't make sense to get the lower specs at same price.
However if u managed to remove the sticker without damage, u may want to keep the SSD that came with for warranty purpose..."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,if u want warranty repair in singapore how do u do about it?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"You can't get warranty in Singapore. If you really want to claim warranty, need to send back to the US."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Anyone using the Logitech T630 mouse ?
My matebook shipped by Ms on Monday....
Now looking at skins, sleeves n mouse from TB
BTW how is the Ms Designer BT mouse?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Got mine from seller on CAROUSELL for $2350 for the i7 version. Do I really need to chg the SSD? Also saw some user saying that there is a partition that we need to remove before use the laptop....is this true?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Is this the one?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Not this
This one:

Carousell selling $75"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I bought this too from tmall
Thanks for the link
Was reading up the old threads n many of you using PayPal for Ms orders cos Cc got rejected
Strange. I use my ocbc visa n 1st try went thru successfully"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,aiya.. just when i want to buy from ms.. its sold out.. hahaha...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Personally, I did no such thing. The only thing I did was to undervolt it using XTU, so now the fan almost never turns on, and the whole thing runs a lot cooler and very very quiet. The whole 7-9 second boot time still amazes me, every time I switch it on.
Also, in case some people here don't know, default is set to Function key on, then only can use F1-F12. You can actually remap/swap the button to be Function on then can use the Function Keys. It's in the Huawei app on the laptop."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Can I run me thru the undervolting process. Nvr done it before.... thanks
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Can't install the xtu program. Keep getting error msg - You Are Trying To Install on an unsupported platform. ??
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I'm using XTU as well.
However despite I apply and saved, the setting will revert back to original after some restart of com.
Under Guide section, he use throttlestop."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Do u partition your 1tb drive or maintain only 1 partion?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Mine 500GB, clean install 1 partition. unless got hidden partition that I cannot see or create by system."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Does the latest Win 10 Pro 1809 support fingerprint recognition?
Just received my 970 Pro 1tb today
The matebook will arrive at cgw tonite though
Will arrange for express shipping"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,feedback on noise and heat.. after you make the swap... !!  thanks!!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I  got a brand new sealed model from ""chaplangkarangguni"" seller on Caroselle for S$2450 which is reasonably good considering exchange rate for USD1700.
So far so good.....loving the small bezel large 13.9"" screen.
Am a MacBook Pro user actually impressed with the build of this laptop. Will install MacOS as a VM on this laptop...."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Thanks will avoid buying from you
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Anyone applied new thermal paste on their x Pro cpu n gpu?
Got difference?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Hello all I am thinking of getting a Matebook X Pro i5 thru a friend from Shanghai. Was wondering if I need the version with the discrete graphics card?
My primary concern is battery life, to do work on MS PPT and Word and net browsing in general. The integrated card would suffice right?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Will Huawei bring in the laptop to Singapore? They just announce to bring in matebook X pro and matebook d together with new phone mate 20 to Malaysia.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"If you're only using it for those, then the integrated graphics card should be sufficient. I bought the i7 one, not because of the MX150, but rather for the 16GB ram and extra ssd storage though you can just swap out a larger ssd on your own ah, since I need the extra ram, due to the kind of programming work I'm doing.
The battery life, for me personally, is quite great.
Don't think so. I've emailed them in the past about it, but they said they have no updates yet. Maybe you can email them now. They might have a different answer."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Thanks bro, for the reply.
Can I ask a further question - was your i7 model purchased from the US or China? I read online that some users had difficulties with the fingerprint sensor after they did a clean install of English Windows 10 home via the USB Media Tool."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"It is not even 1.7k USD where did you get that figure from. With educational pricing about 1.349k
The seller doesn’t even provide any receipt if the buyer want to claim warranty on their own.
Please avoid."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Mine is the US set. I didn't do clean install ah. Signature edition mah, no bloatware other than the Huawei pc control/settings app thingy."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Damn
Doing clean install with w10 Pro Will remove the fingerprint feature?
My x Pro arriving on Fri from US
Anyone using w10 Pro?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I read from this reddit

But apparently there is a way albeit troublesome to resolve it. Just download drivers. From the US good la, no need change OS language."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Malaysia i7 price is RM6999
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Thanks mate

Huawei Matebook X Pro,How much u guys paying for forwarding when buying from MS?

Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Finally setup the xpro
The x Pro is so sexy and cool
Anyway, what's the use of the fingerprint sensor?
Just to start up the notebook?
Cannot use to shut down?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Bro did you pre order it? How did you get pass the requirement for a myKard?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Yes. Just to start up. Hold down power button for a couple seconds to sleep. Waking from sleep takes even shorter time something like 3-4 seconds, vs the usual 7-8 seconds.
In case anyone here don't know, DBrand now has Matebook X Pro skins."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Total how much ? Ownself import ownself from? Ok

Huawei Matebook X Pro,miscosoft still out of stock leh..
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"CPU: Intel Core i7Style: Laptop Only
To preface this review, I've been using this laptop for about a week now. I bought it from the Microsoft Store not Amazon, in case you're wondering why it doesn't say ""verified purchase"".
GOOD:
- Design: This is a very good looking laptop. The dark grey color is pretty much identical to the ""space gray"" that Apple uses on their MacBooks.
- Battery life: excellent. Watching youtube, editing documents, and other light productivity work yields about 8-10 hours of use.
- Display: Very bright and easy to use outdoors. Not quite as bright as the new MacBook Pros, but close. Color accuracy is skewed towards the reds, but that can be fixed with calibration.
- Keyboard: MUCH better than Apple's new keyboards. Very quiet comfy to type on. It feels very similar to the Surface keyboards which is a good thing
- Speakers: Excellent sound. The bass could be better, but the sound is very clear and can get fairly loud.
- The SSD is upgradable. Not easily upgradable, but it's not soldered in, which is a plus. If anyone is wondering, my unit has a Toshiba SSD. Write speeds are poor, around 300MB/s, read speeds are decent at around 1800MB/s.
NOT SO GOOD:
- Build Quality: After a few days of use, the laptop started to creak when I pick it up. I tried tightening the screws, but that didn't fix it. Very irritating. The USB C ports are also VERY tight. It feels like I'm going to break something when I remove the charging connector.
- Port arrangement: This is a minor one, but I wish they put one USB C port on either side instead of putting both on the same side. This would make it possible to charge the laptop from either side.
- Price: I think $1499 for the 512gb model is too much. At the time of writing this review, Amazon is including a $300 gift card, and that makes it easier to swallow.
THE TRULY AWFUL:
- Webcam: I can't think of a single scenario where using this webcam would be acceptable. Even for just casual video chatting, it's awful. I like that it can be hidden, but the positioning makes it impossible to get a ""normal"" view of your face. Not to mention the actual camera quality is poor as well. It's a 1MP camera.
- Touchpad: It's a Precision touchpad, but it sure doesn't feel like it. It doesn't even compare to the Surface touchpads. Even the ""click"" is very cheap feeling. Not to mention, the touchpad rattles quite a bit. Not what I expected for a $1500 device.- Coil Whine: Similar to the older Dell XPS 13, this unit has quite a bit of coil whine. It's amplified when plugged in. This is pretty unfortunate, but some people won't notice it.- Fan Noise: It's pretty much always on. It's not obnoxious, but it's loud enough to hear it in a very quiet room. If the laptop isn't plugged in and is on power saver mode, the fans do quiet down. On almost every other laptop, the fan is actually connected to a metal heatsink. On this laptop, there's about 0.5cm of space between the fan and the heatsink. This is just bad design and incredibly inefficient.
As for what comes in the box, you get:
- The laptop
- Power brick
- 2m long USB C cable
- A USB C dongle with VGA, USB A, HDMI, and charging passthrough. This DOES NOT support 4k@60hz, but hey, its included.
TL;DR: This machine is 90% of a MacBook Pro for ~70% of the price. It's a great value compared to a Mac, but compared to other Windows laptops, I think it's priced too high, especially for a ""new"" brand like Huawei.
Leave a comment if you have any questions and I'll do my best to answer them."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I encounter none of the problems listed above, in the review on Amazon. The fans are almost never on, and if they are on, it's very quiet. The touch pad is very sensitive, in my opinion. I find myself opting to use the touch pad even though I have a wireless mouse, at times. No coil whine or touch pad rattle like what's reported. I've been using it almost every alternate day since I got it in late-August."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Same here
No such problems on mine
I can't even hear the fan noise"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"What about throttling ?
Posted with Audeze LCD-X HardwareZone Forums app"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Is available now at 6999
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I click it shown pre order ended.
6,999rm price is good with pre order gift.
If they got service center in JB would be best."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,So my skin from dbrand came last night and I wasted no time in getting it on.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"That is nice.
Sent from Xiaomi POCOPHONE F1 using GAGT"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"very nice, u paste the trackpad also?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"will have glue stain after removing it??
Btw anyone successfully upgrade to win 10 pro version?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Just got mine today form KL Pavilion, i7 with some freebies."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Damage RM6999, but it includes useable freebies, I think. Letting go the Office365 Home subscription if anyone is interested, 5 users Mac/Win one year license.
Freebies besides the Office365 5user license, Huawei Bluetooth Mouse, Huawei Backpack, Huawei leather case & a 10% Off discount voucher for Huawei products valid till 31Dec 2018, I guess for purchase in MY, I think."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Unboxing it now and leaving the packaging at MY Home. Bringing this back to SG tomorrow SG damage is around $2,320.
Not bad I think, plus warranty is 2 years I guess in Malaysia but that is ok for me, I commute frequently to Malaysia anyway."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,SSD is Toshiba or Liteon?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Yes I did, with matte black skin. My first time applying, did quite a bad job imo. But oh well, live with it first"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Can’t answer now. But I doubt so, the material quality looks good. But you can do a google on dbrand and see if there are negative reviews on post-removal."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Installation hard?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Not as easy as I thought. Think of it as a skin rather than a cover. So precision is important. Of course, can always peel and redo until perfect but takes a lot of effort. dbrand has good tutorial videos by the way, they have a detailed video for Matebook X pro itself
For those who are keen, shipping took about 1.5week"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Ic, last time I can’t remember which brand I tried for iPhone and iPad, ended when I removed the iPad Apple logo tarnish stain Because use wet installation method and stain can’t removed.
This one which logo cut out is good"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Nice.
Did it come with 3 pin plug? Have photo?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Any room for nego??
Posted with Nokia 8310 HardwareZone Forums app"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Anyone install screen protector?
I find the screen quite reflective n want to minimize it
Any good sp to recommend?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"He buying to use, not selling leh....
Some more preorder can nego de?
Heard icarez not bad.
I got from tabao and buy the Anti-fingerprint, ended also glossy de.
I also bought the nano keyboard cover but after using sometime, still prefer to type without it."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Anyone know where i can buy at JB and whether still have stock? Really want to buy and thinking of going JB on Monday.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,How's the Matebook d?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"singapore where got display set to view? i dun want to travel to JB so far, unless i decide to buy"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Do you need the discount voucher by any chance?
Wondering if I could get it off you."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Comparable to Matebook X Pro except cheaper?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I dun think so...
Matebook X Pro is
3K touch screen
16GB
Btw just realise Dbrand skin got 15% off and free shipping to SG as long as purchase over $20."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"No such thing as display set, since no shop is selling the Matebook X Pro."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Yes, came with UK 3 pin plug.


The Ground pin can be pushed down flushed with the power brick."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Bought for my daughter, not for sale, sorry. If you are shopping for one it is a really nice notebook, the screen is outstanding."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Nope, I didn't use any discount vouchers at all, sorry not for sale, bought for my daughter and returned to SG last night, the only thing that she didn't like was the backpack which I will keep for myself. She's not the backpack type person, more of a sling bag person."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,He’s asking for the 10% voucher off next purchase from you
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Oh I see, silly me."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I left the packaging at my MY Home and didn't bring back the voucher, I may want to use it for another purchase soon, I didn't think about the voucher until your post."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,U using Magic Mouse for ur MateBook or mac?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,What I meant is did you manage to nego with them?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"BTW, how is 3:2 ah?
vs 16:9  better for youtube and netflix hor"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"It comes free with Huawei Bluetooth mouse, I am using MacBook Pro what you saw on the photo is my macBook Pro which is for my own use, the Huawei MateBook X Pro was bought for my daughter's use, it happens that I took the photo in front of my MacBook Pro."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Oh... cos I thinking of getting that mouse but online got mixed reviews and need download special drivers for windows and like not fully functionable
Huawei Matebook X Pro,That’s really nice. Hard to find this kind of plug in 65W
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Can consider mx master 2S or Anker ergonomic mouse
I rotate between them very good."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Im looking for slim type and find Magic Mouse is cool haha.
currently own mx master 2S and Microsoft comfort sculpt for home and office."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Maybe Logitech anywhere 2s also good.
Magic Mouse is indeed very slim but not easy to adapt. Find it tiring to use but good thing can use lightning cable to charge."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Anywhere I owned the 1st series before, its good and 2S should be better
Ya Magic Mouse cons and pros."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,If anyone want let go their 65w Huawei PD charger UK plug let me know
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Can we use mbp15's charger to power up or charge the matebook x pro?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,MY sell the 3pin power brick as an accessory?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Yup definitely cause Macbook one is 87W but theirs quite heavy.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Would love to know as well.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,i7 version avaible now in US micosoft!! yeah!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,the charger is the same as the usb c charger for mate 20 or p20 phone?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Thanks! Save me the trouble and money to find a three pin charger.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,hoot already??????????????
Huawei Matebook X Pro,How much u all pay for shipping from US Microsoft to SG
Huawei Matebook X Pro,I'm contemplating because of the warranty as this is not a $100 product
Huawei Matebook X Pro,buy buy buy!!!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Lol u really funny... if warranty is an issue, u can just forgo this model instead of wasting your time reading thru overseas reviews.
Else Malaysia is your nearest option for time being.
SG so far no news and much earlier post did mentioned they might be available to dump here when newer model is coming out.
But I doubt SG price is cheap and the price might make you reconsider other models."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Usd 150 for shipping is really no joke sia...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Includes gst
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Includes gst....
Huawei Matebook X Pro,The new MacBook air made me laugh..... Lol
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"ya man..start with 128gb ssd, really joke...
keep saying amazing..."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Does anyone have pictures of how the leather sleeve look?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"This is the smallest and lightest charger for USB-C 60w laptop and can charge mobile phone and tablets as well.
Otherwise, I think the Xiaomi 65W is the cheapest charger:"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Different.
No way would phone charger come up to 65W"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"First option is expensive and don’t do 65W
But still a good option.
Second one is the 2 pin. I think use the original Huawei 2 pin one can le"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"But the iPad Pro seems good
If the announcement was made earlier, I might get the iPad instead of Matebook and not sell my itx rig"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"A laptop would still be a laptop.

Can consider this beast
I’m using this at home at the moment but still searching for the original Huawei Uk plug charger"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"What good is it when you can't use it with a mouse or trackpad?  You will tired your hand moving around a big screen.  Furthermore, no headphone jack.  if you add it up with the keyboard and the pen, it is so expensive."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I need something that is portability, can watch movies and some simple excel work over the weekend out of house.
Happens to see good reviews for matebook, so got it after considering to sell my rig.
No regrets getting it, just that iPad is lighter"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"For light laptop, both LG Gram 13 or 14 are less than 1 kg and with long battery life.  iPad Pro 12.9 with the keyboard would probably exceed 1 kg."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Wah you already got a ITX rig ah.....so now you'd get the external GPU for gaming?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"The Xiaomi 2 pin doesn't have the ""holes"" you usually see in the flat 2 pin plugs. So doesn't really plug in very securely.
I am using this: https://www.hachi.tech/product/5055517351904/mazer-energ-m-egtravel-262c-65w-usb-c-pd-30-quick-charger
Has an extra qc3.0 port too. Do note that pd is only at 60w though."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I 'm using this,
But they say is total output 65w, not USB C 65w."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"No disrespect just sharing what I observed at Tech Show
Lenovo Yoga S730 can be had for $1,799.
Whiskey Lake i7+ 16gb + 512SSD + Local warranty  ""Cons : 13.3” FHD -16:9 as opposed to Huawei's"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Yup but no dedicated graphics card
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Yup I was considering this as well. Price point for that specs is not bad. But really cannot compare with the MBXP when it comes to the screen real estate.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"buy buy buy.. hoot hoot hooot...
wait wait wait...
still shipping my HWMPX"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Hi, can share where you guys order your hwmpx? Am looking for the amd version"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Is there an AMD version? I think you're referring to the Matebook D? I pre-ordered mine via Lazada Malaysia with the help of my friend.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Im also monitoring hwmxp and newer offering with whiskey lake.
The lack of warranty with high usd exchange rate combination is a show stopper for me.
Will definitely buy the matebook if it is at 1200usd range like the ms promo earlier.
Btw, the lenovo brochure shows 1999. 1799 is the onsite rate?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,$1799 is onsite. Suspect sunday can go lower....not sure they will throw in more freebies or not....
Huawei Matebook X Pro,1111 will have sale for mbxp?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Taobao already got 11.11 price if you dare to buy..
Huawei Matebook X Pro,The MS package cheaper la~~
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Before u quote me, u read this."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Tb 8688rmb is base model i5 + 8gb/256.
i7 16gb/512 is 12988 for most tb stores. Still nt worth it"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Just wondering, does anyone know of a power delivery charger with 3 pin plug? Realised when I use my mazer charger on my laptop not matebook X lol I sometimes feel a bit of grounding current. Checked around and it seems normal for 2 pin"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,I use the three pin charger from my mbp 15 on both matebook x pro n mbp also will feel the current on both laptops.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Yup using the original charger still can feel the current
Waiting for my new 3pin charger to arrive to see. If still have current"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Which charger you got?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"The aukey 60w charger from carousel
Comes with 3pin
Expecting delivery tmrw"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"expensive though. Energea has one with 60W PD for $50+?

for now i'm still holding off my purchase since i mainly charge at home. usage still quite low outside."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"This is fake 3pin, i.e. plastic top pin, so it won't be grounded. At this price, the Mazer is a better buy with an additional QC3.0 port.
The Aukey also looks like a fake 3pin charger?
So far I only found this Lenovo 65W charger:
and the MacBook USB-C charger provided you buy the extension cord."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I just received my i5 model and started it up today, but found that Windows 10 is really laggy and stuttering. The only changeI did was to delete my D drive partition, so as to enable Windows 10 to run on the full 256GB of SSD.
Should I wait for a couple of days and monitor to see if it gets better?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Leave it on for a full day. Update all your drivers via the Huawei app. New laptops are generally a bit slow for the first couple hours since it's running all the updates in the background.
My matebook x pro is still as snappy as when I first got it 2 months + ago."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Thanks bro. I also disabled my panel refresh which helped a lot with the stuttering in chrome browsing.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,anyone else bought from MS store with less than 150 USD delivery & GST charges?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Saw the Matebook d Intel core i5 for rm2999 at Huawei shop at aeon Bukit Indah. 2 year warranty. Quite tempted.
The Matebook X Pro i5 is in stock. Need to place order for the i7."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Confirm RM2999? If it is I'll go tmr and buy xD They got they say need wait how long for i7? Did you see any matebook x pro over there?
Edit: I read wrongly. ps. How much was the i5 x pro? Do you rem?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"u sure is 2999 and not 4999?
Sent from Samsung SM-G965F using GAGT"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,4999 shld be i7
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Thanks for the correction didn't pay attention to the X pro as it's over my budget. My bad.
Is the Matebook d screen touch enabled? Could find the answer."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"i7 is 6999 ringgit

Huawei Matebook X Pro,"My skin for the matebook x Pro

Like a piece of marble tile lol...."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Very nice! If only can use pen. Wanted to buy then I read online they say this one cant use pen. Wanted to get one to write notes. damn wasted bc its a really good laptop
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Has the Toshiba SSD write speed problem been resolved by any windows update?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,anywhere to buy this??
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I notice the laminate or plastic film wrapped around the charger wasn't very well glued or stick to the charger. After i removed the wrapper, I saw some air space and tried very hard to peel n poked it only to realize it shouldn't be removed but it was too late. Now I have a defaced charger."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,I wonder which part are you referring to?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"If u refer and zoom in to the two photos of the charger that u posted, u will notice the laminate at the surface especially those near to the corner have some air pockets."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Any idea where to buy matebook x pro? The only laptop that suits my requirements
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Not launched here yet. Waiting for the Matebook d until neck long already.
Most owners here buy from Amazon and carousel.
Can go Johor buy from there."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Very nice laptop... In Malaysia now
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Is it worth to pay for i7 model? Price difference quite big
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"If our in Malaysia, SG should be soon too right."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"It will be worth it if you are using it for photo editing or simple coding. But if you are just using it for Microsoft office and email, just get the i5 model.
Sent from OnePlus ONEPLUS A3000 using GAGT"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Seconded. I'm provided with a i5 8gb notebook for work. Usual office, internet, few online applications. Using it with targus dock to link with 2 monitors."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"But I removed it totally, that is like shrink-wrap material, I always removed these."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei Singapore has told me that they will be launching early next year as they are finalising the full service centre now.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,By then they could launch the next version already? Hopefully they'll price the notebooks reasonably.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"i think you will be looking at the same price from USD to SGD then add GST...
i hope they sell the accessories... like the power.."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,I'm fine if that's the case.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Anyone knows any place in JB that I can get MBXP screen protector + installation?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Advice need....not sure when and how , the screen at the bottom left corner cracked while in my cabin bag.
Where can I send it for repair ? 😶"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Where did you buy it from? Not launched here yet so parts would be an issue.
Maybe can check with Huawei Malaysia? Service centre at Taman Molek. It's sold there."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"KSL also got Huawei shop and there's a sample on display.
Can check there as well too."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Got it in China
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"KSL is ? Got contact , many thanks in advance"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Call them. You'll need to bring notebook to Johor IF they're willing to repair for you.
https://consumer.huawei.com/my/support/"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Thanks for the information =
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Just some info for those considering import set.
Singapore Service Center , no repair no quote cause they claim no technical guys capable of doing such repair.
Malaysia Service Center, no repair due to set not being bought from malaysia..."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Found this but out of stock.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Lower price range under honour brand has been launched.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"900 usd for i5 seems alright, too bad not available in Sg with warranty. Spec wise closer to matebook d than to x pro"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Another model, Matebook 13, announced but still no launch in Singapore."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Just as an FYI for other users, I am currently using ThrottleStop instead of Intel XTU, since  the XTU settings seem to reset upon reboot of laptop. The ThrottleStop setting sticks, so I've opted for that instead. It's actually pretty simple to set as well. My CPU temperature fell from 45 deg to 35-38 deg under normal usage like browsing web, MS Office, etc. Fans almost never turns on."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Any link to download?
Sent from Google PIXEL 3 XL using GAGT"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Just google for throttlestop. It's the techpowerup website. When you open the software, click the FVIR button in the middle bottom area. It'll open another window. Tick the

option. I'm using -100mv for CPU Core, CPU Cache, Intel GPU and System Agent. After you're done selecting all the values, bottom right corner, remember to select
OK - Save voltages immediately
, then click Apply -> OK, and then can close the thing."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Now, this new super slim bezel Asus 14 inch seems to be better value than the Huawei Matebook X Pro at S$1,898 no high resolution touch screen but with HDMI port and Numpad on Trackpad:"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Thanks for sharing! My matebook's fan used to turn on whenever there was windows system update. After following your steps to set at -99.6mV closest setting that i can adjust to follow yours, the fan indeed didn't turn on even though i ran many applications together."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"433 model have trackpad issue though and slower mx150 like mxp. Also asus just announce a better value ux431 with thicker case might be better for temp. But mxp screen is really good color, brighteness, resolution and good online support active community. But if you really want to consider asus, maybe can consider getting from Malaysia / China as their set are cheaper and asus has international warranty."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I saw the ASUS ZenBook S13 UX392FN, this might be the closest to compare with the Matebook X Pro. But I guess it will have the same limited availability as all other ultrabook.

Posted from PCWX using Mate 20p"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Which courier did you use to ship from Microsoft store at US150 inclusive of courier and GST?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I believe they used comgateway. That being said, since it is available in Malaysia, it's more worthwhile to buy the set from Malaysia. At least, you'll get the charger with our 3pin plug, and also, if anything goes wrong, can just hop on over to Malaysia and claim warranty."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Yes, agree with this too. Recently I received email from Huawei Malaysia telling me that the i7 version is back in stock. 6999rm plus some free gifts.
Sent from OnePlus ONEPLUS A3000 using GAGT"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"RM6999 is much higher then getting a carosell set or a set you get yourself from micosoft us. for just a 3 pin plug.. er.. maybe not really worth it...
since its type C.  i can buy many other type of charger.."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Ya.. I was doing calculations last night.
Buying from Malaysia:
+ Easier to exercise warranty claim/support
+ Get 3 pin/UK plug
+ Free gift Laptop case, Backpack, Bluetooth mouse
+ Possibly no GST own's discretion ah
- Incur time to travel to Malaysia S$50-80~ travel cost
Total damage: RM6999 + Travel cost + Time cost = S$2,400+
Buying on Microsoft Store with Comgateway:
+ Deliver to door-step
+ US$150 off with Student/Military discount
- Incur GST + Comgateway US$150~
- Send back to US for warranty
- US 2pin plug need to separately purchase adapter ~S$60
Total damage: US$1349.99 + $50CGW + S$100GST + S$60adapter = $2,100+"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Wah..
Matebook 13 seems like a very strong contender. Now I'm torn between Matebook X Pro or wait for Matebook 13. Seems like a strong upgrade with few downside compared to X Pro.."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Anyone ordered from Microsoft Store US recently? I keep getting the error :""We're having trouble processing your payment""
However I did select the paypal option to pay, but under paypal I'm paying via my SG credit card. And then after selecting the paypal option for payment I still have to set a billing address but I'm unable to set a Singaporean address which is probably why the payment isn't successful.
To those who bought from Microsoft Store US via paypal, may I know which payment method in Paypal did yall use?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,This one bo thunderbolt
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"You can't use SG credit card for US Microsoft Store, iirc. Someone also had this problem earlier on in this thread. Easiest alternative is to use the payment feature of your forwarding service. I know comgateway has one. Regardless, your forwarding service should provide you with a US address, right?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,i paid using my singapore credit card....
Huawei Matebook X Pro,I don't think thunderbolt is an essential feature tbh
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Malaysia set got mate dock included, is it same for US set?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Yes, the US set also comes with the mate dock the extended dongle thingy with vga, usb-a and usb-c."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Thunderbolt is really not that essential for most people. In fact most people I heard generally only use this for those GPU enclosure. So if that is not the case, nor are you using it for display purpose, then it is really just a nice to have feature."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Anyone able to get any andriod emulator working? I tried a few and all dont seem to work
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Thunderbolt 3 ports draws more power right? For example, at work I have 2 external monitors and my laptop can be connected to the setup with just one USB C cable to the TB3 port, and it also chargers the laptop at the same time.
One cable, 2 monitors + charge the device. Not sure with the same can be accomplished with any other USB C port."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"how are you owners liking this laptop?
price aside, i'm deciding between this and the ux333."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,love it.. and since huawei is like an 'enemy' now... its the best... hahaha
Huawei Matebook X Pro,It's a really great laptop. No issues for my unit so far.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"anyone of your matebook received win10 1809 update already?
mine still 1803, the rest of my notebook already got 1809"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,mine 1803 and there's no new update when I search.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Is it still worthwhile to get this laptop now?  It's been a year since the release so was wondering if they are going to refresh this model..
Huawei Matebook X Pro,2019 one just released
Huawei Matebook X Pro,They increased tb3 lanes and changed to whiskey lake.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"The mx250 is better than the one that came with the 2018 model?
It seems to me like a less powerful version of the full fledge 25w mx150 but suck less power chip.
The 2018 one came with 10 watt mx150 right? wonder if its a increase in performance?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,this one like ala the 'S' model of the ipones...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,The way I look at it not much enhancement. Maybe wait for 20X pro. Lol
Huawei Matebook X Pro,it just an overclocked MX150.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Significant changes in this 2019 update:
1. 4-lane Thunderbolt 3
2. MX250
3. Uses the Sharkfin 2.0 cooling found in the recent Matebook13 cools faster? Less noisy? dunno, gotta wait for teardown to see how efficient they implemented it
4. i7, 16Gb model is $1,999 pounds sia
5. Enhanced Huawei Share if you are fully into Huawei's ecosystem, this will be a +
6. 3-fingers Gesture screen capture not sure whether the software update will be enjoyed by older models
7. They removed the ""CNBC logo"" from the back, and used a slightly more stylish Huawei text logo
For current 2018 X Pro owners, seems like no reason to upgrade. For aspiring X Pro owners, this is much more expensive then the last year model, which is selling at Amazon for US$1.3k"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,anyone recommend any bt mouse for the laptop.  i got a cheap-ish logitech one that does not work well..
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I'm using a cheap wireless not BT mouse that is rechargeable so don't need source for batteries. Having the wireless dongle is not an issue for me, since I don't use the USB A port. My thumbdrive is USB C."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Better pricing in the US?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,how are you guys using the US adapter? is there a reliable source to buy a local adapter?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Just use an adapter to use with SG plug. If you want to spend more money to buy another adapter, I went with this Aukey one since there's also another port to charge my phone or other peripherals.

Huawei Matebook X Pro,Should i just buy the laptop from amazon? There doesnt seem to have any news for the newer mx250  / 8565u?  version.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,If I buy from Microsoft with student discount and then deliver to sg via freight forwarder will the total damage just make it more worth to just buy from a sg seller like on carousell?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,buy from amazon best for nwo
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"You can self calculate to see if worth it or not. I bought mine from an SG seller who imported it. A lot more peace of mind since I can check to see if working or not, before paying for it. The downside is that I paid more than if I imported it myself ah. But so far, no issues with my unit at all. I've been using it almost daily since September for work.
Just remember to undervolt so it runs a bit cooler and quieter."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,yeah I checked its about 1.4k usd or 1.9k sgd if I pay in usd or 2025 usd if I use the amazon currency exchange thing. But idk if I shud pay in usd or sgd anyone got any advice
Huawei Matebook X Pro,pay in usd. cheaper

Huawei Matebook X Pro,looks like get from US is still cheaper. about $1950
Huawei Matebook X Pro,price dropped on amazon. can hoot
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"after being on sale usd 1139 at amazon sunday, now the item is removed from sale entirely
no idea if they will honor those who bought sunday
also up in the air when new one listed, what will selling price be etc"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Totally missed it...I took too long to think
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Maybe they trying to clear and make way for new model?
Anyway i7 $1139 is very good price, big saving from RRP $1499 and MS $1349."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I managed to get a set, received it yesterday, total S$1694"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"i think $1694 is a really good price for such a great laptop
cos my laptop still working great and i dont really need to buy now. also they announced 2019 model may hv 1tb ssd and improved shark fin 2.0 cooling
maybe new model will not need to undervolt to run really cool
but this is nitpicking. enjoy ur lappy bros"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,will go check it out... maybe this weekend... see got what...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,can use this to charge my matebook? i ordered from amazon
Huawei Matebook X Pro,or this?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,how to under volt??
Huawei Matebook X Pro,how do you guys disable the intel GPU and force the laptop to strictly use mx150?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"one more question :
Which pd battery charger to buy for >26k mah to charge the laptop?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Newegg flash is selling the i7 variant for 1139.99 usd.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Shipping + gst roughly about how much?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"i marked as a gift and shipped to my forwarder.
not sure how much shipping will be.
my order has just been shipped out by newegg"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,hi may i know which forwarder u use?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"just got my matebook x pro. the display like more yellowish compared to my MacBook pro 2013...
is this normall?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Not at all normal. If anything, the MacBook display is usually warmer in colour.
There is an option to tweak the colour of the display. You just right click the desktop and the option should be there somewhere."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Might wanna check it out now on the Microsoft store, its $200USD off for the i7 and $150USD off for the i5.
Brings the SGD price of the i7 down to $1750~ if you have Youtrip / US dollar card and can get good USD rates.
if u add GST and Vpost fees, comes up to around just abt 1.9k.
Pretty worth if u ask me for 512gb, 16gb RAM, i7 8550u and MX150. Im not gonna wait for the 2019 model."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Anyone else experienced this issue recently trying to order the Matebook i7 model? I tried paying via Credit Card and PayPal and both options failed
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Do update your matebook x pro shared by a Friend
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"hi guys, i tried buying the laptop through microsoftUSA and newegg. all the payment got declined due to international credit card. can i check how you guys managed to purchase it from the states?
Many thanks"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"You can use PayPal, or pay via your forwarder."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"the main different between 2018 and 2019 model is the nVidia graphic card
and the display quality hor?
the CPU is newer but the performance really got different?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"The GPU MX150 vs MX250 also not really that much different, in terms of performance. Same thing with CPU 8550u vs 8559u.
Display are identical between the old and new Matebook X Pro.
The main difference is just that the USB C port now support 4 lanes TB 3, instead of original 2 lanes, and the new version of the XPro supposedly has better cooling. Oh ya, they also changed the logo slightly.
In my honest opinion, not really worth shelling out the 4-500 bucks extra for those, unless you really need it."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"2019 models officially launched in china:

the i7/16GB/1TB SSD model price is"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Juz ordered a 2018 version from amazon total damage shud be around 1750ish, was gonna wait awhile to see if the price will drop further but decided against it coz lazy to keep tracking haaha"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Hi guys! So buying from Amazon is the cheapest way to get one of this into sg? Got poisoned by this but so difficult to buy in sg!!
Is it worthwhile to wait for the price to drop since the 2019 model is launched?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"It will be released in May. Just released in China.

Guess price around the same. I’m waiting for it, can’t wait to pair it with Razer core x + Vega 64."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Yes, I've good intel that it will be retailing in Singapore in a few months."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Yes, I've good intel that it will be retailing in Singapore in a few months."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,any intel on the pricing?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,2019 ver wun be cheap
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Hope the pricing will be reasonable. Otherwise no point.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Wat type of laptop sleeve are you guys using. I'm thinking about getting the amazonbasics felt case but I scared will be too big.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Same! I got it last week when Amazon price dropped to US$1199. Finally pulled the trigger after tracking price since February.
Hopefully our units will be defects-free. Just hope that I don't need to fix the trackpad / any heat issues.
After contemplating for a long time, 2019 version is really not worth the upgrade, price:feature wise."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Yeah hopefully no defects, btw did Amazon give an estimate on when it'll arrive. Mine they estimate between Monday, April 29 - Thursday, May 2 coz its still back ordered"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,you can do the mod guide for the heat. I did extra by pasting thermal pads 3mm = too thick from heatsink to bottom plate which drives down the max load temp to comfortable range from 90c to 65c.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,did you find it dif to mod coz I'm thinking of modding as well but I'm afraid I may screw something up
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Nice share. Will diy in the coming days.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,If u receive a faulty set from amazon is it send back to them or bring to msia service centre?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"not as daunting as i thought.
But i had to wait for all parts delivered before i did the mod.
- thermal pads different thickness - gelid GP-Extreme
- thermal glue for the shim
- thermal paste gelid extreme
- copper shims for the heatsink - gpu
- repair tools kit you will need t5 hex screw driver for bottom cover plate & mini philip head screw driver for the heatsink
Just to make sure the screws are separate accordingly to the layout as they are different sizes. two types for the bottom cover plate & three types for the heatsink excluding fan.
The video should covered the below mentioned.
- After unscrewing the bottom cover plate, run the guitar pick along the sides then the top with the bottom facing up.
- The stickers at the bottom cover should indicate the orientation.
- Lift the bottom cover from the top side by sliding upwards and top direction as there is a catch near the sticker area. Failing to do so might break the catch."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Thermal paste/pad fix will void warranty right? I haven't done any thermal fix before but am inclined to do so for this laptop - I'm just lacking experience on this.. Do you think it's easy to screw things up for first timers?
@randy - mine will arrive early next week. Expedited shipping.
For units from Amazon, my guess is warranty claim if any is dealt with Amazon or Huawei USA, not Malaysia."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"yes. think huawei US would void it. Very few laptop companies allowed such mods with warranty. I had the laptop for two-three weeks before i did the mod. So it was not giving me problems earlier and i dont expect it to be later as well.
i was not comfortable with the temp as the keyboard get pretty hot to touch near the screen. Now it is warm when loaded which is fine for me as i have directed the heat toward the bottom cover. I have to lift the back a little for airflow when using it.
I had tons of experience with PCs but it was my first time with laptop. So mileage might differ. Just make sure you have all the equipment before doing the mod."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"You can just undervolt it using Throttlestop. It helps a bit, I guess? Also, for those who have yet to get theirs, I can't over-emphasize how much I love my Matebook X Pro. My unit is on 8-9 hours a day, 5 days a week, since mid-August. So far, no issues whatsoever. It's really worth every penny spent. Also, it needs mentioning that the dongle thingy that they provide is really solid. Most dongles can get quite hot over extended periods of use, but I haven't encountered anything like that with the included dongle. I have a second display via the dongle using VGA, which is on 8 hours a day as well.
For me, since I do quite a fair bit of programming and simulation, I find that it really helps to get a laptop cooling pad even more so for the Matebook X Pro since it has a metal chassis. Best $10 spent."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Dunno why throttlestop has been freezing my x whenever i reboot. Thus i deleted it from x. Strange.
Sent from Samsung Galaxy S10+ PRISM WHITE using GAGT"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Gotten a toshiba nvme ssd set. Well llst
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"How to buy from Amazon? Direct? Any GST?
Sent from Sony D6653 using GAGT"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Will be taxed for sure.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Toahiba no good?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"+ install RateX on Chrome browser. Pay using RateX's USD the exchange rate is better than using Amazon's.
Do note that the price on Amazon fluctuates a lot every other day. Best to set up a camelcamelcamel.com price tracker and monitor. For me I set it to notify if it drops below US1200 and pulled the trigger at $1199. Missed the $1139 deal."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Liteon SSDs are supposedly better. This was my read/write speeds, ages ago. 3k read, 2k write. The Toshiba one has supposedly sub-1k write speeds."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"That time Toshiba NVme got issue after Windows update, the Read & Write speed drop tremendously to turtle speed.
Now I'm not sure cos I had changed to Samsung Nvme 970 Pro long ago."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Many many updates after that still not corrected?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"wah i learn a lot from this post alone...
got such thing as camelcamelcamel ahahhaha"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,I ordered at 1199 but amazon for some reason went and cancelled my order so now I'm waiting for the price drop again. Haizzzz
Huawei Matebook X Pro,still cannot update to MS 10 1809 right?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"glad my post helped! There are also Amazon price tracker apps you can download. At least there's a couple on Google Play store.
My i7 $1199 unit arrived today! Ordered on 13th Apr. Total damage $1,798.05 Sing dollars include priority shipping + tax."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"any matte screen protector to recommend?
the screen is pretty reflective in bright environment."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"You can install it at Sim Lim Square. That's where I installed mine. I don't really recall the shop number though, but I remember that it was 4th floor, and it was some corner shop. When I was asking around for laptop screen protector, the lady asked if I wanted clear or matte. They don't sell any pre-sized screen protector for our laptops, so they'll need to measure out and custom cut from a bigger piece.
Cost around 20+."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Does it affect the clarity of the screen? like blurriness of the words.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I installed the clear one. No issues encountered whatsoever. In fact, it's ness smudgy now. Lesser fingerprints on the screen."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Thanks. will check them out.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Might want to consider tempered glass protector as well although the con is that its not going to be matte. Read that the screen is quite sensitive.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I don't think tempered glass SP is advisable since that will mean you can't fully close the laptop. How do I know this? I am currently using those rubbery/jelly-like keyboard cover for the Matebook X Pro, which is super thin, and even then, when I open up my laptop every morning on my desk, I can see the prints of the square key-caps on my screen. I don't carry my laptop around. I only close my laptop lid every day before I leave my desk. This is what leads me to believe that the Matebook X Pro actually closes quite flush with everything inside. I imagine that if you have a tempered glass SP, it might either hurt the screen since tempered glass SPs are generally thicker than plastic/film SPs, or the keyboard; especially so if you carry your laptop around when closed."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Guys
My mate book pro x is not charging even when the charger is plugged in.
I tried using both USB C slots but no use
Any advice please?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Try this.
Open PC manager -> Power Management -> Power optimizations ->
Others -> Battery Protection:
Choose Family Mode or Office Mode or Travel Mode"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Battery depleted, faulty charging unit, etc"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"If you're using the included charger, make sure you plug the usb-c cable properly into the charging brick. There needs to be a click-type of feeling at the end."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,I like the Huawei Matebook X Pro is just thin enough to allow for a USB-A port on one side. Cool bros!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,try swapping the direction of the usb-c cable.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"BTW I am using the Aukey charger that was recommended by some of the users here
Back to using stock and so far its charging"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"If that's the case, then the Aukey charger is what's faulty, and not the Matebook X Pro..
Another thing to try with the Aukey charger is to plug it into the laptop, turn on the charger and give it a couple seconds. Sometimes it takes 5-10 seconds before it starts charging."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"My one is still going strong. When this happen either cable or charger first culprit

What powerbanks are u guys using? I use the Xiaomi powerbank gen 3 and recently
bought the omni usb c with wireless charging for my AirPods the latter is expensive but 2 USB c ports."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"about the 20k xiaomi powerbank. how much juice can you get from it to charge the matebook laptop?
My charges are
20 to 70 = 50%
20 to 90 = 70%
6 to 78 = 72%
Is there something wrong with it?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Maybe not calibrated yet?
Drained it to 0 and full charge will give u more accurate reading
I didn’t really track the reading as I got 2 units of the xm powerbank and they were really cheap for what they are capable of. When I bought it was about $50 from here

That being said I only charge my matebook x pro when it is below 20% and when it is done I can get near to full bar also I use the laptop while it is charging so can’t really tell how much juice it gives"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I use the Aukey charger on the new macbook pro with no problems
Maybe the Aukey no like the mate book lol"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,I tried without using the laptop and tried to charge with a single unit of xm powerbank - gotten 77% from 2%
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"thanks for the feedback. 75% that was almost the same as mine. thought i had a lemon. Looks like i need to get something more powerful.
Thought 20k was sufficient for a single charge."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Hard to find something more powerful.
If u want higher capacity - weight and cost also go up. No value proposition.
This one sweet spot. For heavy users, 2 units just nice - 1 at home and another 1 at office. If not just fully charge up ur laptop and bring the powerbank out. Last u for 1 day for sure enough."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"my heaviest usage can only last 2hr on full battery.
Now playing with remote desktop access offloading the heavy work to the remote PC to see if i can prolong the mileage."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Seems a bit odd that you're only getting 2 hours. I'm running simulations and stuff like that every day on my laptop average 20-40% CPU utilisation, with brief peaks at 80-90%. Worst I've seen was 4 hours on a full charge. On a normal day, I can get by with close to 8 hours."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Could be the intel gpu and mx150 usage. I am using game engine and modelling program.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Getting the newest model in

Will sell away my current set soon"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Mine doesnt save the settings.. Werid
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Huawei my price for matebook 13.
I5 8gb+256gb SSD rm3,999
I7 8gb+512 GB SSD rm4,399"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Does Huawei Malaysia online store ship to SG?
When will the new 2019 models be out?
Will Huawei Singapore bring in the notebook models?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huawei Singapore will be carrying but not sure when.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,how much u looking to sell for. I'm trying to get a set and alr had an order placed wif amazon but they went and cancelled my order so now I waiting for the price to drop again. Idm buying second hand if the price is reasonable
Huawei Matebook X Pro,I’m actually bringing in the 2019 model. Us market only have the 2018 for now.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,I mean that I'm looking to buy ur 2018 model seeing that u are looking to sell it soon. Hahahaha
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Yeah would like to know the 2018 model pricing too.
By the way how much is the 2019 i7 model?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Brand new i7 2018 model is going for $1780 on Carousell. So cheap nowadays.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,but the seller for 1780 Mia hahaha
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"There's also a couple other sellers all selling around that price mah. Personally, anything under 2k is already a very good deal. A lot more than what I paid for mine, back in August. Hahaha."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I think at this point best to wait for the new model.

I predict late May to early June should come out"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"The new model has a starting price of around 4-500 higher than when the original 2018 model came out. This is because the first one was so popular, so they know they can charge a higher price for the newer ones."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Just received the 2019 set
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"May I know where you got this and what is the damage?
Thanks"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"passed through IMDA database liao

means coming soon officially"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"From China. Maxed out specs.
About 2.2k after shipping and taxes.
Actually really feel the same just that this one 4 lane thunderbolt, Huawei logo looks fantastic as compared to previous one, has Huawei share feature good for those using Huawei phone - useless for me"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Agree with this.
I feel they will price it similarly to XPS 13
The i5 close to 1.9-2 and i7 may well be over 2.4-2.5"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"u reinstall the Windows to English by full formatting?
where u get all the drivers and software from?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"if you factory reset the machine, wouldn't it revert back to the Chinese OS and Drivers?
Very nice price of $2.2k though, I seriously doubt it will be anywhere close when it lands on our shore. At least 2.6, 2.7.
2018 model is more worthwhile - unless money is not an issue"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"There are actually few ways to go about changing the language be it full wipe or just changing the language and keeping the stock applications. Stuff u may need in the process include oem key, thumb drive, etc,.
The stock Drivers and applications u can easily find it on
Drop down from the list and choose the correct model"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Easiest is to just buy oem key and change yourself. There's a couple videos on YouTube relating to that, specifically relating to matebook x pro. The key is under 20 bucks, from lazada or something like that."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,if Malaysia has stock for the New Matebook X pro new version...   i wonder if i buy from johor the warranty covers in singapore anot when its out in singapore.....  anyone buy from JB ?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"i check the max out spec from china is $13999 yuan approx 2.8k sgd..
i7/16/1tb model....    how ui get 2.2k"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Sorry bro 8gb ram
The store I got from max specs was only this"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Hi which forwarder or agent you use to buy laptop from USA? Do you have to pay gst or smth?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Hi which forwarder or agent do you use?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"You can get it in Malaysia Huawei shop. Johore Paradim has one.
But in general, repair person don't have good comment with Huawei notebook."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Hi all,
Need some help here please.. I'm looking to buy the 2018 MateBook X Pro i7. There are some at Carousell, lowest around SGD1950. Amazon is selling at USD1380 inc of shipping and fees which is around SGD1875.
Any problems or add on fees if I chose to buy from amazon? If there are issues, I wud rather buy from carousell. I assume they are selling the US version also right? Or are they better sites to buy from? Be it local or from US?
Really appreciate if anyone can help."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"1380*1.4 about 1.36 * 1.03 credit card = closer to sgd 1950. the shipping and fees included GST, you dont have to pay extra.
From carouhell is new?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Yes. BNIB.
If that's the case, might as well buy from carousell. Just wanted to ask cause I saw some got it from the states for around just below USD1200. But I'm not sure from which platform though."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"The Matebook is coming to Singapore. Those that haven't purchased, should wait out for the it show. Unfortunately, the x pro isn't here yet; only the Matebook 13."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Yup, At least find out what the pricing is and decide which is better subject to personal criteria"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Pricing is already out.
In my opinion, this is very cheap, especially considering what else is being offered in Singapore."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Frankly, im a little worried about Huawei laptops"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Hijacking this thread, anyone know where I can get the Honor Magicbook with an AMD processor ?
It's so hard to find a retailer and aliexpress sellers aren't glowing with good reviews either."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Here's hoping the SG models come with touch screens. Otherwise the prices are still a bit higher than what you can find in China.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,I m selling...pm me
Huawei Matebook X Pro,? i already got mine.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Matebook 13 battery is mediocre though. Rather they bring matebook 14
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"This isn't a buy/sell thread, guys. Please keep those out of this thread.
Thanks."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Matebook X pro looks really attractive. I almost go for it!
But then, now the US-CN sager. IMO, it better to hold back purchase until they make news that Microsoft do support Huawei laptops in the long run."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,How many built-in features are we losing if we were to reinstall Windows OS and not to install any Huawei drivers or their PC manager software?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Launch in Singapore has been postponed.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,MateBook 13 sale in pc show is postponed as well?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Dont think its coming already. After google android ban, Microsoft windows should be next. Lucky this was before SG start selling the matebook. If not surely a lot of refund / return"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Definitely a no-no to purchase this. Once Microsoft withdraw the licence for Huawei to utilise Windows OS, the laptop will be considered running pirated OS, which if used in SMEs, can lead to a lot of fines or penalties"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Good opportunity to buy cheap for home use though haha. Imagine matebook x pro resale price as people get rid of them or retailer clearing stocks
2011 HP fire sale anyone ?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"here we go...
Microsoft removes Huawei laptop listings from its online store"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Just when I thought of getting the latest model. Any alternative that can compete with huawei in terms of spec and weight?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,dell xps lor or asus zenbook...
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Mod edit: Ad removed
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Will avoid previous gen MateBook X Pro.. If you read online, many units suffer from loose trackpad and overheating.. High temperature destroys electronics earlier. And the lack of warranty in Singapore may be a concern.. Furthermore, the Huawei USA saga.. Better to wait for more clarity.. I think Huawei recognised the overheating problem and changed the fan design for the 2019 model."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Huaweis pending MateBook X Pro and Matebook 13 launch in Singapore up in the air
Huawei Matebook X Pro,potential Windows ban is coming to matebook.
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Wonder if they will still sell at next week PC show??
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Wish they would, maybe even give discount to clear stock. Some would still buy due to matebook hardware / price ratio. Not everyone overly concerned with US ban, can always install Linux if need be."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,Maybe can email Huawei sg to ask
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I asked the sales staff at the Huawei booth in CEE. The guy said tentatively the laptops are on hold pending further decision from the senior management.
I'm planning to snag one in China."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,*Huawei still can  do OS update or not ?
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"I dun hv such issues
The only issue I hv is the charging brick.
only the HW charging brick works for me
Using 3rd party 60w ones like ugreen n other brands gave me 'not charging' Or at best, intermittent charging"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"You should try the one I'm using. So far no problems with charging. I've been using it since January, 5 days a week, no problem. It's only 48w but works just fine. I don't notice any slow charging or anything like that, despite it being only 48w. Bonus is, there's a second USB A port to charge other stuff concurrently. Just to note. I'm using this charger, but the USB C cable, I still use the Huawei one that's included. If you're having problems with PD chargers not charging your laptop, it could be a cable problem, and not so much a charger problem.

thanks for any info you can offer"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"not hard.
but need patience..
Warranty confirm void if u have cos need to peel off the sticker.
I not sure about ithers but for mine.
1. unscrew the base screw, rubber feet inside got no screw. so dont bother to remove it.
2. cover the cover and u will see one tiny sticker covering ssd screw.
3. Normally I use Hp to take a picture of the screw positing in case i forget and placed it in order on paper as how it looks like on PCB board. Use a scotch tape to tape it if you scare u misread or move it
4. Unscrew the ssd screw and move in the ssd.
If too tight, I will remove some of the other screw slowly.
5. Since u already open, check ur display hinges too as it will become loosen after time.
SSD screw is on the middle right of the photo
This Video got teach u how to remove, but I scare, so I remove some and slowly slot back."

Does the one in Malaysia comes with touch?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Anybody can help to check what's the current price that is retailing in jb now? For the i7 version.
Sent from Samsung SM-G973F using GAGT"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Just curious, people who are getting the 2019 version>
1. So far I saw still no updates that it will come to SG
2. other then google, OS such as Microsoft windows, and Office is not an issue to run on this machine
Am I right about above?"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"The Huawei laptops have been put on hold, in terms of the official store bringing it into Singapore. You can still get them via other means.
All those are highly politicised actions. Any effect will most likely only be short-lived, so you don't need to worry so much about any long term effects.
Also, apart from certain places stopping sale of Huawei products, for existing users, any of those actions will only prohibit support of existing productsmore importantly, in the form of future updates. So if you already have a matebook x pro, even if there's a permanent blanket ban in the US, your matebook won't suddenly cannot boot, or unable to open your Microsoft Office documents. So, basically, not that big of a deal if you're a normal user."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"went jb huawei store inquire
no ready stocks for matebook x pro, must order
but prices same , rm4999 for i5, 6999 sgd2333 for i7
both are 2018 models"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"At that price, it's an amazing deal, even for the 2018 model. I'm thoroughly satisfied with my purchase. Been using it since September last year, on almost daily basis. No issues whatsoever. Very fast device."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"i tend to agree too, 2333 is good price
u can even hunt on amazon and ebay and get one under 2k with shipping & taxes
im holding out for the 2019 models, also no real need to buy at the moment."
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"going to China, can buy from there and use in Sg? want to get the x pro 2019 model"
Huawei Matebook X Pro,I think malaysia version better
Huawei Matebook X Pro,guys finally managed to get my hands on one..wife bought it from China..after some modifications its working like a charm!
Huawei Matebook X Pro,"Is Matebook Pro X going to sell in Singapore as last heard that USA have lift the ban for Microsoft to continue selling their product to Huawei.
Anyway, with or without Windows in Matebook is not a problem, just need the laptop..."

Hoping to receive some feedback on the laptop if possible. Think i'm getting over the weekend"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Any bros here have review on this lappy?
@Extremme
: I'm looking at the same config, and want to add memory so total 16GB
So far not possible. If want 16GB can't get 7200 rpm Hard drive under the customise option
: The blue backlight can turn on and off?
: Is there Optane memory?
@petshijie
: Are there eCoupons? I didn't see"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I'm also considering this as worth well, but problem is gtx 1050 may not last long for future gaming. It barely can make it for modern gaming liao. But for light and old games, should be OK ba. I thinking of whacking the aftershock apex lite.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yeah for gtx 1050 it isn't meant for gaming at high performance but rather games that I don't mind set it in low quality maybe dota, csgo, apex legend?. I'm using it mainly for schoolwork so I think this is just nice, besides I have a desktop meant for gaming already. I won't really wanna game on a 15.6 inch laptop
maybe occasionally play haha.
Anyway apex lite is another pricing tier already. If you have budget for it, I think just go for it! But bear in mind they don't really have discounts on their website, such as coupon code, shopback and CC rebate cash is cheaper apparently.
Erm there's this popup on their website that ask me sign-up to their newsletter. I just provide email and spin the wheel, they gave me code. Can get up to $100 off. Maybe try looking around their website for the popup?
Still hoping to get reviews on this laptop too!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"@petshijie
: Nope. No popup on their website. Btw, I've pm-ed you.
: Found this review on youtube
@Hayate84
: I'm using the laptop mainly for work and light gaming.
Maybe I don't need GTX1650 after all
Anyone knows where I can get this machine L340 gaming, i7 with 16GB memory?
The standard one is with 8GB. No option to up memory so far.
Customize option don't have 7200 rpm Hard drive.
Battery life is important for me, so I prefer L340 gaming est. 9hrs over Legion Y540 est 5hrs"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Gaming laptop I think can only dim back light but not off.
for graphic I chose gtx 1650. I am mainly letting my son ply fortnite, PUBG etc"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Hmmm i not sure if the customised option is providing you the gaming version but i can pick i7 with 16gb on it. Yeah the customised option doesn't have 7200rpm hard drive. I probably go with the SSD instead.
Anyway thanks for pm-ing. i replied you there.
Can anyone enlighten me with the difference between this two regarding SSD? whether TLC or not is better?

Also does anyone know how to toggle with this? between quick and quiet mode?
""The IdeaPad L340 has two distinct modes: ‘Quick’ for gaming and ‘Quiet’ for working. Each mode looks, feels, and acts differently. Simply flick between the two based on what you need to do."""

I went to check out the stores yesterday to see the machine.
Not available yet at Best Denki. Called Challenger, they say don't have.
Anyone went down to CEE yet? There have?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Anyone knows the ecoupon for Lenovo? I thought I saw something like CEE*** 2 days ago but there doesn't seem to be any listed on their L340 or other product pages now.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Still can't figure out how to toggle quick and quiet mode. Google also not much help in this case. Might have to call their technical team tomorrow

Cost me $1097 after eCoupon, think after shopback 9% if successful not too sure because apply eCoupon might not pass shopback? my final spending is $998? Less than 1k for this really sweet deal for me. Hoping it arrives within next week.
Oh yeah, not forgetting CC rebates for shopping. Really good"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"L340 Build your own does not have 7200RPM Harddrive option.

7200 RPM Harddrive + 8GB RAM
or
5400 RPM Harddrive + 16GB RAM"

Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"It's not stated if they're giving you 1x16GB or 2x8GB if you order 16GB RAM but either way there's not much real world difference. I would take 16GB over the 7200RPM drive because if they give you 2x8GB, at least you're getting a matched pair rather than you having to source a single 8GB should you want to upgrade in future. 2.5"" 7200RPM are plentiful and prices look to drop as time goes by.
Just checked: Dynacore SRP for WD Black 1TB 7200RPM 2.5"" is $129"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yeah agreed. Buying Ram is much better than drive since it's unknown about 1 or 2 ram stick they're putting. If I'm not wrong, shopee has good tech deals on the drive. Just look out for it if you aren't urgent.
I pm you instead! Check your inbox"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Can those who got their laptops post some real life photos?
this model is so new that no one did an actual review on it yet 😣 would be good if you guys can provide some comments on the performance with the i7 model and if it thermal throttle"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"oh and does anyone know if the battery ia different between the customisable option and the pre configured version?
the customisable one is 3 cell cylindrical smt, 45wh? the pre configured one is 3cell lipo or smt iirc.. its advertised up to 9 hrs of battery life which is almoat impossible with just 45wh.."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I suspect as long as it is L340 gaming customise, the battery and shell is the same as the pre-configured machines.
I've checked and if you are on the page with L340 gaming and click the option to customise, you won't get the optical drive that comes with L340 non-gaming machine.
They should have just labelled the customise option as L340 gaming customise."

I'll just get what is available without too much trouble.
Lovely if I have the time to customise a machine myself.
Maybe in the future. Totally ideal, can put in whatever i want"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I don't see it anywhere that mention ODD on the l340 gaming page. Hmm yeah they should just put all the model there as L340 gaming  and not cause confusion to customers. Anyway best to chat up with their agent for better clarification.
There's not much to customise for laptop, especially if you still want to retain warranty by the manufacturer. Would best to do that once you past the warranty period.
Once i received my laptop, i will post some photos and a quick review here. Mine isn't the i7 model and i not sure if i will experience with thermal throttle newbie at setting it but i will try gaming it for awhile, maybe on mid-specs just to see what's my frame rate like on FPS game
Edit: Just got notified that my cashback is recorded. $98 from that 9% cashback. Luckily didn't go down CEE show for the laptops."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"You can google PSREF L340-15IRH to see the spec.
16GB max offering / 2400MHz DDR4, optional 4GB memory soldered to systemboard, one DDR4 SO-DIMM socket"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I see.. cos for the l340 gaming laptop model page where you can choose pre configured models or customise your own parts, the battery is labelled differently so i thought of asking here to see if anyone knows abt it haha"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Nice cashback! Able to stack with lenovo's promocode? the one you get with the spin at their page?
thanks for the photos and review in advance
tho probably will get before end of the 9% cashback ends"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"seems like you guys were right, the battery is the same capacity no matter if its preconfigured or customised.. according to the specs sheet, its 45wh. Dk how lenovo got to 9hrs battery life for a laptop with 45wh battery. with its i7 model i am hoping for at least 2 hours of editing or at least 4 hours of light work"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Wow thanks for finding that out! They should put this up on the product page so its easier to reference from.
Yeah, I applied eCoupon lenovo promo code first and with shopback cashback turn on. Anyway i got better discounts from lenovo chat agent rather than the spin wheel. You should chat up with them and see if they can provide you with discounts. Credits to intel888 bro from telling me!
9 hrs is the maximum battery life that the computer can hold under everything setting to lowest brightness, the minimum program running on memory, etc . i7 core runs at higher performance and eats up more since it has 2 more core than the i5 though not at a noticeable rate but ideally if you're gaming this could make a really small slight difference.
I believe anywhere between 1.5 to 2 hours for heavy programs game, vid edit and 4 to 5 hours of normal work should be okay."

Well but it has a function for rapid charging.
My son tried to use it to play Fortnite and he was complaining that he can only turn the graphic to medium or something else it will lag. Ok I am not a pro..last time when I was young, I dont even use gaming laptops.  Maybe I did not turn on the gaming mode which I dont even know how to do that."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"PMed you!
This is the exact same config I am planning to get, tho I am still considering between the 1050 or 1650.. am afraid that the 1650 will produce more heat and then the whole system will thermal throttle in this relatively thin chassis."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Ya, the heat was my concern too. So I chose 1050 to play safe.
Have replied your PM."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"What's the effect of thermal throttle may I know? I also wish to get 1650...
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"thermal throttling basically mean that the cooling system of the laptop is not able to dissipate the heat generated by the components in the laptop and the cpu/gpu gets so hot to the point where it runs at a lower clock speed in order to generate less heat and run cooler.
hence you are not able to get the full performance the laptop and its components can offer."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Noted about this. But how do we know which kind of laptop is capable of disatting heat effectively?
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Hi can pm me the code as well?

Decided to go for the 1650 to future proof it alittle because i dont change my laptop for about 3 to 4 years at least.
Last but not least. Thanks Intel888 for the info on getting the good deal."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,How much cost for this setup?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"check your inbox i pmed
Nice! Initally i wanted to get your setup but then again i don't think i will need better specs for my com if i'm using mostly for school work. How much did you spend? Got use shopback or not"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"My set up cost $1590.88 before discount.
After discount, the actual price is really lower and it’s really worth it to get it.
I still remember my old Asus ROG gaming laptop cost $2699 four years ago!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I read up 1650 was the newer version of the 1050. But I know nothing much about PC nowadays.
I’m using it for work and secretly playing some games during work. LOL
Yes I did used the shopback! Not sure when they will credit in.
Edit :  I just calculated my actual cost and discount price between the two graphic card, it is only $111 different! 😯"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yea the new graphic card is slightly better in terms of performance of games, and holds 1gb more. Haha you have the same mindset as me, work mainly and game while have the chance.
Damn, maybe i should have pulled the trigger for 1650 graphic card. oh well."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Who knows the thermal throttling could limit this new card.
Just like how my old Asus laptop’s gfx cars kaput twice after playing apex legend for 1 hour."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Was looking at which L340 option to buy.
The graphic card between the customize and gaming option seems a bit different, like 1GB different, not sure got other diff anot.
customize - NVIDIA GeForce GTX1050 3GB GDDR5 96bit
gaming - NVIDIA GeForce GTX1050 4GB GDDR5
Any idea what is the different between the 2 S$1199 option? So far what I can see is the SSD different 256GB vs 128GB."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"When your laptop arrive, can share how it works when you play legend?
My current 7 yr old Lenovo cannot handle legend even if nothing else is running. The whole keyboard gets super hot.
But then, this grand dame also cannot handle multiple files Internet tabs, Pdfs, Word, etc. without heating up
I scared the new L340 also will heat up, so I get GTX1050 3GB to play safe.
But then the L340 has a whole row of vents at the bottom. Could help ventilate."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"My shopback successful email came a few hours after I placed the order.
Maybe you can file claim with shopback if you don't see it soon."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Sure will do!
I don’t expect high setting, but at least Low to Med comfortably.
As far as I know, my old laptop uses one from mobo and one dedicated gfx card.
When performing light work, it’s very seamless, but when gaming on dedicated gfx card, the whole laptop is like a rocket. Loud fan blowing.
It’s gona be very interesting for this laptop given at this price point. Comparing all other brands at least $2k above.
Did receive the shopback notification but still pending.
Btw your order shipment out already?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I suppose won't kaput so fast la. After all they define it as gaming laptop, i'm sure it will work it out if you put low / mid settings.
I talked to the agent about this, but got brushed it off saying the pre-configured comes in that way. Either way if you like the pre-configured version, feel free to get that one.
and your 2nd point, yeah seems like it's only the SSD. But i think you best ask the agent about it.
Yeah i got the email from shopback saying it's tracked with the amount too. My order shipment for those 10c $1 is otw while the laptop isn't."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yeah, think i am also going with everything max out except the graphics card, leaving it at 1050 just to be safe. Gonna be used primarily for video editing.
@whatme and @intel888 should do the same benchmark to see if it will thermal throttle since the other specs are the same haha!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I'll try to see if will thermal throttle when I get my machine.
@whatme and @petshijie, just checked the tracking, my shipment label for accessories just created on UPS. Send to Sg from Hongkong!
I thought it is from Sg warehouse."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"How about the laptop? Is it still not yet shipped out?
For my order, the mouse created shipping label, despite yesterday ordered only. kind of weird to see all ship individually"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Just completed my order with the same specs as @Intel888. Looking forward! Shopback recorded the transaction too. Hope shipping and everything will go smoothly hehe
Lenovo Ideapad L340,May I know the price after discount?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"All my accessories except for 1 mouse mat has shipped out. Laptop is still processing. Yeah i realise all of them ship individually and probably gonna receive them 1 by 1... Doesn't matter to me as long they come.
My guess is that this laptop deal is too good that alot of people order it from here and elsewhere
Now we just have to wait. Have to thank TS for opening a thread for this laptop haha."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"After the discount is $1352, haven’t deduct shopback rebate too.
Perhaps if successful rebate to my account. It will be $1230 .
At this price, where to get?!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,You mean people ordering from other places instead?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Now the 15% discount is available to everyone, dont have to chat with the operator le, there's a chance to get 15% off using the spin wheel popup. 😬"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,I dont think anywhere else is selling it tho.. Called up lenovo bugis to ask if there's any display unit to try out but the rep said it's not available in any physicsl stores in sg.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I meant like in other countries, since their laptop is built elsewhere before they ship to singapore so everyone is buying just like us here. Just my guess :p
Nice! Spam the wheel till you get 15% discount!
Yeah think it's too new already. Eager to wait for mine to arrive. The feeling is like you're one of the first few people to get the laptop before market release haha"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"The spinning wheel only entitled once, would have cut time to speak to the chat agent though..
I don’t know why I got a strong feeling Lenovo actually marks up a lot too"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Cheapest in Singapore, JB and some say Batam"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Now we have four of us owning this laptop soon, we will able to provide some reviews for others who is considering a Low Budget gaming laptop 😛"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I've called up a few places too so that I could see the machine myself, but they don't have it yet. The Best Denki guy called some supposedly Lenovo rep when I was at the store, and told me that the physical laptop will arrive in the store in around 2 weeks.
If you are familiar with Ideapad, should be ok to order this without 'feeling it'.
Keyboard feel should be similar.
I could be wrong, but to me Thinkpad keyboard feels a tad different.
Yeah, nice to know that we are getting our hands on this before mass release"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"So weird that I received a sms notification that someone gona deliver on Friday.
“Dear Customer,
I'm on behalf of Lenovo arranging delivery of your Lenovo Ideapad on Friday 31 may between 9AM to 5PM.
Please reply to confirm delivery by 4.30pm.
Thank you”
I think it is the accessories only 🤣"

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I have a question. For those who get the customised version. I realise that the model is l340 instead of l340 gaming. So if we select the keyboard back-lit. Is it blue color as portray in the l340 gaming? Generally is l340 custom outlook the same as they portray the l340? I do note that there are normal l340 ideapad which is not the gaming edition... That's my worry

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"On a side note. How the coupon work is, u have to confirm your cart then supply them with your email and name, they will generate the code for you, but it is valid only for 5-7 mins and is one time only. So gotta firm up your mind first before asking for codes from operator.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"There’s the standard version of L340 at another Lenovo catalogue, which it has different colour variants.
However for gaming, customised one will look the same as the gaming version?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,A bit different for me. The CSO gave me code via Live Chat when I was ready to order.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I hope the customised one will look the same as the gaming version.
CSO told me it's the same. Hopefully it's true.
I prefer the gaming version - Blue logo on lid, and blue backlit keyboard. Nice!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yes I like that too. I'm just afraid the customise one may look different since they got non keyboard back light option...

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Hi,
I am interest in purchasing this as well. May I know from those who have purchased this laptop whether does the Lenovo store online accept installments.
Additionally, may I also know the actual battery life of the laptop as well?
Thank you"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Would be disappointing if it came out silver as the standard version. LOL.
But I think the gaming version has a better and larger cooling vent right?
My items all shipped out except the laptop too."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Just received the laptop sling bag and legion backpack. That’s so crazy. Why wouldn’t they ship all at once haha
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"trying to customize it, but cant seem to find the option for 16gb ram and 512gb ssd? anyone can advise?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I think the 16gb ram option was available for i7 configuration.
I just noticed my order page, the laptop expected to ship was changed to earlier date.  Anyone had that too?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Not right, My order configuration is i5, 16 GB, 512 Pcie NVME, GTX1650.
Canceled Ram 4GB onboard then 16 GB option  will available."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"ok, problem solved. Once I selected the i7 upgrade, the options became available. After that just need to scroll back up to switch back to the i5 chip and viola!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Ok guys! Those who order around the same time as me 28 May should see their laptop shipped out liao.
Mine shipped out from China"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"hey, i've also been looking at this laptop. seems like it's the best value for money out there, and it looks good also.
i am just wondering if it'll thermal throttle, and if the battery can go at least 4h. hope to read your reviews when you receive your items"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Received my backpack and mouse today.
Shipping details says items originated from Hongkong, then shipped to Taiwan, Shenzhen, then Sg. Merry-go-round
Laptop just shipped out at 10pm today from Hefei, China. Can't see yet if it will merry-go-round.
HDMI cable pending shipping. Wonder from where
No wonder the physical stores don't have the laptop yet.
Stocks all still in country of origin."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yup same i received 2 backpack, 1 toploader and mouse. My mouse mat and laptop otw to SG. Hopefully laptop can reach SG on sunday then I can try out
Parts made in china, nothing surprising
Anyway whichever users that are keen in purchasing this laptop, get it soon! The sales will be over by sunday 11:59pm.
And i realise, lenovo giving away tablet when spend above 2k in single receipt! Though doesn't really apply to everyone who buys here because will be less than 2k but if buying 2 laptops or people don't mind sharing can consider it!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Ordered mine on 25th May - with the same configuration as yours except for warranty upgrade which I am not sure if you did, and if it may affect order-to-delivery time.
Contacted CS on 28th for update, and was replied with no update from plant, BUT promised an ""update within the day"". Until today still no update, and expected to ship date delayed to 3rd June.
Upon a check online, I see a handful of posts with delayed Lenovo order, some for months. Hoping that this is not the case with mine.
Anyway, I sent another email on 31st May to pester them for clarification haha. Will update here if there is any problem or nothing serious."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Wow sounds bad, I do heard about very late shipment for Lenovo laptop such as the E495 ThinkPad.
But I did not extend my warranty, I’m wondering why would they delay your shipment for a extend warranty? Is it because they will build a more “durable” part inside? So it will last thru your warranty period? Lol..
Perhaps it’s just some logistic problem which it doesn’t flow when warranty is extended."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Looks like it's no big deal after all. Received shipment notification yesterday afternoon.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I was browsing Facebook and saw the Aftershock promotion.
With their Forge 15, their basic spec looks very similar with this Lenovo gaming laptop.
Price point also around $1385 for the gtx1050 while $1485 for the gtx1650
What I customised in Lenovo, cost $1550 without 15% discount.
If we compare on price, the Lenovo laptop I customised of $1350 less 15% will beat the $1385 aftershock in terms of the graphic card? Any others?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Aftershock design seemed nicer especially if u are into rgb keyboard. The forge got 15 color to choose, although it's only 1 layer. And I think cooling elements in forge is better in my opinion. Other than that, probably sama sama. I'm seriously looking for the apex lite due to its rgb keybaod and 1.89kg light weight.. Only.
I can relate to this. I have been struggling between aftershock and levenovo laptop for past 2 weeks. Today is the last day of the promotion. I still can't make up my mind. It seemed I am baring more to aftershock at the moment not deal to specs, but deal to I like their design better... Hmmm

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Shyt, I realise today is last day of sale. But lenovo operator doesn't operate on weekends. How to ask for 15% discount code sia?? Gg liao...
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Now the answer is pretty straight that you should get the aftershock instead 😂
Perhaps you should visit the fair now to try it out."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Don't worry, go to lenovo home page. There will be a popup for their spin the wheel and you can get 15% discount. You have to fill up your email first then can spin the wheel. Can easily get 15% discount if you know the trick :p
Let me pm you on that
Edit: Side note, my estimated delivery for laptop is on 6th june. The parcel got from Hefei -> Shanghai -> korea. I wonder why have to go through so many transit..."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"But the waiting time for apex 15 lite is 6-8 weeks, according to the people at the fair"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I got it! Thanks. I think the codes works for everybody. Pm me of you need.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Hey, do you mind pm-ing me the code? I'm not sure if I could pm you. Apparently, I need to post 10 posts. I'm new to this place, sorry"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Wow that’s a long wait!
Yes, I think our laptop is in the same shipment. It went Korea :/"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Btw those who got the lenovo laptop, anyone could verify if the 9% shopback rebates worked?
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Shopback managed to tracked but they will only release the funds when Lenovo has acknowledged we receive the laptop and has not return back to them.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"So you mean shopback already recognised the 9% rebate for your entire purchase? I understand it take 2 to 3 months for the rebates to be in.
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yes, it was tracked after 30min of my purchase."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Cool. I've decide to get the l340 over the aftershock after all. Cheers!
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yay 😀
Finally! But what makes you suddenly decide?
I couldn’t find out how does the L340 cool down this system tho ."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I found out about the ventilation for this laptop.
Apparently one is on the center of the hinge of laptop there, and there's one big long ventilation right at the bottom of the laptop.
Taking into this consideration, i suggest to get a cooling pad for this laptop especially for long hours gaming. And also after shutting down the laptop, try not to close the laptop lid immediately to let some air out from the ventialation at the hinge there.
I will try and see how it works when i get the laptop.
And yeah, shopback 9% cashback is real. first time getting like $100 for my cashback worth lol although it's now tracked and not release yet. And my CC rebate makes this buy worth. Deals ends today so better get it!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Lol Guess what! The shipment went USA now, I wonder how many times it will transfer before reaching SG"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Becuase practicalness overcomes my desire for design /outlooks lol.
Exactly same specs.
$1250 vs $1550. Save $300 makes more sense to me haha...

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Finally made my purchase. Hope a goes well, how you guys track your order??
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"This acer is radeon tech. So abit hard to compare. For me, I still prefer Intel. And those acer nitro from shopback and Qoo10 lazada etc, are older ver laptop. Cheap probably due to clearance. I almost want to get a acer nitro 5 from q10 for $917 after cart discount. Really  very attractive. What pulled me away is it doesnt come with ssd which is a deal breaker for me. It is not customisable..

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"You'll receive notification when item is shipped.
Then click the provided link to track."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Mine probably same shipment as yours.
Tracking showed that laptop went from Hefei China, to Shanghai China, to Incheon Korea, then Anchorage United States. Now just left Anchorage to don't know where
World tour"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yes, on Youtuber mentioned about the vents too.
Do you have recommendation for cooling pad?
Important to get the design that does not push back the hot air into the vents."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Thanks. Figured it out. Damn. Some free items Oct 19 den ship out... Something wrong??
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"It went to Louisville Kentucky to eat KFC Liao.
Why so far"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"That's probably the mouse mat. Don't worry about it. They'll ship it to you when they have stock.
My mouse mat was expected to ship around Oct as well, arrived on 30th May."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Mine is still at korea... Estimated delivery on the 6/6. maybe need go world tour then receive it on the estimated date itself.
You're right, since the air vent is below then best not to get cooling pad to prevent hot air pushing back. in that case i probably look up on laptop stand instead since i'm moving around often.
I think can consider this cooling fan, it seems good but look bulky."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Same scheduled delivery date 6/6 as me except mine went to USA.
I guess this is their first shipment out to worldwide on this product.
Probably we are not looking for those cooling pad that are blowing air upwards right? I think a laptop stand will be good though?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Hmm I'm not in an urgent need but just hope they wouldn't delay till next week that's all.
Yup, the earlier link that i posted about laptop cooler fan is similar to this video i found online. You can have a look here:
If you're worried about hot air pushing back, here's what the video guy replied on one of the comment:
So yeah, i think this laptop cooler should work fine."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I got this specs

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Oh I didn’t know this laptop bottom pulls air and exit from the hinge. Looks useful.  Shall consider too!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Erm i'm not exactly sure if the laptop bottom pulls air in or push air out. Can only find out when the laptop arrive
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Anyway is your shipment still stuck at korea? For mine, still at Kentucky. Don’t know what they can do over there for so Long."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Mine has been chilling at Shanghai since 1/6. Arrival scan. No sign that it will depart from Shanghai yet.
The one in Kentucky is supposedly the UPS World Port, ""the center point of UPS's worldwide air network"", also their largest hub, so I think your package is good, though it is halfway across the world."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"But did they give you a scheduled delivery date?
Perhaps mine is the last country to clear liao"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Wah. The wait is as long as like waiting for a car shipment sia. Mine 17 june estimated delivery...

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Did your estimated delivery date get delayed from the estimated date at the time your order is placed?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"No actually this was the date when I placed the order...
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"They did, 7th June. Probably just waiting for more packages to ship together to other hubs."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Last tracked now is at clearance agency. Should be either at SG custom or waiting to clear at USA..
How about you guys?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Same here. My guess is Singapore since my last tracked is korea... can't be we both clearance at different country at the same timing.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Lol !! It went korea!
I Guess it will ship together with yours"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I think mine is same with your shipment.
It's back to Korea for kimchi after having chicken in US.
Now departed Korea for don't know where"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Do you think it will send to US to assemble some stuff into the laptop and then send back to SG? Or else I find it no reason to go back US and Korea
Lenovo Ideapad L340,2019聯想電腦美國組裝？可以買咧!!!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Once they sent it to UPS, they set the delivery location to your address, so it won't stop by Lenovo plant anymore. Wherever it goes in that time frame between shipped to delivered is up to UPS.
UPS Expedited has a longer time in-between, compared to Express, and it's up to UPS to use that time to lower the cost as much as possible.
I think your package along with other packages going to non-US with a longer delivery time is put together in the same cargo plane as other package going for US, and then return back to Korea, just to clear up some space in UPS warehouse. They can sell those warehouse spaces, from which they will probably earn more compared to the money they lost by loading up the empty spaces in the plane."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,So my parcel went from korea to shenzhen and now it's at changi! Hoping it can reach my hands by today then able to give review by tomorrow

Lenovo Ideapad L340,I checked the Lenovo order status page. It changed the expected to arrive date from 6 June to 4 June which it’s today. Hope you guys will receive today too!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"No problem! Hoping to have positive feedback on the laptop then let's see if we have different opinion
看了你两个选择后，你选IdeaPad L340-17IRH比较适合你玩PubG吃雞。主要是因为GPU在IdeaPad L340-17IRH是适合玩游戏的。Lenovo-IdeaPad-L340-17IWL它是用Integrated Graphics，就是你的Processor　GPU，不能玩游戏像是PubG, Dota。
你要买在Lenovo湾站的话，记得开Shopback拿。现在有７％Cashback。然后拿１５％折扣。但是这个你要和Lenovo代理人说你兴趣。这个你要找一位会英文来帮你吧！"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I agree with Geeky010. Think our laptops were part of a larger shipment.
Anyway, just saw that it's went back to Korea, then backtracked to Shenzhen.
Finally, it has landed in SG this morning."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Mine is still stated 6 June. Hmm ...
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Saw it depart Changi but no movement already, see how again.
Pretty exciting"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Wows it really is pretty exciting! Did you receive any sms abt the delivery like when they are delivering the accessories?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Did anyone order the mouse mat and got any updates on its status? Mine is expected to ship on 16 Oct..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yeah, mine was expected to ship around Oct as well.
The mat will be delivered once they have stock. Mine is shipped on 28th May, 3 days after ordering it."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Great! Would suck to have to wait that long just to receive a mouse mat
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"No notification for UPS but some items such as the backpack are delivered by Tiong Nam which they will me.
I received all accessories even the mouse mat already.
Still no news from UPS for the laptop. Low chance lo"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Hopefully UPS still deliver at night if not need to wait till thurs liao. Mine's expected to reach on 12june :/
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I just ordered mine last night, minimum 2 weeks wait for me but cant wait to see your reviews man!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yup guys, not here for today. Probably Thursday delivering.
Have to put the excitement aside. The mouse mat is really nice."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,HAHA mouse mat 😂 Glad i went with the mouse mat too
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yeah they're delivering on thursday... I received all accessories as well too, so it's just the laptop i'm eager to get it now"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,So far there isn’t anyone online who received their laptop right? Even USA or China? Like no reviews on YouTube too..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"My shipment shows that there is a 'Departure Scan' from SG this afternoon.
Hopefully my laptop is not going around the world again

There's a very brief review here. Posted this sometime ago"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Same here, I was very excited when I saw departure scan because my mouse mat was shipped by UPS. Once they depart Changi, it will change to “Singapore,Singapore Arrival Scan” which three hours later I received the mat, too bad it didn’t. Well enjoy tomorrow public holiday first!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"My laptop finally arrived at Changi this morning, though the delivery date is now pushed back to 8/6 instead."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Everyone is like so excited in this thread post. If it's tomorrow arriving i probably be able to test at night after my work. I'll give a short review probably before midnight.
Meanwhile, whoever received it can give reviews as well. Hope to contribute"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Same here, only can track it and feel happy when the laptop deliver to our home but can touch it after work.
Actually what we need to do first when we receive the laptop ah? I remember someone order before and he said the battery need conditioning or something"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I think one of our bros here have received quite long ago.
Wonder how is it now"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Oops....
Ok so I am not an expert in this area. Moreover its my first gaming laptop.
The good in short:
- The build of the laptop is good.
- The blue keyboard back light is nice and I am glad we have 3 options to turn it off, dim it and make it bright.
- My son used it to play fortnite and he is happy with it citing that he can play using the highest graphics etc BUT the power mode has to be turned on to performance mode first else it will lag apparently.
The bad:
- The battery life seems weak so whenever I am not plugged in, I will use the Safe Mode to make the best out of the battery life
- I emailed Lenovo several times asking them abt the ""Quiet"" and ""Quick"" mode because based on the website, it said its good for gaming and can be done by a simple ""flick"". Apparently alot of them cant really explain to me whats that. Almost all eventually told me its basically to configure the BIOS by adjusting the fan something like that. Read:
- I bet you have read this on some review. All the ports USB, USB-C, power etc are all on the non-traditional LEFT side of the laptop. So its abit weird or inconvenient.
Anymore questions you all have, let me know lor. Thks."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yeah usually it will be below 50% battery when you first receive it. What i tend to do is to drain the battery finish even when i get my new phone then leave to charge it overnight 6-8hours. I believe that is part of battery conditioning right?
I'll probably test around by doing both normal work and gaming, then i give both results to see how well is the laptop in terms of noise by the fan vents, keyboard feel etc."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Thank you bro for the insightful review. Totally appreciate it too!
I’m kind of disturbed by where is the work and quick mode that you are facing. Maybe because my main reason of getting this laptop is able to switch around.
Or they didn’t develop the software yet."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"One of my reasons was also becauze I thought I can switch around however all the customer services guys could only point me to the Bios configuration. One of them was even worst. He told me its the button which is actually the switch to close/block the camera  because if you look at the Lenovo website, the pic beside this feature is actually  the camera pic. He  Totally does not know his product at all."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I went to further research and found one of the review mentioned that Lenovo is still mysteriously brief about this mode but not yet confirm.
Maybe gotta wait lo.. anyway I think if we use power saving mode, high chance the laptop using onboard graphic card than the own graphic card. Same as my current Asus laptop"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"@extremme so far based on your usage, how long does the battery last? >1hr?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"It's weird that they put this function as one of the features, but it hasn't been developed yet? Does the manual book says anything?
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"@whatme: Same here. I hope to be able to switch around. That's why I titled this thread for work and light gaming
@Extremme: Thanks for the review. How long does the battery last when not gaming?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Looks like we can’t secretly game while working until they come out with it!! Lol
Once we all get our hands with the laptop. We shall send bunch of emails to the ask them again too."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Not even on gaming. I was only listening to spotify, normal surfing..my estimate is <3hrs on normal mode.
My son was playing Fortnite yesterday and he commented the laptop is getting hot. So I think I need to get a proper fan system like what some commented in the last few posts."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Yes we shd. I think we shd be asking the other regions' CSO too because the model was released much earlier in the US or UK I think so I am surprised there is not much discussion or complains on the net for those regions.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Less than 3 hours is really quite little. They should have doubled the battery capacity to 90wh and idm paying slightly more for it tho..
Wats ur screen's brightness level? Is your cpu the i7-9750H? Maybe can try to undervolt the cpu to allow it to run cooler and consume less battery, at least thats what I am going to try doing when I get mine"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"3hrs on normal mode is really little. I was expecting somewhere 5-6 hrs on normal usage... Is this on safe mode or performance mode? Perhaps you have many programs running that makes it <3hrs? I probably test out the battery over the weekend.
As for the laptop cooler, here's the link again. I might buy one if the laptop really gets hot on normal usage."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Shipment still on transit.
Morning no movement at all.."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yes my CPU is i7-9750H, display is GTX1060.  I am on safe mode.."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Not really actually. for now, I merely use it for normal surfing, desktop chats, and listening to music. The heat is generated when my son is playing game. For normal use, its really quiet and cool."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,What are your exact specs?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Can't wait to try out mine tonight. How's the fan vent? Does the vent come out from the bottom, then the hinge is the air intake or exhaust? Sorry i not good with the terms haha.
You only have SSD hard drive of 256gb? you probably need HDD. Anyway now they have $1 for 3 years upgrade. Remember to get shopback 7% cashback and apply 15% discount coupon from their spin wheel via their main website."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Exactly like mine right? Most probably gona use a fan to blow it temporarily if it’s gona be so hot.
See how again, tonight will try it"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Sorry bro, I’m also working now, can’t wait to get home to try Apex Legends hahaha"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Oh. Sorry, I got ssd 512gb, no hdd. Well, I bought last week during pcshow. So I didn't got the 3 year upgrade
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,I should have gotten the 3 years warranty too. Don’t know how reliable is Lenovo
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Haha no one expected after 2nd june that lenovo will have this promo. But it seems like you have to spin the wheel to get the 10c upgrade 3 years warranty.
I checked the 10c upgrade to 3 years when configuring the warranty setting, seems like you really have to get the code. Most likely the 10c upgrade 3 years will come in a code to insert when you check out. So will it overwrite the 15% discount? Not sure but people who are getting it can try spinning the wheel."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Display : 17.3"" FHD 1920x1080, LED Backlight, IPS, 300nits, Anti-glare
GOOD PRICE?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Unlikely the promo code will not stack with the 15% discount as I tried entering the $5 off too.
How Long is the standard warranty ah?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"One year only. Which is very short.
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"After the 15% discount, you won't find any brand with similar spec for that price checked CEE and IT Show, ended up buying from Lenovo Online lol. So yes, it's a good price."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Looks like my laptop won't arrive today. The ground delivery is scheduled for this Saturday, eventhough the hub is like 2km away from my place.
Checking with UPS CS if I can just collect on my own instead. If not, grounded at home whole Saturday also not a solution.
Looking forward to your reviews."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Haven't received mine yet, even though the tracking showed that the scheduled delivery is today. Hmm ..."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"So far my current Lenovo Ideapad has lasted me 7 years until it started acting funny. Still can do stuff but sometimes Internet access disappears, re-enable network adapter will hang. When it utter mad mood, then will not boot up
The grand dame not designed for gaming, so will heat up when gaming. IMO, still can use for unimportant things like surfing the net. For work, better not.
My workplace Lenovo Thinkpad never give problems. Just can't stand the red knob my personal preference.
So far, in my experience, Lenovo has outlasted in terms of years before act funny Sony, Fujitsu, Toshiba 2 models.
Hope this Lenovo L340 gaming will live up to my expectations!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Nice! I'm also looking forward!
Please share reviews when ready"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Wow I have received all my accessories. Now left laptop itself. It has also been shipped ahead of schedule.
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Those who will be receiving the laptop soon might also check the seal is it half pry open anot. So weird
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Yeah same thing. Went down to PC show to get a laptop but ended up buying from lenovo online instead after checking the prices. Quite surprising as you would think pc show will be cheaper for the specs plus some stock clearing but here we have a brand new self-customised model being cheaper.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yeah I'm glad to find this thread before heading down to the CEE show as I was looking around for a recommendation for laptop. Until i saw shopback available and initially found $100 then became 15% discount, became too hard to resist and i ended up getting it. Saved my time to go CEE and IT show.
My UPS delivery guy came today, but unfortunately nobody at home. So probably tomorrow will get it, but i wont be home till late. I leave the review to saturday then"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"For my case, I went from pc show to check out aftershock laptops. Seemed like they only give better promos if you getting the top range slate or above models. Tried to get an upgrade of apex lite to 16 gb. But still need a top up. I don't think can get discount so easily liao. So in the end chose to buy lenovo online liao lor. Overall cheaper somemore.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Powering up this Monster now. I like the IPS panel haha!
Cant really test it today because of alot of things to set up tonight.
Looks like the software are being updated before its shipped out. Maybe the Lenovo team open this laptop to install some important software before handing over.
But the keyboard layout is weird. Everything to the left, to the left. LOL"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"My machine arrived just before 10pm - UPS guys sure are working late.
Just got it set up -  Very fast and seamless.
So far it is quiet.
Heats up a bit when I try out Legend via Bluestacks, but gaming was smooth. No lag.
Graphics ok but I think my tablet is a bit sharper.
To me there is a slight yellow tint compared to my tablet.
Battery 50% drained out after around 45 minutes set up and 5 min gaming
It is idle now ready to use and charging, and the keyboard feels a bit warm.
Don't feel the air coming out of the vents below.
Anyone knows if there is a way to optimise the fan?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I felt the exhaust is blowing towards the monitor leh
Kind of noisy if you put it at performance mode.
I’m trying to figure the work mode now lol"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yes. According to YouTube review. Exhaust is on the blue panel ontop of the keyboard. It is blowing towards the screen. Which is somewhat worrying
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"After playing graphic intensive Apex Legends, can feel the heat coming from the vent at the hinge. The bottom ventilation is definitely the intake already.
Either you have a ceiling fan in your room to dissipate the heat, or else have a table fan to blow the heat off. Should be ok. Monitor in front doesn't feel hot.
Battery going fast..."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"what settings could you play it on? what specs was the specs you got? also, what is the battery life for just basic internet browsing?
thanks man, for helping us review this"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I merely tried it on the Medium setting first, reasonable warm but framerate wouldnt that bad. I think can handle high with some items off.
Battery life shown on the laptop is 4 hours only. Perhaps we have to continue using it for a long time so that they can predict our usage longer.
You can refer back to first few pages we shared among our specs. I chosen the  highest i7 processor and gtx configuration.
As i typing this review, the laptop on power saving mode is really quiet and seamless like what Intel888 has mentioned."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"lol 4 hours only. on the lenovo website, they said 9 hours. probably dimmed the display to the lowest setting and used airplane mode"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"See how again, its like the predicted hours of usage keep on changing. Im using the second lowest brightness and I find it comfortable already.
Im browsing the lenovo software support page to look for the work and quick mode.. nah.. no chance.
Where is the flick!!! lol"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yeah, I couldn't find the said flick too.
Add on to my review:
The sound system is ok. Played some music.
Didn't see the equalizer for the default music and video player.
Guess have to download a player that has an equalizer.
Regarding the noise. I don't know why but I can hear it now and then.
I think it is the fan. Think the fan only runs when the heat goes above a certain threshold. After some time, the fan auto switched off, and no sound at all."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Haha I have been searching for the flick for freaking almost a month. Gave up haha
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Oh if the bottom vent is the intake, then the previous laptop cooler link i gave should help. In fact i think any laptop cooler should work. Thanks for your quick review!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"May I know what are the implications that if a laptop overheats? And what are the signa we should look out for? Sorry, pretty noob in these things.
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I would have no idea too, previously laptop graphic card tio kaput because of gaming too.
Perhaps it was my bad cos I didn’t provide good cooling environment too.
But sounds like the laptop cooler is definitely useful now. Going to bring it to workplace today and see how far I can stretch the battery"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"the one you recommended, is it big huh? dont think I will use it but more for my son lor..."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I not sure as i don't have it. But judging from the youtube video
, i think the size is like those 1 litre milk carton. If your son doesn't bring out the laptop you can consider getting 1."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Can try to undervolt the cpu so that it will produce lesser heat and use less power but at the same time have maintain the same performance if not more!
There are lots of tutorials online showing how to undervolt the i7-9750H, won't be too difficult. I think its a great first step before getting the laptop cooler"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Instead of under volting it, can we just game it with a lower performance mode?
Looks like there are like four variations.
From Best Battery / Better Battery - Balance - Better Performance / Performance mode.
I can’t rmb is it right anot.
The Lenovo vantage app is it useful anot ah?
Got many bloatwares sia, got candy crush inside also..."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,I find it pretty useful at least to me. It help tracks all the system updates etc.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I feel the more we need Lenovo to tell us about the ""Flick"" about Quiet and Quick mode."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Can also, just that the experience might not be that great as compared to best performance plus undervolting 😝"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yeah, not sure what does their Quiet or quick mode do to the system. Might be something that's really useful or just 2 different modes where the fans spin at a different speed LOL. Got a feeling the ""each mode looks, feels and acts differently"" is just for advertising purposes tho ofc i hope not too :/"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Does anyone still have the 3 years warranty promotion code?
Trying my luck to enter it now via vantage app. lol!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,the promo code can be used after purchase? I thought have to buy the warranty when making purchase hahaha
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Thats what i thought, you can access additional service via lenovo vantage and it brings you to extended warranty page. Im curious... lol"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"In my experience with my old laptop, when it overheats, it hangs.
Not sure if it contributed to the other problems I had with it - blue screen, cannot start up, network adapter disappeared and system hang when re-enable.
For my old laptop, the problems could also be a sign of age - 7 years old, wear and tear"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"If any bro here can share the 3 year warranty promo code, please pm me.
I'll try enter into the vantage app.
Nice to have even though my experience so far with this brand of laptop positive."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Felt that the battery can do better, still observing it. But i really like the Better Battery mode. Quiet and Fast!
Finding some light games to play but couldnt find any."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"yeah same, please pm me too! the 3 years warranty will help to cover through my years of studies if any problems occur."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,i received all the accessories except for the mouse. is it weird that the laptop is still not shipped out yet?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"So does the 3 year warranty can apply together  with 15%?

Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,These fans seems good too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Laptop surprisingly arrived yesterday around 10PM.
Temperature looks quite good, even though the keyboard gets hot. I tried running Anthem on high settings for an hour. GPU temp 45C at idle stayed around 70C most of the time, and maxed out at 74C. Hard drive temp is barely affected within 5C difference from idle and it fluctuates. Not sure about CPU temp though, since the app doesn't detect the sensor for CPU, but I'll try it again later.
For those who wants to customise, but unsure if it is worth the $20 to upgrade to black keyboard with backlight, this is how the default grey keyboard no backlight looks."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"The black keyboard means no back lit right?
At first, i felt it wasnt worth it until i saw the actual keyboard. The blue contrast really pops out and without light felt bright too."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,you mean its too bright?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I think can dim the lights too
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,yup you can. 3 modes. Fn + Spacebar
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yup i mean i like the keyboard brightness. The medium brightness is superb good already.
I still dont bear to game with this laptop for a hour.
I think need to warm up alittle, yesterday was smelling some hot plastic."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"anyone know the difference between i7-9750h and the i5-9300h, apart from performance? would the i5 use less power and run at lower temperatures compared to i7?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Just ordered World War Z game to test out this laptop! Last time i use to game on my old ps4, which all the games are so costly!
This laptop is awesome
I played Apex legends on High, GTX 1650 is really nice!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,nice! but was it damn hot tho?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"All look good to me!
I'm thinking the one the requires the least energy to function likely better - less demands on the already heating up laptop.
What do you guys think?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I second that!
Totally like the blue backlit keyboard.
If anyone considering the regular one vs. the blue backlit.
Get the latter. It's awesome IMO!
Also helps if you working in dim light conditions."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I dont think its very hot. Reasonably warm temperature.
Noisy is one thing but not as whiny as my old asus rog too."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Even a laptop stand would definitely help the air circulation below better. Looks like the base of the laptop does not really have ample of space for the tilt .
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"So I received my laptop earlier in the afternoon yesterday after reattempt delivery, and I just got back home at this timing. Wanted to sleep straight but decided to do a short unboxing experience here.
When I first saw it, i immediately look at the seal which earlier on bro told me the seal wasn't placed properly. So this is how the delivery box and the seal part look like. Guess lenovo did something to it? Pasted white box for personal privacy reason


These are the parts that came in the box. Power brick and plug left, Laptop center, Setup guide right

how the bottom of the laptop looked like privacy reason for the white box again

Finishing of the top lid looks good. I like the smooth feeling.

Opening the lid will have this thin protective sleeve for the screen.

And, the final look.

As it is rather late now, i'll probably do my test when i wake up and give a short review of what i feel, maybe at night."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,thinking of buying total war:3 Kingdom. The graphics is solid but not sure if this laptop can handle
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Wah seh. The blue lighted keyboard looks chio.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Mine is transiting in shanghai, not sure where will it go now.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Hard to predict. Most of us, had travelled around the world before coming to Singapore.
Travelled more than my lifetime.
Anyway playing world war z on this laptop is zippy smooth on medium. High might be jittery.
It’s on sales on epic store, paid $20 only. At least can stretch this laptop haha"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,World War Z is online multi player game right... $20plus seems like a good deal.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Can be coop and offline too. That’s why I purchase it. Can secretly play during work. LOL
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Age catching up. Last time chiong CS no issue now if I play such game, will feel dizzy haha old man liao"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"True. Couldn’t tahan for a Long time.
Did you guys update the Drivers by yourself or it’s already updated when you unbox?
Because I noticed my hard disk has several Drivers file but look like it’s been updated before shipping. Hence why the seal was opened."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"how many fans are in it ah? like 2 with 1 on either side, 2 but both on 1 side, or just 1 fan?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Not daring enough to open the chassis to see how many fans.
Anyone want to more games, i just discover Division 2 also on offer. 30 sgd only sia. I just made my order. Tonight gona game!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,ok I bought this. will post review next week when I tested it out.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I ran some updates. But there weren't many.
Likely because this laptop is so recently manufactured.
Btw, my package came with seal intact
Mine says manufacture date at bottom is 19 May, 3 weeks ago.
First time own laptop that is so recently launched. Good! Fewer updates to do."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,I think ours are in the same shipment batch
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"What updates you ran ? Couldn’t find driver update but more of windows update only.
I think need to get a laptop stand soon."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Here's my personal review about the laptop after using it for about 45 minutes of gaming CS go, mid settings with high performance on battery mode. brightness max.
Timestamp: 11.30PM, battery at 99%

After gaming for about 47 minutes of CSGO
Timestamp: 12.17AM, battery at 18%

So here's what i feel right after ending my game:
- The keyboard, except for the number pad area feels really hot. I think this is common among laptops after gaming?
- As for the bottom side of the laptop where the intake vents is located, the left side is really DAMN hot compared to the right side. But after about 30minutes, it seems to have cooled down while i'm typing here. This is something that i'm worried about. I think i'm getting a laptop cooler even though I know I hardly gonna game on this laptop.
- I'm not used to having the power button on the keyboard, almost tried to press down the key while typing in game as i thought it was delete button. Think with more practice i can remember not to press down during work.
- Battery life at the highest performance drained about 81% while gaming for 47 minutes. So i guess you have to plug in your laptop while gaming... Not really impressed but i think it's quite common as well.
- The exhaust vents at the hinge there gets really warm. I'm not sure why they build it that way but I think it should be fine. You can hear the fan noise loud but not to the point where it disturbs you. Pretty common i guess. As i'm typing on the laptop now, there really isnt much sound coming from the vent.
- If you are the type that have sweaty fingers like me, you probably might want invest in keyboard cover. There are alot of fingerprint on the keyboard and i'm kinda ""sian"" since it's new. Can wipe it off with cloth / tissue so nothing to worry about.
I haven tried using it for normal work yet. But overall this laptop feels decent  for it's keyboard and touchpad. The only thing i'm worried about is the heat generated during gaming session, otherwise no complains for now. I'm glad that this has both integrated intel UHD 630 graphics and dedicated graphic card so you can save a little battery."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Thanks for the review! Yeah the battery life is indeed very bad. They should offer a higher capacity battery model and I would definitely upgrade it. Otherwise, this is a v good laptop for its price. Guess I have to wait till this Friday to receive mine! Just departed hefei china at 6.30pm tdy, anyone with the same tracking details?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,I think with higher battery capacity means it will be much heavier? i don't have a gaming laptop before but i'm just guessing if the lighter the laptop i think the battery span while gaming at high performance is gonna be less than an hour or two.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"yeah but i personally dont mind another 100-200g for double the battery capacity, imagine being able to use it for light tasks for a comfortable 9 hours before charging cos given how well it fared for the gaming test, i will be happy it last for 4 hours doing light tasks"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,I just played total war: romance of 3 Kingdom.. Superb feel. Graphics is good and no lag
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Hi, somehow i cant spin more than once, anyone can share 15% code? Or any other codes. Thanks!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Close your browser again and open lor
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Personally I felt the keyboard orientation is a little weird for me. Such as the shift key was too close to WASD layout. Hence playing any Fps game can make my finger alittle cramp.
Petshijie - Wah nice background! How you manage to customise the clock ah?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I don’t mind too. But most of the time I will plugging in.
Where is our 9hours of battery life. This Lenovo marketing team really jokers"

Unboxing this laptop is crazily shiok"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yeah i think my very old laptop long ago can last me 2+ hours on dota 2. Quite disappointing for the battery life of this laptop.
Anyway i saw there's a rapid charge option to chose. I read somewhere online saying if you use rapid charge too often it can affect the battery lifespan. Is that true? Currently i set it to off.
Hmm i think the shift key is okay. Just have to get used to it. I'm using wallpaper engine, downloaded from steam! But have to pay money to get the program. I put custom video for my background haha."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Rapid charge, use it only prior to bringing it out so that it will be 100% charged. If you switch off i think it becomes Conservative mode, you can leave the plug on as I think its meant to not overcharged the battery. Go to Lenovo Vantage, it will explain to you the difference between rapid and conservative mode."

I am guessing it will go to korea and then the usa before coming to sg based on the previous trips travelled by the other laptops on this forum"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,As desktop daily usage

I only did Lenovo and Windows update.
Didn't see a driver update. Guessing it come together under the hardware option."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Nice!

It's lovely if not bringing out. I went for the 15 cos I may travel with it."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Regarding the battery life, heat, and noise.
I've tried setting the battery performance to the lowest - slide to the extreme left.
It works great without compromising performance at least for me.
Battery life longer, laptop does not heat up, and totally quiet"

Didn't keep an eye on the battery. Guessing it is around 3-3.5 hrs.
Btw, I found the equalizer for music.
It is under Settings for the installed music player.
Can't comment on the battery life for working with docs, pdfs, xls, etc.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"ya, i retrieved it from the lenovo website. The tracking number sent to my e-mail was a wrong one. I think the other bro also same scenario. But the important thing is, the parcel has indeed arrived in SG!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Right! Lenovo website shows the correct tracking no. But it is not linkable/click able. The email one can be clicked, so if you never really notice, the tracking no. Is different. I already feedback to lenovo liao. What I afraid is our parcel got switched.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Here's my quick review:





Tried running a 4k uhd 60fps video. Was pretty impressed with the display too!
Generally, very sleek laptop. Well design with minimalist look. Lighting of keyboard is nice. Can dim as well. Weight is quite good to bring around. Currently tried playing some steam games like subnautical. Runs well. Heat dissipation is rather good. But the heat vend under then display is abit worrying for me. Never tried AAA games. Overall, for 1.2k laptop. This is really a very valuable buy.
Also hoot the legion mouse for $11 buck. Is very worth it if you are gaming. Worth the bucks!

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I like the display too, huge upgrade from my current laptop.
$1.2k laptop really bang for bucks and can play most of the games comfortably"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"i got mine at ard 7pm too, loving it!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Where do you find the settings for the different power modes? Can't find this ""bar"" you're talking about... TIA!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,When you press the little battery icon on the right of the screen. It will shows you the bar
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Looks great! mine's still stuck at korea
estimated delivery is on Saturday but do ups guys actually deliver on a weekend?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Noticed got 2 types of 512gb ssd
Which one should I be going for ?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"You can check the scheduled delivery date by UPS. It will be accurate, so unlikely it will arrive early or it will follow the Lenovo order status page."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Am contemplating downgrading my gaming rig to this since I have barely played any graphic intensive games in 2 years.
Is this one of the best valued laptop in the market now? Most probably Ill only end up playing FIFA.
Check out price is $1310 discounts included. Excluding shopback which has 7% cashback and credit card 2.5% bringing the total to around $1187"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yes you should go for it!
Worth every single cent.
As Long you don’t mind the poor battery life."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"laptop reached changi today morning from korea with arrival and import scans, but it just got updated with departure scan? going on a world tour again? gosh
anyways, the expected delivery date is still this saturday, hopefully can get it by then tho i am not surprised if it gets postponed to next monday"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Is the discounts you mention using the minus 15% off?
You can compare it to aftershock forge series actually, though I would still choose this lenovo laptop because of the minimalist look, freebies and massive discount compared to aftershock."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Gosh i certainly hope it will reach to you this weekend. I'm sure UPS won't screw up. Anticipate your new laptop
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I think once it reach CHANGI, means going to deliver to you soon. Cheers!

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yes inclusive of the 15%
Price is based on choosing the 1650, i7, 16gb ram, ips screen and 512ssd without any HDD
There are 2 512ssd choices, which is the right one to choose?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,If it departs at Changi Singapore. It is transferring to another ups branch isn’t it? Just like sending down to the nearest post office for sorting?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"i thought the battery not bad alr for a gaming laptop?
the other poster says 5hrs for playing video and 3-3.5hrs for playing legends dk what's that, maybe LoL"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Quite standard battery life lo. But not a dealbreaker for me.
Does anyone felt that when the laptop wakes up from lid close to open, kinda of slow?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yea. Battery really is pretty poor for this model. If I put to full performance mode. At 100%, battery life state an estimate of 1 hour only sia

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I removed my first Hdd so I have a choice of 2280nvme or 2242nvme TLC
One got tender loving care ah"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Otherwise if you usually dock at home, it’s really a seamless gaming laptop which can game and bring out for work. But I bring this laptop to my workplace to game... LOL"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"tbh i am not too sure which to go for too but SSDs that is the TLC type usually have lower endurance than the other types. Tho i am not sure which type is the one not labelled as TLC. So in this case I will go for the one without. This is ofc based on my google knowledge abt the diff nvme ssd types. Experts if any pls advise.
As for the 2280 vs 2242, its the dimensions of the drive. 22mm x 80mm or 22mm x 42mm. So the 2280 drive is the longer one. If its me, I will go for the 2280 one as for 1 the dimensions is more standard. 2 Its not labelled as TLC so hopefully iis built using the technology with btr endurance ratings."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Ordered the 2280 as recommended
Now the wait! Have never owned a laptop before. Have always been a gaming desktop person"

Lenovo Ideapad L340,i'm going to get this laptop? anyone know what's the 15% discount code?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Talk to the chat agents online, they might offer you something"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"i talked to the person, but he only gave me 10% lol"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I would suggest getting like those portable desk table to work on your sofa instead. But here's 2 that i found from shopee. I don't own any of the 2 but you can have a look. Just search ""desk table"" or ""laptop stand"" on shopee.
Try spin the wheel from lenovo main website. got the 15% discount from the spin the wheel popup. Try it with incognito browser. everytime you spin and if you didn't get the 15%, close the browser and open in incognito browser again."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I asked directly for 15.. they did give in the end
Do try"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Have pm-ed you the code
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"My laptop was delivered. Just played around with it for a few minutes and these are my first few impressions.
1 Build quality is better than i expected. Feels dense and of high quality. Screen is better than expected too, somehow look like its of a higher quality than other 1080p laptop panels I've seen haha!
2 It has an Intel AC 9560 wireless card. One of the best out there. Totally saturates my 500mbps connection on 5ghz. Impressive.
3 Lenovo Vantage is useful. The pass through power Conservation mode is quite unique to Lenovo laptops I guess. Battery will degrade less if you spend most of ur time plugged in.
4 Speakers are not bad sounding too. Can get quite loud tho maybe its because its quiet now at night.
5 Fast boot times. Did a restart and it came back up in no time.
6 Feels good to be able to open the laptop with one finger/hand. Laptop is sturdy and hefty enough and the hinge feels quite solid tho it wobbles abit when you push on it.
7 Date of manufacture is 9 days ago for me. Feels abit shuang if its impt to you haha
As for thermals and stuff, will test when I have time. This weekend is quite busy for me so probably no time to test haha! Feel free to ask if there are any questions!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"THIS.
I have a Lenovo Legion Y530 with that as well.
Originally designed battery capacity is 52,500 mWh, used for 6 months but the current battery capacity is 53,000 mWh >100% battery capacity"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Thanks. I talked to a live chatter called Moses and he die die told me 10% is max. Then I came back 30mins later and got assigned to Thomas gave me 15% immediately lol.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I came to know there are different department handling the chat. One lady I spoke to cannot give discount and apparently she is from some invoice department. Another lady is able to give 10% and when I questioned her, she said she is from quotation dept hence can give discount but the discount code will only last 10mins from the point she generates"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"How does the battery conservation mode works? Sorry newbie here. Do we plug in all the time? Or there is some function we should enable?
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Conversation mode works by powering the laptop directly using the power brick. The laptop will have to be plugged in all the time and instead of charging the battery and the laptop using power from the battery like what most laptops does, Conservation mode means that the battery will not be charged and instead, the laptop will power through the power brick, like a normal desktop, hence the battery will not be constantly charged and discharged."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"One thing i noticed is when the brightness level is dropped down to 0%, the laptop screen goes extremely dark and impossible to see.. is that normal? Cos for most laptops is doesnt go THAT dim lol"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Wow. That's a pretty handy function. Will check that out. The battery drains really too fast when gaming...
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Alrgiht. Yea. Manage to activate this. Thanks bros for sharing such wonderful feature.
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Yup! Very useful feature if you stay plugged in most of the time.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Played around with the laptop just now. Cooling system is not bad but not the best. Room temp is ur avg SG temp, no aircon. Idle at around 45-50 degrees and at 100% cpu usage its around 70-75 degrees with sustained clock speed of 2.9ghz. Note that this CPU max clock speed is rated at 4.5ghz. TDP is limited to 35w at 100% load instead of rated 45w.
Used XTU to undervolt the CPU and managed to achieve -0.160mv stable undervolt. System crashed at -0.180mv so -0.160 is pretty safe.
Cinebench R20 went from a score of 2100+ to 2500+ while CPU temps remains at 70-75 degrees. Clock speed at load is increased to 3.1ghz.
I think its the best this laptop can do le. All these is tested at max performance power profile with charger connected eith laptop at conservation mode. Could have pushed it further if it has a more robust cooling solution. Any pros in undervolting pls advice haha!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Cool! thank for testing the power of this laptop. Yea the cooling system is quite average. The vent at the bottom is what worries me alot and i don't really see it cooling down fast. I think i might invest in a laptop stand rather than laptop cooler cause i'm bringing this laptop out more often than putting in one place. Maybe find one in taobao haha.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"The undervolt value differs for different CPUs. Am able to reach -0.160mv for mine but many online can only reach a stable -0.050mv for their i7-9750H. Have to do trial and error.
Am looking for some foldable laptop stand to stick them to the underside of the laptop.. not sure if there are any! Will probably do a test to see if raising it above the surface helps at all first, cos for some laptops it does not have any difference at all tho, need to blow air in for it to have btr cooling."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,I think that this laptop need to have more space on bottom for better air suction while top vent needs blow off sideway leh... lol!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"some real world testing, was rendering a video in premiere pro, its relatively fast and even though its not thermal throttling, the cpu is limited to 2.6ghz at full load at 75 degrees. not looking great. thats like 1.9ghz away from max clock speed of the i7-9750H, alot of wasted potential in this laptop.
for people wanting to get the full potential out of this cpu, i would recommend spending a few hundred more to get one with a btr cooling solution"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,So this laptop have bad battery life and not so good cooling system?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"i choose the 2280 SSD. in the order detail, it is written TLC.
Second Storage Selection	512GB M.2 2280 NVMe TLC"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Can’t say it’s bad battery life when the battery cell capacity is small.
When we talk about cooling system, it is when the laptop at peak performance, it’s warm. But normal usage is very cool and quiet."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yeah, if only the battery capacity is like 90+wh :/ battery life is on par with other laptops of same specs having the same battery capacity.
Yeap, laptop is warm at 100% load. At full load the cooling system cannot keep up with the heat output as seen by the relatively low clock speeds. Wouldn't say its bad, its just insufficient and not effective. But at least they decrease the clock speeds to keep temps in check at abt 75 degrees, else the lifespan of the cpu will drop significantly.
Bottom line is at least from my POV, if you want the cheapest laptop at this specs, this is the laptop to go. If you need the most power and is a hardcore gamer/editor that wants the most performance, go for others like Aftershock Forge, Legion, Dell G series etc that have better cooling solutions. But be prepared to pay abt 1.5x to 2x the price for abt the same specs as the fully maxed out L340 Gaming"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yes, when I set the brightness level to the lowest, it is totally dark.
Don't see a light sensor on the L340 which in my opinion is very good.
My old Lenovo has a light sensor which adjusts the brightness automatically.
Didn't like that and pasted a sticker over the sensor so the brightness won't fluctuate"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Anybody realise that the charger is making quite abit of noise when using the laptop intensively?

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"When using shopback, need to key in any promo code? Or just checkout as per normal?
Only need to key in the 15% right?"

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Woah shiok man. Order it already. Shopback18 plus the 9% cashback. 1k for gaming laptop lol
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Didn’t realise also, will observe.
Wah now it’s 18%! This laptop gona be super value. Max all the specs and get maximum discount. Buy buy buy!!! Hahaha"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Whoa really? Its still 15% max for me as far as I can see haha!
Edit: Saw @Angelical093 comment, whoa the discount is even higher than the IT show"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Nope, no issues for me.
One thing i find it frustrating is that the 2 fingers tap on the trackpad doesnt activate the right click. Anyone facing this as well?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yeah, so strange to have it at such a low brightness. Really almost 0% sia hahaha!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"seems that with the 18% code applied, it is not tracked by shopback? I have order on saturday. but until now it is still not tracked by shopback."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"To enjoy shopback, you have to:
1. Click the link from shopback website
2. If you have use a desktop browser, you can choose to install the browser extension"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,i did click the link from shopback to go to Lenovo website to make my selection and  purchase
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Hmm does the cashback stack? Like 18% and the 9%? Best to read the fine prints since both codes are frm shopback.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"according to shopback's official policy, only promo codes featured on shopback can get cashback
in this case the promo code is actually from shopback so there shouldn't be any issue."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Wow! Nice!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Not true. Mine is tracked. 100 dollar lol
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yeah it is madness. I only pay 1k for the laptop now. 100 dollar cashback lol
1000 dollar for Nvidia Geforce. i7 processor. Like wow. Really good deal. Don't think i can get such laptop even in IT show. Hopefully nothing go wrong with the laptop."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,It is 18% discount plus 9% cashback. So actually is 27% discount
Lenovo Ideapad L340,This one need to change mouthpad setting
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I think initially it was like 15%, 7% cashback. Now is 18%,9% cash back"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Mine can't choose also
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Change from what to what? The other mousepad gestures still work.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Yeah i took the GTX1050 as well. Mine not customised though.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Your mousepad need to click few times b4 it respond?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,I think lenovo people must be thinking. Why so many orders for this laptop
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Nope. All the other gestures work except the 2 fingers right click gesture.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,The gtx1650 shiok.. game medium setting is a Breeze
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yeah. But i am more afraid later the laptop kaput fast. Overheating..
I laptop destroyer. Me not laptop flipper. Intend to last for 6 years at least.
I don't really play game. Need laptop for work purpose. Not sure if this is the right one. Have been searching for the right laptop for really long. Damn headache. I am more concerned about the ventilation, heating element and also the battery life."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"My i7-9750H have no problem running at full 4.5GHz.
Create a new Windows ""Gaming"" power plan using High Performance plan, set BOTH maximum processor and minimum processor states to ""100%"" when ""plugged in""."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yup, agree with you.
For me so far, my old Lenovo has worked well for 7 years until lately acting funny. So hope this L340 will work as long if not longer.
If bros here have experience with other brands and models that can last well for some time, pls share"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,4.5ghz constant at full load? Hows the temps like? If its still manageable I will try it later. If it doesnt then I might just give lenovo a call to see if there's anything I can do abt it.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Mine just arrived today.
Tested without a notebook cooler pad which I will be getting one.
Tested watching 4k and FullHD videos, no gaming yet.
HWMonitor shows:
At between 4.2 to 4.5GHz, CPU temperature between 50+ degrees, highest was 90+ degrees but jumped up to 90+ for only a few seconds.
GPU temp. GTX1650 hanging around 45 degrees."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Mine shipped out yesterday! Wooohoo. How long does shipping take for u guys?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Wah the shopback18 yesterday checked have, today the code doesnt seem to work..
Now the website only seems to have 15% plus 7% cashback available.. still very good pricing though"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yesterday last day for 18%. Now my laptop only cost me 1k exact. LOL. gaming laptop that cost only 1k haha.
18% and 9% cashback. Good deals man"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Just checked that I had my cashback rejected
Rather upset since its almost $90 grrrrr
See if the shopback CS is able to do anything."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"From what i saw from youtube review. They say the cooling system not that good. The heat will go up to the screen or something. So i dare not take the risks buy the 1650 GTX
Given the high quality of the laptop, i am hoping it will last 7 years."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Starting of course everything ok. You give yourself 2 years constantly running at clock speed of 4.5Ghz. The laptop surely will burn out if not enough ventilation
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Why is your cashback rejected when you use the app?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,No more sale???
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"1-2 weeks.
Follow the tracking. Pretty interesting. Most of ours went on world tour!"

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Ya man. Don’t even need to anticipate early delivery date.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Right click and select show icon only instead of search bar.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I see. Whats the cpu usage like? Streaming 4k video from YouTube or native playback?
In aircon room or outdoors room temperature? Wanted to test it on my own to see if my cpu can hit the same clocks at sustained loads. Else my cpu might be one with lower quality"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Thanks bro!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,no prob at all
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"btw, can anyone check if your touchpad gesture is working? particularly the 2 fingers tap to activate right click. mine's not working."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,would appreciate if anyone who is using the laptop now to help me check urs. tried installing new drivers but still cnt work
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Touchpad gesture
- 2 fingers tap to activate right click Not working for me
If I use 2 fingers press touchpad then can activate right click
- Scroll up and down page ok
- Zoom in and out ok
Sorry for the late reply.
I seldom use the L340. Old laptop still in good mood these days."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Very strange.  The fixed configuration ones come with 7200 RPM HD.   Can we later upgrade the HD ourselves by switching out the HD?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Two finger touch on the pad doesn’t activate the right click for me too.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Cooling system of this laptop. Not very good as expected. Those gaming laptops with this i7 and the gtx1050/1650 usually have 2 fans on both sides with 4 or more heat pipes and air intakes from the side and outlet at the back to distribute and dissipate heat efficiency.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Ah thank you to ypu and whatme! Seems like this issue is not just limited to me, meaning either bad drivers or smt else. Shall get in touch with lenovo regarding this matter."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,看來看去，我只留意到只有一個風扇打風。。。涼風怎麽進？

Lenovo Ideapad L340,哇。。。就算是在冷氣房，我看縫隙那麼窄。。。也吸不了多少涼氣吧。
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Dammit delivered today but I am not home
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I think 1650 emit more heat because the laptop ia forced to work harder? With the same cooling system as 1050, this would mean that the laptop won't handle the heat as efficient as compared to 1050.
Both laptop have same cooling system. Of course the lower graphic laptop would handle the heat more efficiently with the same cooling system on both laptop. So for those getting 1650, better to get another external cooling system.
I don't really need the better graphic. I using the laptop for work purposes and i don't foresee myself installing games to play"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Any feedback on whether the IPS display is decent enough? Is it too dim at 250 nits?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"nope, 250 nits is plenty bright. even sitting beside a window my brightness level is around 30-50% and 50% is the max at least for me. any higher will be uncomfortable for me cos i usually use the laptop for long periods of time. if not beside window my brightness lvl is around 10-20% only"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"internals of laptop if anyone's interested. lots of wastes space at one side of the laptop if you didnt choose the hdd option. even with the hdd option, there will still be abit of wasted space.
could've filled it with a 2nd ram slot or bigger battery"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I guess that space is for the 2nd ram slot.
Interestingly, via the Live chat, I was told that if I chose the ready-made model, I can upgrade ram later. My guess is should be using that space."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"nope. this model has a ram slot that is soldered on with 8gb ram leaving you with an empty slot which can be upgraded by users under that silver colored shield on the right of the ssd on the motherboard.
the empty space seems to be reserved for 2.5"" hdd thou"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,yeap! the 2 black horizontal strips to the left will be covered by the hdd once installed. there is still some empty space above that beside the fans. would've been perfect if its filled with another ram slot/battery/exhaust exhaust is totally possible without a redesign of the motherboard.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,if you look closely at the bottom of the image the hdd is there. there is still quite alot of space beside the fans 😭
Lenovo Ideapad L340,For those who receive the laptop. The UPS delivery man will confirm date with you?

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"So for the 1st deliveryattempt, they will not call you 1st before they arrived? Then how they know we at home?
For the mouse and the toploader, they did called and check with me to see if i am comfortable with the date and time though"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Their estimated arrival date is it zhun or not? Now is at Shanghai, China, arrival scan."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"intel XTU. and 0.160. still 35 watt.
0.160 and 0.150 is not stable, may cause sudden off when running prime95. i use 0.140.
*prime95 for load testing.
The CPU can't keep the turbo too long."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"They called but I was not home
They did a redelivery today but did not schedule anything. Luckily I was At home today.
Overall it still reached on schedule."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"yeah mines also at 35w. using throttlestop now for different power profiles when on battery/plugged in as well as auto undervolt upon startup. shall do a 1hr prime95 stress test later on with -0.150 and below later on. trying to find the sweet spot for best performance and stability as i am mostly doing video editing, having it shut down while editing halfway is the worst thing that could happen."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I thought b4 they deliver they will send sms to ask whether you will be home. That apply to me when they deliver my mouse and laptops bag.
So they don't do it for the lenovo laptop?
My laptop is in transit already. Not sure whether they would sms me to inform me in advance that they are coming"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,ahem...with proper good notebook cooler or withOUT ?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"laptop on top of desk. WITHOUT notebook cooler.
i will update the prime95 test using laptop fan tomorrow."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Any got a value ecoupon code? I lost my coupon spin because of copy overwrite. Wanted to hoot the 17 inch. Super value
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Try COUPO, share by someone else few page back"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"-0.100 undervolt
TDP increased from 35W to 55W
WITHOUT laptop cooler.
**lift up the laptop 30cm from the desk.
very minimum thermal throttle, stable at 4Ghz. At the end, i try resting the laptop at desk, throttling is more often."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"whats your temps at 55w TDP? in aircon room? why the -0.1 undervolt instead of -0.14?
asking as i want to know more info so i can better customise my power profiles."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"for me i intend to use the laptop for the next 5 years minimum until i graduate. was rendering out a video last night and max temp was 95 degrees even with -0.141 undervolt. decided to custom a profile so when temps reaches 85 degrees, it will drop to 3.2ghz and increase again when temps drop. basically very aggressive downclocking to keep temps in check. limited the tdp to 40w only.
maybe i should set a profile to go all out performance like yours only to be used in aircon room."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"aircon room 25' C. I never tried intel XTU before yesterday.
-0.140 undervolt. TDP 55 W.
WITHOUT laptop cooler. laptop is on the desk surface all the time without lifting up
tried 3x cinebench r20


I set the profile in intel XTU.
AC plug
-0.140 undervolt
TDP 55 watt
Cinebench R20 score 2700
Battery
-0.140 undervolt
TDP 35 watt
Cinebench R20 score 2350
Default
0 undervolt
TDP 35 watt
Cinebench R20 score 2150"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Thanks for the detailed results. Definitely better performance with raised tdp. Seems like lenovo set the default tdp at 35w to keep temps in check.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I'm interested in trying this out - undervolt to bring down temperature, on old laptop.
Software to download is Cinebench?
What do i need to know to tweak to bring down temperature?
Total newbie to this. Any advice appreciated"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,software used is Intel XTU or Throttlestop. See which you prefer. I am using throttlestop while @spot8ptr uses IntelXTU
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"So after much testing, I've come up with 4 profiles on throttlestop to suit my own needs. Decided to be nice to my cpu and not push it to 55w TDP with stable 4ghz like what spot8ptr did and partly because i cant seem to increase TDP on throttlestop lol. All temps tested at room temp of 33 degrees, so warm...
Profile 1 - Max performance
-0.141 undervolt
Avg TDP at max load: 44w
Avg temps at max load: 90 degrees
Max speed: 3.7ghz
Cinebench R20: 2519
Cinebench R20 with temps limits: 2437
for this profile I've set it such that it automatically switches to profile 2 once it reaches 82 degrees in an effort to prevent the cpu from reaching super high temps
Profile 2 - Safe performance
-0.141 undervolt
Avg TDP at max load: 33w
Avg temps at max load: 78 degrees
Max speed: 3.0ghz
Cinebench R20: 2312
Profile 3 - Power saver
-0.141 undervolt
Avg TDP at max load: 17w
Avg temps at max load: 60 degrees
Max speed: 2.2ghz
Cinebench R20: 1395
Profile 4 - Max battery.
-0.135 undervolt
Avg TDP at max load: 8w
Avg temps at max load: 51 degrees
Max speed: 1.1ghz
Cinebench R20: 659
Will be spending most of my time in profile 2, only switching to 1 when really needed. when out and about without charger and only using laptop for words/light browsing, will use profile 4. if need to do light work then will switch to 3. My profile 3 is also programmed such that when playing games and GPU reaches 65 degrees, the laptop will jump from profile 2 to 3 such that cpu is downclocked to keep gpu cooled.
This will allow me to get the ""profiles"" thing lenovo is advertising lol as when i am in profile 3 and 4, at max load the fan isnt even turning cos the cpu doesnt output that much heat. totally quiet tho performance is bad.
Edit: Will update with cinebench scores for different profiles. updated
Edit edit: added hotkeys so can switch between profiles conveniently."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Any decent laptop coolers for recommendation?
Thank you!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Can anyone advise on whether it is possible to switch out the HD for my own better HD or even an SSD? I made the mistake of configuring my system to have a 256 GB SSD and a 1 TB 5400 RPM HD because I didn't know I could opt for a 512 GB SSD but only if I don't select any HD.  The option for a 512 GB SSD doesn't unlock unless the HD option is deselected, which is quite confusing for the customer."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Coolermaster Notepal X3 has been cooling my Dell Vostro 3750 Notebook since 2013 which this notebook was purchased 2nd hand back then.
Both cooler and notebook still working perfectly, no ports, no parts, or anything not working.
Notepal X3 has been over the years awarded and proven and still in production and a current model, imagine just that!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,the 256 ssd and 1tb config is good too. you can install your games/apps on the hdd if the ssd runs out of space
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Yes but I'm concerned that the 5400 RPM HD will be super slow
Lenovo Ideapad L340,its not super slow actually. managed to transfer my files from my usb 3.0 external harddisk to the HDD at 90 - 100 MBps. can check the speed using crystaldiskmark.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Oh crap. Mine is also 256GB SSD+7200 rpm HD. Is it sufficient
Lenovo Ideapad L340,How do you set the hot key?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Guys, those who had received your laptop: where did your laptop go? Mine went from Hefei to Shanghai to Korea to Shenzhen and had arrived to Changi today. However the scheduled / estimated time delivery is 28 June. Is it going to travel somemore? Or will it sit at the hub to be delivered on 28th?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Lol same. Went to korea haha
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"For those who do DIY, u only get 5400rpm 1TB and 256GB SSD.
For those who choose the made ready one, u will get 7200rpm 1TB and 256GB SSD"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,are you using throttlestop too? can enable hotkey function to switch profiles at the bottom of the options panel.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Storage should be sufficient, if not can change out to a larger capacity HDD. Speed wise should be good too, can use crystaldiskmark if you want to know the exact speed."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"As Long the UPS scheduled delivery date is set, don’t worry about going anywhere. It will fulfil that day."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Actually i create a thread. Alot are encouraging moi to change to ssd. If i want to change, i also will change to larger ssd. Hdd kaput very fast siol.
I realised 512GB SSD is cheaper than 256GB+1TB HDD 7200rpm sia with other configuration constant. I wonder why.
I tried to configure through the DIY, 512GB SSD costs about 1309. Normal 256GB+1TB HDD cost 1349.
Thought SSD supposed to be more expensive?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"until now nobody still can figure out or advise on the ""Quick"" and Quiet"" mode supposingly to come with this laptop"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"btw I was using my laptop earlier and I was monitoring the battery by looking at the details on Vantage. It stated battery condition was good 2 hrs ago because it was around 25% left so I plugged the plug into it to charge and changed it to Rapid so that it will be charged till 100%. After charging to 96%, I realised that it got stuck at 96% for a while so I checked on the status again and I was shocked that it is now showing the battery condition as Poor. I am a very light user of the laptop and I did not even game alot or I would say the laptop is like sitting at the corner most time of the day.
And now when I unplugged the power, the laptop will be shut down. I cannot power up the laptop even when the battery is showing as 96%
Moreover I always turned on the cooler when I use the laptop fearing that it will overheat yeah I know I am paranoid.
Any idea whats the issue?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"SSD good cos its fast, reliable, consume less power, quiet but one thing is that it costs more per GB than HDD.
The HDD config costs more cos it have way more storage than the SSD config. A 1TB SSD is gonna cost more than the SSD and HDD config. I prefer having a SSD + HDD config as I can have windows and my apps installed on the SSD to enjoy fast bootup and app opening times and then store all my media files eg videos, movies, photos, games etc on the HDD. Its the most economical way as you dont need a super fast storage device to just store videos and all those.
Unless of course you dont store much media files or cash is not an issue. I edit videos frequently and one project can be as small as 50gb to as much as 300gb++. Every event covered the photos average out to abt 20gb. An all SSD laptop will be v expensive."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,yeah dk wheres the thing lenovo is advertising.. i guess my profiles are as good as it gets. my profile 3 and 4 is totally quiet under full load while 1 and 2 is my quick mode hehe
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Hm from what you've described it seem like you battery is gone case alr, cannot hold charge :/ Best to give lenovo an email and claim ur warranty. Even if you can fix it urself or suddenly become fixed on its own i feel its still best to tell them abt it and see what they can do. Such issue shouldn't show when the laptop is so new."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,What I don't understand is why in the DIY option I couldn't opt for the 7200 RPM HD? I could only go for the 5400 RPM HD options.  So strange
Lenovo Ideapad L340,yea thats something i dont understand too lol.. maybe they just wanna save costs bah. Really a strange move from them
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Woah how come new laptop so many issue. Better check sia
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Ya better check your laptop every single details lo.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yes. Mine also got issues. Adaptor is noisy...
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"My profile 3 is able to get 1.5hrs of usage at 33% left when doing just normal browsing. When just using words can last 2 hours. Profile 4 will be even more power saving.
If any of you are interested can do that too"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,I am going to bring it down to the service centre tomorrow. I called Lenovo and I can request for a 1-2-1 exchange. They said they will advise for a repair but I dont think I want that route. Its too new to have such prob.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,the laptop still cant power on without the power plugged in? good that you can request for a 1 to 1 exchange
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Yeah cannot power up  without the power plugged in.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Wonder where the laptop goes... Isit to the US? Or idling at the UPS Hub in SG but never update?
Why do they keep strictly to the scheduled delivery date 28 June when it was never set by anyone? Even Lenovo OVP state expected delivery date is 26 June."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I wish to do it like yours but i'm a complete newbie at such things. Scare do wrongly then screw up my laptop
Anyway I only switch on my laptop 3 times since purchased. need to use it and test now. Surprised to see this thread up till now"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"From our previous order tracking, it will show as in transit even in Singapore because they are transiting to the nearest delivery post office something like that.
Ignore the LENOVO OVP web. buay zhun lah. Just follow the UPS scheduled date.
After knowing that the battery can get defective, kinda afraid of over charging it too."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Actually we should stress test the laptop to its max now that it is brand new to make sure that nothing goes wrong. If it rly does show some problems then at least can exchange 1 to 1.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Mine same as your but showing 28 expected delivery arrival. So now not sure if it will come tomorrow or Saturday.
If UPS show expected delivery date 28 mean zhun zhun 28?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,So far it has been accurate or earlier for all 3 of my packages.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yup agree. What needs to be done to stress out the laptop?
Mine rarely used. Use for entertainment now and then only.
@tjrsasea: Thanks for software rec!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Let it run video / games on 24 hours.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"These laptop vacuum coolers can even bring down CPU temps from 100degrees to 60 and below.
More powerful model:"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,But we cant use this on the L340 Gaming. Exhaust vent is at the back covered by the screen
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Wow is the cooling really that bad? Mine arriving by tomorrow and I'm worried.  Maybe should have paid more for the Legion model haha
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Its worse than most gaming laptops. For the legion y540 you are looking at paying alot more for the same specs as the L340 Gaming. More than +$500
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Raised the laptop higher and buy a desk fan and blow at the vent lo.
That’s all we can do liao"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Ya, I understand, my L340 Gaming 17.3"" same... so the Notepal X3 will do the job just fine as well..."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"All the same... with a i7-9750H Processor that can turbo up to 4.5GHz same thing for gaming GPU, any higher priced gaming laptop will face the same heat issues, or thermal throttling...
The i7-9750H mobile processor performs better than the desktop i7-7700k, but just below the i7-8700k.
As whatme says, ""raise the laptop"" above the tabletop surface, higher the better, with a laptop cooler like the Notepal X3.
Top 3 laptop coolers like the Cooler Master SF-17 does just that  with a powerful fan multiple height adjustments, but more expensive than the Notepal X3."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"just sent my laptop to the service centre. They will escalate to see if I can do a 1 4 1 change. Usually its to replace the battery only. Whey they say repair, does not mean repairing battery cause battery cannot be repaired. It will be replaced with a new battery. Seriously its gonna take at least 3 weeks sigh!!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Hi all
There is some issue with delivery
I havent received the laptop, but apparently it has been showed aa delivered. Who should i contact?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Check your lenevo website for the tracking status. The tracker no. Provided to u via email might be wrong. It was the case for me.
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yeah. The tracking no. Is wrong. Want to ask. How to see correct one?
Yeah i saw it. Phew. Nabei. Fking lenovo."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,is there any application for me to stress test my laptop? I just received it
Lenovo Ideapad L340,no problem!
Lenovo Ideapad L340,wah thats long.. did they offer you any loner laptops to use in the time being? guess they have to ship the battery from China to replace in SG..
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"great! enjoy ur laptop
can just use any benchmarking tools or play some games. cinebench R15, Cinebench R20, 3dmark, prime95, aida64, unigine etc all works okay.
Crystakdiskmark to test the storage speeds if you are interested.
You can also do a few battery charging and discharging tests. try the rapid charge function etc too"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,I just received mine as well.   Working well so far.  Sorry if I sound like a real noob but if I want to change the HDD to an SSD of my own I can do so right?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"yup, as long as the OS is not installed on the HDD you can do so easily. Just make sure you get the SSD of the same physical dimensions of the HDD."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I may sound dumb, but how to ensure OS is not installed in the HDD?
can share the stress tests to be done on the laptop?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Go to This PC and look at the 2 disks available if you have the SSD + HDD available. They will say how many gb free on the drive. The one with data alr on it is the one installed with the OS.
But in this case if you have a SSD and HDD config, the OS is installed in the SSD. Feel free to swap out the HDD for a SSD if you need."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Can stress test ur laptop using the apps above. Usually new laptops should have no problem de but if you want to be extra safe you got a good working laptop, can test it using say prime95 for an hour to see if ur laptop is stable."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Do you guys have a little back light bleeding in the corners of the screen? I can see a little
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Becazue they said since I want to ask for a 1 to 1 change, they will need to escalate to the management which takes 2 weeks"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Yeah mine's at the top left. Are you planning to contact lenovo abt this?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Very dl with lenevo. Show them the clip of my noisy adapter, fizzing sound is so obvious, they can tell me they don't see any issue with it.. Really..?
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Is like that de, not just lenovo, many other brands also the same. Must see which customer service officer you are dealing with. Best is to just go down and show them, power adapter is not cheap too :/"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I think they will probably say that a little backlight bleeding is normal for an IPS panel.   Unless the bleeding is extremely bad, they probably won't do anything about it."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,is yours very bad? mine can be seen when the whole screen is black
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yes mine can be seen as well.  Maybe I'll just ask Lenovo about it.  Apart from that, I think the laptop is fine.  Can play MK 11 with high settings at 60 fps.  So not too shabby."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Alright, let me know whats the outcome. If can replace or repair idm too"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I am looking for a Lenovo Thinkpad
I mainly surf internet, microsoft office and some simple gaming maplestory and fifa online 3
Any recommendations ? Thanks"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,What game u play then got the fizzling sound?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,But power adapter more serious than backlight bleed.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,The battery life is really crappy
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"You mean the blue light from the keyboard?
I've maxed the blue light, then dimmed the screen until black - don't see any blue in corners of the screen."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Mine also don't have. Backlight bleeding for serious one, the black screen will seem 'cloudy' like got white patch"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,I'm also starting to notice a fizzing sound when my power is plugged in.   But quite faint.  I don't hear it when running on battery.   Is this a common thing?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Seemed like the fizzing sound is related to the intensity usage of laptop. I will hear it more when gaming on AAA games. But if I play L4d2 or other not so graphic intensive games, no fizzing sound. Also no sound while working on desktop or watching videos
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Hayate, do you think it's worth buying factoring its battery life and quirks?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"It depends on how you gonna use it. In terms of battery life. It is really below average. You get around 40-50mins play time on battery. If you were to frequently bring the laptop out, I guess it defeat the purpose. For me, its a desktop replacer, so I'll always plug it in.
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Definitely worth it for me even battery life is poor. Because it’s common issues for high performance gaming laptop to not have good battery life. You want good battery life, go for those Asus vivo book lo. 14 hours also can.
When it’s on battery mode, the laptop handle so well when watching video, smooth and cool."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"This one cost much less than my old Lenovo laptop, considering the specs.
Performance wise, so far ok. Wasn't expecting a true-blue gaming device like Legion.
Got a gaming laptop for the main purpose of being able to launch multiple types of files quickly and reduce chance of lag and hang. I don't game much, so this one is ok for my entertainment needs."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,so they refused to give me a 1-2-1 citing that the policy is such that 1-2-1 is valid for the 1st 7 days
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I'm also ask to go down to service center, refuse to let me exchange adaptor one to one which I check other countries they immediately send over new adaptersl after reporting of issue.
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I am asking them to re-review their escalation as I told them its too new to have such problem and its making consumer lose confidence with their product.
The CSO who spoke to me said I could ask for 1-2-1 if I dont want repair thus there seens to some differing opinions"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"So far up to now, by using the best battery mode. I only see two hours of usage.  Never see anything more than that though. How about you guys?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"How did u get 1390 for yr specs ?

Also the shopback works? I never use shop back before"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"SPINSAVE15P

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"2 hours of usage from 100% to 0% on best battery? What is ur usage patterns like?
For me can last 3 hours plus, sometimes 4 plus when doing normal browsing and typing and some videos. I am on my power profile 3 which I customised in throttlestop tho.. its a few pages of posts back."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Sales rep...
She gave me more than $300 discount, around 308 or so..."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Thanks for all the reply.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Can I buy the laptop via shop back? But my problem now is the 15 discount is given by lenovo and  not via shopback deal.
Like this can claim shop back bo?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Still can go thru shopback. Its simply just redirect you to lenovo website. The discount they gave you will be sent via a quotation into your profile which after shopback redirects you, you have to login anyway and checkout from there. Even if the discount is given to you via ecode, you can only add the ecode at checkout."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,1000kkkjjjjjj

Lenovo Ideapad L340,Could someone recommend a laptop cooler I can use with this laptop?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,I used this to raise my laptop higher for gaming. Since the vent at bottom is going in
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"No. I asked. End up self customised. Bought and realised shopback did not capture due to ad blocker.
Now cancelling.... zzzx"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Nice rec. Used to use similar ones. Good for working at table.
An elevated plastic stand with fans rotating works too.
The latter also works if you are not working at a table.
A bro had recommended a cooling stand some pages ago, complete with Qoo10 link.
Here's the link again"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Guys, I have ordered a customized L340 Gaming a few days ago.
I've selected the 4GB soldered RAM ...
Will there be an extra empty RAM slot if I choose the 4GB soldered RAM option?
I want to upgrade it myself."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Guys
First off. Once you are satisfied with existing laptop, you won't bother to keep reading to keep up with what's new.
That is me.
Now i am in need to change a new laptop and yes after some comparison between models from various brands out there. Here i am.
Decided on this, lenovo L340 with a budget of not more than $1500
noob question. Did you guys get your set online via Lenovo website or you guys think those retailers out there will beat website prices?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"This laptop is very new and up till now, none of the retailers are selling this yet. I guess if you want to customise your own configuration, go with the online configurator, which lets you max out everything. The pre configured models doesnt have an option for 16GB ram, for example.
Their online site is pretty good. Most of us here got 15% discount from lenovo reps and another 9% from shopback. That's 24% off listed price unless they count the 9% off from the price with the 15% discount applied, then it will be a little lesser than 24%. Plus all the $0.10 to $1 accessories. I got the Lenovo Gaming backpack, the normal Lenovo bag, toploader bag, mouse and mouse pad for just $2.30 more iirc. I would say all these is pretty hard to beat."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Hey bro, thanks.
Do advise on the 9% cashback.hows does it work, apply to the online site? And how to get the 15% from lenovo reps."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Depends on model you may try
GSS
SPINSAVE15P"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,thank you
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Same here. My IT stuff are used until obsolete or dead
So when I get new ones, I prefer to get the very latest models.
Got mine via Lenovo website, same as most bros here.
Also got the same discounts and similar add-ons as tjrsasea.
1 thing to note about this laptop is the short battery time, as experienced by many here. Battery time depends on what you run - games vs. surfing the net vs. videos vs. programming vs others. Also whether it is numerous applications vs. few applications. So really depends what you intend to use the laptop for."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Hi all! it's been long since i replied on this thread and it's still alive at this point.
Anyway i been using on and off within the past 2 weeks. I bought a laptop bracket for better airflow I think it has helped to allow more airflow to the computer at the bottom and a keyboard protector so that i won't have my sweaty marks on the keyboard.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Anyway, super reccomend u use ssd for this laptop. The boot up time is super fast, I think less than 10 secs. Its even faster than my old laptop boot up from sleep/hibernating mode.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Dear All,
need advise from those who own this laptop.
is it good to use?
or any other laptop to recommend?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"So far so good. Only negative point is battery life. The value of this laptop is not competitable by other brands, event clearance goods I reckon.
Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Here you go! I got the transparent version. Sadly they don't have TPU transparent so no choice have to go with silicon.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"i see.
if for normal school use, the battery life can last up to 4 to 5 hrs ?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,So far i been using for normal work. I think about 2.5 to 3 hours on average with the battery performance set to the best battery life.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"i see.
i still thinking should i get this laptop.  is it worth buying?
or any other brands or model to recommend?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Generally speaking, this laptop is really worth the price for it's specs and massive discounts/cashback you can obtain from lenovo itself and shopback. I doubt there are any laptops out there with the same specs that can beat this price point atm.
However, this laptop has a battery issue which drains rather quickly even when doing normal work. Most likely due to it's graphic card component. And sadly it weighs about 2kg but doesn't matter to me.
My suggest is that, if you do graphic work / gaming mid specs often and wish to buy a laptop that is decently specs, this would be the best purchase cost between 1k to 1.4k depend on your customisation. For me, i can close one eye on the battery life and the weight as that isn't my concern. You can also look at how many people eyeing on this laptop and purchased it in the end. I leave it to you to decide"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,I agree.   The cooling isn't very good also but that's probably par for the course when it comes to gaming laptops.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Cooler Master SF-17 180mm Fan Gaming Notebook Cooler fan speed rated at 700 - 1200 RPM ± 15%, bought at $74.39 during Lazada Mid-Year sale, after $10 Lazada voucher.
Cooling my Lenovo IdeaPad L340 Gaming 17.3"" - i7-9750H at 4.5GHz, GTX1650 4GB rather well. Fan turned up MAX.
38°C idle, gaming constant 58°C to 62°C, while gaming at 98°C for a few seconds at short intervals.

Don't blame on notebook cooler pads waste of $$$ if you are buying cheap ones, with lousy fans and cheap plastic material.

do i need to change/upgrade on my warranty to onsite and add in Accidental Damage Protection?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Nice to see that you're eyeing on this. Between the 3 option, i only see changes in the hard drive and RAM.
If you hardly run high demand programs adobe premiere, multiple programming application, etc, just an 8GB RAM would be fine. 16GB will help only if you are running a few demanding programs at once. But if you can afford it, then go ahead. Nothing wrong with splurging more on RAM.
As for the hard drive, if this is your main computer i.e you don't have a desktop or other computer or you like to store photos, videos, install programs, then suggest you to get the 1tb +256gb SSD. The 512GB SSD only option is better if you're not gonna put in many programs / storage items. You'll run out of data fast. But with that said, you can always buy a external hard disk. It's your decision to chose.
Warranty onsite or accidental damage protection is up to you, but the price point isn't really worth it in my opinion you're buying like 1k+ laptop then spend on insurance, abit bo hua ""not worth"" la unless you're getting those 2.5k++ gaming laptop"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"thanks for your reply.
i been thinking for weeks, and dont know which laptop to get. i am noob in IT specs.
i thinking to get a laptop that can last me for 2 years for school use.
i dont want to spend so much for a laptop as i have to pay for my school fees.
i seldom game, just normal school use, download songs.
after reading reviews etc, i think for a price of 1,200 to get a i7 gen 9, i think is consider a good deal. but dont know if the laptop is working well or not. am afraid halfway haywire, and carry in warranty not covered.
if i choose the price of 1,232, good enough?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Imo, the price-point of this laptop is good for the specs.
If you are doing basic stuff like surfing and working on documents, there are even cheaper Ideapad models out there compared to this gaming one.
Really depends what you want to do with the laptop, then consider the specs."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Intel -H is very demanding and sucks battery very fast...
And considering battery is 3-cell type.... very small battery capacity...
means you will be charging the laptop very frequently ... almost Like plug in to power supply all the time. If on battery .... maybe wont even last you 1.5 hour."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I see. If you aren't gaming much means not touching on graphic intense game, Dota and csgo still ok, then you should consider other laptops which are meant for school. I believe there's lighter option and comes with i7 as well. I'm not a notebook expert but I think this laptop like not worth to you"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"For your use case, i would suggest you get the i5 version instead. graphics card can stick to the 1050 3gb. 8gb ram will do too. storage can get 128ssd plus 1tb hdd."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"A powerhouse is not for you for this new Lenovo IdeaPad L340 series, with a 3-cell battery, it's more like a desktop. Battery too small capacity.
I have used Acer Swift 3 for more than a year for work - lightweight, good battery life on the move, up to 12hrs. Screen is IPS, good display quality. Storage mostly SSD.
Get it from the Acer Official Store on Lazada or go to shop and bargain. Lowest I seen was $800++ on sale.
Silver color model:
Blue color model:
Same model but with MX150:
Just do a search in Acer Official Store on Lazada for the Swift 3, many models to choose."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I'm not good at customising lappy but I am looking at this model as in i recommend
Ideapad L340 15
81LK002KSB
Black
Any advise? Or ownself customise is better?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Depends on
1. what you want to use the laptop for
2. your expectations
Many have feedback on the poor battery life for this laptop.
Also the design of the air vent near the screen.
Personally, I really like the blue backlight, and it can cope with what i want to use the laptop for.
If you are looking for something that is value for money.
I think this one fits the bill. Although there could be other value for money laptops out there."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Wheres the best place to buy lenovo laptop cheap outside of those IT show period?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"can buy online via Lenovo website, check out with SPINSAVE15P will do."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Customized is better , at least you can get 16gb of ram
My example here, make sure you check out with discount code to enjoy 15% off for during this period"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Thanks! Do you know when this code ends?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Maybe end of this month or after Nationalday, I was Guess this end soon"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Try out COUPO instead. May yield better discount than SPINSAVE15P.
Savings I see is about double."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Nice shares, but still considering to buy from Malaysia 🤣🤣"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Finally there is an answer to the Quick and Quiet mode.
For quick or quiet mode, please press Fn+Q to toggle. Please try and let me know if this will work for you. Arjay_Lenovo"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Thanks for sharing, bro!
It works for me. But I wonder where I can see the mode selection other than the quick flash of the icon on the screen. Also haven't figured out the difference between the 2 modes.
Any buddy here can advise? Thanks!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,must capital Q? Cant get it to work tho.. how do you even see the switch in the first place
Lenovo Ideapad L340,I saw somewhere from the comments that you need to Download 2 Lenovo app vantage + another one then you are able see an indicator about the switch explicitly. I have no time to explore yet. Go read the comments from the fb link I gave
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Can play overwatch in high settings ?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,yup i tried everything that they state there already but still cant see anything about the switch. able to take a pic to show what you see when you switch profiles?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Boot into Bios, you can select there.
Something like this"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Hello Everyone,
At the beginning I would like to say Welcome to everyone at the forum, as I have just joined
So, coming back to main topic.
I have recently bought L340, the 17 version, with spec including:
- i5 9300H
- GTX 1650
- 8 GB RAM
- custom 480GB SSD added by reseller
After reading entire topic, I've also bought notebook cooling pad, Cooler Master Notepal U3 Plus - that is great as it allows You to place fans right in a place when air vents are in our case at the very back of the notebook.
Currently I am monitoring temps with RealTemp when notebook stands on the cooling pad, but additional fans are turned off. So far, I have experienced maximum of 85C, after long gaming session like 10 hours or so, and the top of the case including keyboard was warm, but never hot.
So even without additional vents, placing notebook on a stand where he can get more air, helps a lot.
Soon I am going to enable additional fans to compare temps in similar gaming session.
Haven't done any undervolting or changes yet. Default settings, clean Windows installation + Lenovo softs/drivers.
In conclusion, I am quite glad from the overall especially considering the price/performance ratio, at least for now. There is just one thing that annoys me a lot, and I should warn You about it.
Notebook has an ""Always On USB"" ports option. It keeps USB ports powered up all the time also when turned off completely as long as charger is plugged in.
I contacted Lenovo about it, and unfortunately this
CANNOT BE TURNED OFF.
Why is is troublesome? Well If You have notebook cooling pad that is USB powered like the one that I mentioned above it is never turned off, unless You unplug it out of USB port after every notebook shutdown or unplug the charger after every shutdown doesn't make any sense for 17' desktop replacement. Any additional USB devices like usb light etc, will also be powered on like 100% of time.
So far, I haven't find any solution/workaround for that. I am considering using external USB charger to power cooling pad, extended with some smart plug that would be turned on/off via some script at Windows startup/shutdown .
Regards,
Patryk"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Update your Lenovo Vantage app through the microsoft store. I think there is an option there to turn off always on power for the USB ports.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Already did that. There is no option for my model. Also Lenovo support:
Lenovo Ideapad L340,isn't ur model the same as ours? will take a screenshot for you to see later
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Oh, I hope it is.
Details:
IdeaPad L340-17IRH Gaming
Serial Number: PF1RFY62
Product Number: 81LL
Bios: BGCN21WW
I went through entire Lenovo Vantage and didn't find the option,  so screen would be perfect.
I can also see Lenovo Vantage Beta in Microsoft Store.  Maybe thats the way to go."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Thanks! I'll give it a try.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"When you press Fn+Q I use lowercase q, you will see in white in the middle bottom of screen

Sent from From Power of LOVE using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Here it is - the 2 icons you will see when you press Fn Q
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"The reason they gave me was the cashback was not approved by the merchant. Shopback/lenovo is a fking joke. I used the correct promo code and the click activity was tracked. No reason why lenovo did not approve the cashback. shopback told me there's nothing they can do, only can reimburse me $15 dollars out of their own pocket lol... They shortchanged the customer when the problem is between the two companies."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"That's strange. I just checked mine, $98 confirmation. Why not try emailing lenovo to see which department handles with shopback then escalate it from there?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,wah~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Just received my laptop today and realized my 256GB SSD is missing, as when I selected 2TB 5400rpm hard drive, the 2nd hard drive will be hidden and I didn't notice it. My bad for not checking carefully.
Anyone know if I can additional M.2 SSD myself?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Sure not an issue for self adding ssd
Lenovo Ideapad L340,thanks. Just ordered a M.2 SSD
Lenovo Ideapad L340,should have ordered the 2tb hdd and get a ssd myself when i bought mine too.. 1tb not enough space for constant video editing. and 256 gb ssd also not enough for media files.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"What's the name of the cable that connects the adapter rectangle heavy box to the laptop? Not referring to the end that connects the adapter to the power outlet.
Asking cos that part of the cable for my old Lenovo laptop is loose and can only charge the battery when angled and held. So I want to get a replacement.
Thanks!"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,For Windows just download the ISO from Microsoft. Use media creation tool. The license is embedded in your BIOS so no need to key in any product key. For office check with microsoft.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Thanks, will try that out. Waiting for my SSD to be delivered."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Any bros here kena laptop reboot due to driver power state failure? Dam disappointing.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I also kena no shopback cos lenovo informed shopback that they did not capture my order via shopback link.
I sweared it did it correctly. End up shopback give me 25 bucks"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I saw from the site
,  for L340-15IRH these are the Storage device:
- 2.5-inch storage drive
- M.2 solid-state drive
- Intel® Optane memory
My laptop come with the 2TB 5400rpm harddisk, and I just bought a M.2 solid-state drive. Since I am going to open the laptop to install the SSD, can I also install the optane memory?
My question is:
1 Can I install optane memory I will have 2TB 5400rpm harddisk, m.2 SSD and optane memory?
2 If yes, will it be useful?
I am very new to optane memory, please advise. TIA."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Same lor
. I even have the shopback google chrome extension, those low amount cashback no problem, big amount suddenly got problem. I wouldn't be so angry about it if it were my own fault also"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Off topic but seems like Lenovo doesnt offer SSD plus HDD with the customise option anymore? Instead only offer optane memory?
For your first qn, dont think you can have all 3. From the pics of the laptop there is only 1 HDD drive bay and 1 M.2 slot on the motherboard. So you gotta choose between the optane and the SSD. For me, I will go for SSD instead of optane as the optane memory doesnt count into your storage capacity. It acts like a cache to your HDD so your HDD will perform better, ie load games faster, boot faster etc."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Does the laptop feel warm after long hours 3 or 4 hours
Sent from Google PIXEL 2 using GAGT"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"They do have the SSD plus HDD. For HDD, you can only select up to 1TB. I had select 2TB HDD and my selected 256GB SDD is removed automatically. I didn't notice the SSD was removed and thus I bought 1 without SSD.
Ok, will forgo the Optane and stick to 1 SSD and 1HDD. Thanks bro."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Easy bro - For Windows just download the ISO from Microsoft. Use media creation tool. Follow steps.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,Agree. The cooling isn't very good also but that's probably par for the course when it comes to gaming laptops. Hard to gauge

Options are:
""High Performance Mode"" and ""Quiet Mode""
I played around with it a little and didn't really see any difference. By default it was on High Performance.
Really appreciate the thread, it helped me decide to give the L340 Gaming GTX1650 a try. So I thought I'd give back since I finally found where that 'simple flick' switch is.
All the best,

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"well, i found these thread after i bought the GTX1050 version which i have to make a decision because my 1st gen i5 laptop decide to died on me
and i did watched a couple of yt reviews.
i'm pretty much does just casual ""retro"" gaming aka emulating retro consoles, i.e. PS2, gamecube, still looking for xbox solution
and honestly, i don't know **** about gaming pc
but my choice of getting just the 1050 version was purely base of my past experience with emulators graphic.
and migrating from 1st to now 9th gen i7 high performance cpu just make me WOWWW...."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"damn, there's like 4 sizes and i google the ssd used by the OEM aka samsung mzvlb512hajq-000l7, NVMe PCIe M.2 512GB.
yup, the longest among all sizes."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I came across this extender and similar stuff on ebay, under 2 bucks.
Guess you don't need to repurchase another if their of the same spec but simply extend it.
And I think you can also DIY it by getting a perfboard from simlim tower."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Anybody facing the problem of their laptop's keyboard not working after all the latest updates? The bios and drivers updates through the lenovo vantage, the windows updates etc. I have to do system restore back to a previous point as device manager keeps showing different error codes about the system registry... weird."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Keyboard is ok for me but power-up button is lit up even when battery is almost fully charged. Didn't notice that before. Not a big issue for me, so I'm just ignoring it."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Thanks bro, I bought a new one and is working now.
For those who wanna know which SSD confirms will work. I am using Crucial P1 500GB NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 Internal SSD. But I think any ""NVMe PCIe"" should work.
Lenovo technical support can only confirm up to 512GB will work, he can't confirm for 1TB. Below is their reply:
""Thank you for contacting Lenovo Technical Support.

We aren't sure if 1TB will be supported or not as there might be a compatibility issue. Kindly head to the nearest service centre to confirm on this sir."""
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Can't seem to access lenovo website via shopback.com...
Is the link down?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"nope, everything seems fine here but i think thats because i totally don't bother about vantage, i only go for the regular windows update.
and any update that dues with the onboard hardware, i will probably not go for it. well, if its not broken don't fix it. i have similar experience with my previous hp laptop, the hdmi output simply stop working after updated the graphic driver."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"good to know that. now i want to add a secondary sata drive but don't know where the ribbon port is located on the motherboard and further more i don't even know where to get the adapter itself
any clue??"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"abit sian hais, went into the registry to edit some codes using some online tutorials. dont even know how long this fix will last and if future updates will affect it.. will see how it goes."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,still dk why the laptop doesnt come with the sata cable to install the drive if we opt for the non HDD L340 models. I believe other models like the Y540 does come with them included in the box
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Ya, very troublesome. i mean how much does it cost, 50 cents? its just a piece of plastic attached to a cable.
I found the part # but the only website with stock is selling it >US$50 !! WTF"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"L340 AMD or Intel better ? I am using for web surfing, youtube and just light gaming"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"think you got it wrong, L340 is the ideapad series.
well, you never go wrong by choosing intel unless price is the issue."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"i am refering to the below 2 laptos for the L340 series. The AMD one is cheaper than the intel version so i am wondering if there is a significant difference between the two.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"AMD chipset seem better on paper but both are not in any case performance CPU.
and most definitely both variation will endup thermal throtter themself especially for those config that only comes with integrated graphic when chip run into any performance bottleneck.
meaning, without any sort of third party graphic, those model can handle older or less graphic intensive games.
but if you try to run e.g. street fighter 5 the system will endup like a toaster and slow like a snail."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I just ordered one from the Lenovo website. For mates who also ordered there, may I know what was your delivery duration?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"quote myself.
Free Gift is 1TB lenovo portable HDD"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"For free gift, I think have to cut out the sticker label from box and with the receipt, go down to redemption center @ Havelock Road to collect.
I collected mine freebies early part of last month.
Nobody will respond to email enquiry one.... coz it is stated very clearly in Lenovo brochure"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Be very careful when u do ur ShopBack! I didnt get my cash back.. they say Lenovo couldnt capture it even though I followed their steps.
What a waste! could have saved $120 more.."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"no, I just email them with my order number, etc.
and yes, their customer service in charge of email is very bad and sucks. I had to go to their Live Chat to disturb them twice to check and reply my email before they process the redemption.
they mail the free portable HDD to my house like they did with the laptop"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,how much did paid for including delivery charges?
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"i think the redemption center you guys mention is letrain.....
don't bother about contacting them they simply don't care, i tried.

The above plus extended 1 year basic warranty is 1209 SGD. This is after taking into account the COUPO code has took off 18%
As for the add on bundle, only the Lenovo 300 Wireless Compact Mouse was 10 cents so I took that. The rest costed more so I didn't.
Edit: I also bought via the shopback. Which was at 5% cashback last week. And delivery was free."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,So how long does the processing and delivery from the website take? Mine is the customized option.
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"well, i got it in store at HN. thats the only way to get ""free"" upgrade + i have a peace of mind for wat i got.
you could probably do a live chat with lenovo to find out the status."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"28% off now, with shopback 5%, total of 33%

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"This laptop really is a very value buy. I got it ard 3 months ago. Now playing rise of the tomb raider with reccomended settings. It's really smooth and good for such value. The night light and sound effects are good too, off the light and play at night is intense enough.

because someone in comment mention about Aftershock laptop, its seem to have really good spec for it price too.
you can get RTX2060 under 2k..."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Ohh. Im not hardcore gamer, so 1650 actually pretty decent got me imo. I also got budget issue. Before l340, I almost wanna get the aftershock apex lite at 1550. But after much consideration I got the l340 at 1.2 same specs. So still OK ba.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,how to get this 28% off? lenovo website also dun seem to have shopback. i have the shopback addin installed in chrome but it is not indicating anything
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"i'm also a casual gamer, mostly on emulating console, i.e. PS, PS2, gamecube.
so i pick the 1050 version to save some bucks though it running a 9750h.
but to be honest, even for emulation, if i start doing xbox360, basically runs into bottleneck with 1050
so i recently look into custom built, Aftershock definitely worth take a look, with just slight over 1k i can get a RTX power house."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Yea.. That's great. But u need to add in monitor. Decent one would be ard 300++. But my circumstance doesn't allow me to have a desktop so I can't consider it no matter how valuable it might have been.

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"actually my thought is to just use my existing LCD/LED lit TV as monitor because thats my primary viewing device.
its over 30inch with good viewing angle so i can be anywhere in the room still able to enjoy whats on the display. its not full HD but i don't have picky eyes either.
and i still have full TV function for under $300.
take a look at PHILIPS or LG, you can probably find a TV thats under $200.
LCD/LED TV technology is so mature now that with a known brand you hardly get a bad quality one."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"About a week plus of on and off usage, here are some preliminary feedbacks:
1. Machine is fast and very happy with it;
2. Finger-prints magnet on the keyboard surface;
3. Been having a lot of typos due to not getting used to the keyboard configuration;
4. Weird to have all ports on the left. Mouse wired has to go one round behind the laptop;
5. Backlit keyboard is cool;
6. Laptop is considered heavy for me."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"This laptop seems to be value for money for the performance and specifications it offers and I'm thinking of it as the next replacement for my aging 2013 MacBook Pro.
My requirements are not that heavy as I don't game, I just need a daily driver to do 4K video editing from my camera and DJI Osmo Mobile, Photoshop edits and some GPU-intensive Google Earth Studio animations without any lag or hiccups. Will be using it in the near future for uni as well for programming and DBA projects.

Anyone can tell what is the difference between the 2 models? Same specs, different price."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Hello,
Has any of You experienced problems with certain keys stopping to work/working randomly ? For me the problem is A and S keys, i observed that it may be connected with temperature in that region of keyboard. Especially that i think that keys are stopping to work mostly under high load/temperature.
Any feedback highly appreciated, I am going to use warranty for that as it makes notebook unusable in certain cases."
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Guys who have the i7-9750H versioon, can I ask how much you've undervolted by? I've seen values online of people undervolting this laptop everywhere from -0.115 to -0.160 and I was wondering what most people have settled on for the long-term?"
Lenovo Ideapad L340,"I reached a stable -1.45..

Any thoughts on this? The graphics chip abit unclear, not sure how entry level GPU is this, comparing with newer Nvidia MX350 2GB DDR5. I need it for work, light photo editing and some casual gaming.
Im comparing with Acer Nitro 5 $1298~$1399. These have better specs.. GTX 1650 4GB VRAM. The cheaper one is Ryzen 5 3550H or i5. The more exp one is i7 10th gen. 8GB RAM. But one thing I cant accept is the vulgar gamer style design."

Lenovo Ideapad L340,"Hey everyone,
Another quick update about L340.
So after nearly a year of usage, It went for a warranty repairs. The problem with the keyboard keys A and S - caused most likely by heat.
At first the keys were stopping to work/working randomly after/during long gaming sessions. It ended up that they were working randomly they react for presses randomly - mostly not reacting at all since cold boot the entire time now.
I hope its just some keyboard soldering issue or anything.
This + the fact that the BIOS doesn't have option to turn off USB power after notebook is turned off, are the 2 drawbacks of this model that I've found so far."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Previous generation of AMD Ryzen based laptop like Think E485/E585 was rather popular.
I will update here the newer gen models which are:
Thinkpad E495 AMD Ryzen - No review yet
Thinkpad E595 AMD Ryzen -
Pros
+very good input devices
+contrast-rich, bright IPS display
+good CPU performance
+fairly quiet
+good SSD
+GPU a lot faster than Intel UHD graphics
+very constant performance without drops
Cons
-only microSD reader
-GPU performance throttled no dual-channel RAM
-1x USB 2.0
-weak color-space coverage
Thinkpad T495 AMD Ryzen Pro - No review yet
Thinkpad X395 AMD Ryzen Pro - No review yet
AMD Ryzen chips are unlike older generation, now most Ryzen APU chips offer well rounder performance for both CPU + GPU.
On par with Intel mobile chips while the integrated Radeon Vega graphics trash Intel UHD easily.
But for gaming discrete graphics will still outperform integrated Radeon graphics since it lack dedicated VRAM.
In SG the above are decent models whether for work, light gaming and etc.
The E series are budget while T and X are premium line.
Take note AMD Ryzen Pro features and cooling are different from
AMD Ryzen consumer.
Which to pick depend on your budget and usage.
Generally E series are decent enough.
Take note for what I know AMD based Thinkpad are sold online, have yet to see any retail shop selling it.
In SG there are other AMD Ryzen based laptop such as:
ASUS X512DA *Uses HDD not SSD
ASUS FX550DT Gaming laptop uses AMD H chips
No other models I have seen so far so AMD Ryzen laptop are rather rare."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Good price. I was playing around with it, and by adding a 1080P IPS monitor +25, and upgrade to 16GB ram +110. All for 925."

There's the 1 cents upgrade also.
Can't figure out whether can upgrade to Ryzen 7 to find out the cost."
Lenovo Thinkpad,At the moment don't see option for Ryzen 7.
Lenovo Thinkpad,seems like the basic specs like really not bad though. just that not sure how is the temp of the system. although 1.75kg seems like quite okay weight not too heavy and light though
Lenovo Thinkpad,better look at the interior design before purchasing

Lenovo Thinkpad,Maybe website on update?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes but take note for lappy with Mx150.
On default is Intel HD, geforce only kick in during game and etc.
AMD wise one chip and on default is Vega 11 so no switching."
Lenovo Thinkpad,any known heat issues with ryzen 5?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I have a slight concern on the heat dissipation issue with AMD processor too. I am  looking at the 14"" one. I wonder why the 256GB SSD which should hold the Win 10 OS is installed as 2nd drive while the 1st drive is left empty. Isn't the system drive is always installed as 1st drive? Anyone here can enlighten me?
I went AddOn at Bugis Junction this afternoon, trying to take a look at the actual notebook. But I was told it is only available online."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not bashing Intel.
Try using a Intel H 6 core with 1050 graphic lappy.
That lappy is have is really hot.
Ryzen 5 is 15watt APU so unlikely to have hot issues since it is low wattage.
U can read review on laptop based on it, they did not mention about overheating."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I am more concern with the battery life. It's 45w only so does it last at least 5 hours ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Based on capacity, probably not. But with a 768p display, it probably could."
Lenovo Thinkpad,seems like HP might bring in AMD specs as well.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes the HP Envy X360 as well as Probook/Elitebook.
However not below $1k."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Heat problem or not, we will only know if we try it. This is running a 15W processor which I feel should not be a big concern with the thick chassis on this ThinkPad.
I think it is just a perception that if it is AMD, it will run hot. To give you a little comparison, my Lenovo Miix 720 with a i5 7200U could hit over 80 degs under load."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Review on Ideapad 720S which is also fitted with Ryzen 5 2500U indicate inadequate cooling leading to throttling of processor under heavy load. Let's hope Lenovo has learnt the lesson and made necessary improvement on these new models.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For those who assume AMD is hot.
Do not based on the preception of Ideapad 720s as that one
is Lenovo lazy design.
As they recycle the design from Intel version and think it
will work but it failed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You can read the previous gen Thinkpad A275 based on AMD Bristol Ridge.

No mention about overheating except slow system performance.
The 2500U is 15Watt TDP so unlikely to overheat.
Unless processor like Intel H series 6 core rated at 45watt TDP,
the temp under load can go as high as 80 degrees.
If we are talking about processor with 45W TDP than perhaps but
it is 15Watt TDP.
Anyway for those who think AMD is slow and hot don't get it.
Not citing AMD still have the issue if you are not comfortable
or confidential in AMD laptop than just get Intel.
Most Intel laptop comes with Intel UHD and optional graphics
like Geforce/Radeon which means more $.
AMD Ryzen based laptop is one chip with decent CPU and Vega graphics.
On default for AMD laptop will be Vega while Intel is the crappy UHD.
That is why most laptop for Intel usually comes with discrete graphic
as Intel UHD is CMI.
Intel UHD have to be enabled to save power especially on battery."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just ordered one @ $815.03 this morning for my daughter as her Acer Aspire 5 is getting old and we would not want to have sudden failure in notebook interrupting her course work. Chosen 2x4GB ram, 65W charger and Win10 Home since her don't play games and her course work has no video editing, should not be too taxing on memory and processing power. Just hope everything goes well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I've not seen the chassis used by the ThinkPad, but realistically, any thin profile laptops tend to suffer from throttling. It is just a matter of how much it gets throttled. The same applies to Intel's 15W processors too. Case in point, my Lenovo Miix 720.
Even assuming that thermals is not the issue, 15W processors will still throttle because of the low power limit. This is especially the case when you are gaming because both the CPU and GPU are under load."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"One thing do take note is after you got the unit.
Do a fresh install of the OS than load all the driver properly.
Out of the box OS usually are slow and bloated with junks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I don't do this. For me, I will just go in an remove all the bloatware that I don't use and run a registry cleaner, e.g. CCleaner. Even Win 10 itself will install rubbish like Candy Crush and a bunch of other games.
Nowadays with SSDs, slowness due to too many apps is not that apparent as those mechanical drive days where I will always format my PC/ laptops annually to spur it back to a ""speedy"" state."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Noted with thanks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"True. I have been running my Intel E8400 desktop Win 10 with only 4GB DDR2 RAM for some time. Simple word processing and web browsing are no problem. With latest intel processor and 8GB DDR4 RAM, the performance should be faster than my present desktop except for video perhaps. But then my daughter does not play PC games."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Please post your thoughts when you get it. Tia
Lenovo Thinkpad,"With Win 10, a SSD is almost a must if you want a responsive PC. With the mechanical drive being the significantly slowest part in the PC nowadays, it will take a toll on performance/ responsiveness big time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"on specs it puts 2700..
but don't seem to have this option?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I cant access the customisation page for 485/585 on both web and mobile. Anyone else facing the same issue?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Not bad leh
Lenovo Thinkpad,for me is e485. lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,Why not? You can go to the link shared on the first post and go back one page where it says ThinkPad E Series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just playing around a bit with the E485 customization, and I feel this is the better size for a laptop. Also some options are quite good to upgrade or downgrade,
1 Display - Upgrade to full HD,
2 Memory - Upgrade to 2x8GB DDR4 2400
3 Second Hard disk - I chose to downgrade since I have spare PCI-E/ NVME SSDs to upgrade. Downgrade to 128GB saves 70 bucks.
4 Power cord - Default is 45W. Upgrade to 65W with rapid charge for +2 bucks should be a must upgrade.
All in, 857. Superb price."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Same as my customization,  I presume we still can add a 2.5 into the laptop?
Sent from Sony Z4 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"They have the option of another secondary drive, and there looks like mechanical drive options in there. So I think it is save to assume that there is space for a spare drive."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Think can add a HDD. Iirc a 1tb is $65
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ermm none of u is concern with the 1x1 wifi specs?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"There is a 2x2 Wifi FRU but is Realtek model
FRU number 01AX739
No need to thank me"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Oops, thought I saw QCA QCNFA435AC with Bluetooth Version 4.1, and there's no option to upgrade in the E485 configuration page.
Did I miss something?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes total FRUs != Available on Configuration Page
FRU = Whitelisted in Lenovo BIOs
If you know how to mod Lenovo BIOs every Lenovo PCIe card also pin compatible.
Nowadays due to RSA signing need to use external flasher to mod BIOs. All the pin straps protected"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Don't worry so much about the WiFi card. The fact of the matter is that for the past 2 years, Lenovo had quietly removed the WiFi whitelist from the system firmware in Thinkpad laptops. The WWAN card whitelist is still in place though.
So all you need to do is just buy from Lazada / eBay / <insert random e-commerce site here> any 2x2
M.2
WiFi card, install it into the Thinkpad and it will work. Don't need to specifically get a Lenovo FRU.
Anybody who claims that Thinkpads still use firmware whitelists, mini-PCIe WiFi cards and still employs a legacy BIOS is living under a rock."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wah its like u guys did a deep check on what's Lenovo is doing. Well I'm pretty much concern of WiFi card as well since as u said 1X1 and 4.1v which I it's pretty common among some budget laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For the price and specs on a ThinkPad, something has got to give. And if it is the WiFi, then can consider changing it. Worst case just get an external one and leave the internal one in case you want to lug it out."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Looks like these are out of stock now. Luckily managed to hoot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"E series is always budget laptop. L is another low budget laptop series.
The real higher end business laptops are X followed by T series.
Price is right for a budget laptop. Nothing to shout about other than the AMD X-factor here."
Lenovo Thinkpad,its back on the web liao
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Is the speed for this kind of SSD fast?
Second Hard Drive : 256GB Solid State Drive PCIe OPAL2.0 M.2 2280 16GT/s"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Could be the usual OEM SSD like Samsung 951 that kind  I think?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I hope it's comparable to the one on the xiaomi laptop pro 15.6"""
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I doubt they will use a Samsung SSD for a budget laptop. At this price range, it could be a Liteon SSD."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Come in ssrr.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I have a LiteOn M.2 SSD in a laptop. Two years later, slow until i thought my mouse got problem never click the folder properly, turns out its just damn slow
. Terrible, would not recommend."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I am just speculating cause I did not buy this ThinkPad. I only suspect they may use the likes of Liteon since it is a common OEM brand.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yep.. my last Acer laptop was using a 512gb liteon.. very slow compared to Samsung..
Sent from Xiaomi MI MAX using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Most manufacturer won't add in a speedy SSD because of $.
If they add in Samsung SSD, the overall price will jack up a fair bit.
They usually use cheap SSD brand like LiteOn, Toshiba.
Sandisk also very rare seriously, even if they use Sandisk it
will be X series which is intended for OEM market
and low power type not speed.
My Dell G3 is using Sandisk X600, not a speedy drive but
it is decent enough.
As for WIFI, it's a E series Thinkpad which means budget.
Unlike T series you won't have option for better WIFI
or even LTE.
Take note if this E series sell well, maybe they will sell the
A series.
A series will be the premium version like last time there was
E475 and A475."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The laptop did not come with the mouse and case? If not, did they put down how long is the shipping?
Just ordered one too. Thanks"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya, they ship separately, you can track your order from the email. It takes about a week or 2."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"+1
Dont expect top quality for such a price. I think the specs are good enough for the price."
Lenovo Thinkpad,That is my point below $1k unlikely to have better specs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It's the only 16gb ram laptop I can find for this price, with the bonus of usb c charging. So fair enough. The next best thing would be a aftershock p-13"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I believe I've used Liteon SSD's previously, and in fact, I still have a Liteon Zeta mSata SSD. It is not blazing fast like Samsung, but I don't think it is lacking in any way. SSD is still a better alternative as compare to a mechanical drive."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not when my desktop 5 year old Samsung 850 TLC? SSDCan't remember.. the model with lower write cycles seems to be faster
Sent from Xiaomi MI MAX using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think you mean 840 Evo?
Anyway like I said, SSD is still better than giving us a 5400 rpm drive. For day to day usage, I don't think it is a problem. You likely will only see how fast when running benchmarks. Even the Intel X25 160GB G2 that I still have, is still good enough and I don't experience any lag whatsoever."
Lenovo Thinkpad,You can always opt for the cheapest storage option and do your own upgrade. Lenovo is not a custom/ DIY desktop and laptop manufacturer. So it is to be expected that they will sell you a full and working laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I opt for a 512 GB drive. If it turns out to be a crap drive, just dump it into an USB 3 enclosure and use your own drive"
Lenovo Thinkpad,really? which brand and model?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For those interested in the review of the E485 and 585, you can check out the link below. Based on this link, the E480 and 580 should use pretty much the same chassis/ design as the Intel version of it.
Cooling is not good most likely due to the cooling solution having to handle both the Intel CPU and dedicated GPU. But for Ryzen, it only needs to cool a single chip."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"how does this amd setup compare to i5+mx150?
good enuff to play dota?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"As in the e485 configuration, I opted for 512gb."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It is not as fast compared to an i5 and MX150 combination, but is not very far away in terms of performance. Dota should not be an issue for the Ryzen APU, but subjected to the graphical settings. It definitely will lag if you run at native resolution with all the graphical settings jacked up."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just take note for those intending to change HDD, it may void
the warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,What I meant is the SSD
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Doesn't mention in website.
With almost foc upgrade to 3 year warranty. It's a very good deal. Can't buy now as my notebook is still working ok."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think if there is no warranty seal, it may not be a problem. What I used to do is to pull out the hard disk and store it somewhere without deleting the data in there. If the laptop is faulty, I just slap the old drive back and bring it back for repairs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I think opting for a 512gb SSD is a better option than choosing 16gb ram
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Both have their pros and cons. But the good thing is whatever you did not upgrade at the point of purchase, you can upgrade later since both hard disk and RAM appears to be user upgradeable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ram will be tricker as you want to ensure dual channel for the graphics. Therefore you might need to swop both ram sticks if you need an upgrade.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"When you are running VMs, you will need it......"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"While this is indeed something to consider, I believe the system nowadays may not need a matched pair to run dual channel. At least in 1 of the instance I noticed it was running dual channel even without a matching pair.
For me, I will go for the ram upgrade because +110 is quite a good price."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If it is me, I will just:
SSD - Boot drive
HDD - Data and etc.
Like my current laptop SSD + HDD.
Take note SSD have wear level, if it reach it's intended write cycle
it will fail."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Erm.... Dual channel is like raid 0, double the speed but absolutely require 2 stick of ram to work together. But you are right that it doesn't require a matching pair.
If your default configuration is 8gb, it make sense to set it as dual 4gb to maximise the igp. When you switch one of the ram stick to 8 gb, 4gb + 4gb will run as dual channel while the last 4gb will run as single channel. This may affect the igp performance if it has to switch to single channel part of the time.
Single channel, the speed is reduced by half. The ram speeds advertised is based on dual channel.
Check CPUz for your system ram speed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"A 256gb will typically start to display errors at the limit of its write cycle, which is at about 350TB written data. That means 3 years to 4 years of use if you rewrite your ssd with 256gb every single day. For a 512gb, it is double the amount. Also a 512gb will be faster than a 256gb  theoretically.
To avoid ssd damage, it is recommended to reduce page file usage and use solely the ram.
Don't worry about ssd outliving your systems unless you are swapping huge amount of memory every second. Servers maybe?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"True, page file on SSD is bad so have to turn it off or
set it to second drive if there is."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"shipped out of china already, should be in SG by this weekend."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Generally, I feel apart from doing some basic config to ensure that the OS is not unnecessarily wearing out the SSD, I don't think there is anything to worry. Just use it as normal. I used to feel that installing too many things on the SSD will kill it eventually. So I start installing some applications on my mechanical drive. After sometime, I thought it is quite dumb why so protective of the SSD. After all, it is meant to be used. Even if the NAND don't fail, any parts in there may potentially fail and the SSD will be dead either way."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"UPS delivery is fark up.....
I called UPS on thursday to ask when is the delivery, they say either Friday or Sat, ask me call them on Friday morning to confirm the schedule. I went home on Thursday to see a note from UPS saying attempted delivery.  Called them to ask wtf is going on, they just say delivery man on the way so just deliver.....
So nevermind, i schedule for delivery on friday after 2 pm...they say cannot, delivery time is 9 am to 6 pm and dependent on the route which the delivery man uses...so cannot schedule timing... but i cannot stay home the whole day just to wait for a parcel right....so CSO say ok i arrange after 7 pm for u. So i have been home from 7 pm till now, still waiting.... And i got a feeling its not coming tonight..... haizzzz"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lol. They just delivered the mouse to me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,i got the mouse and case already...waiting for the laptop only
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Normally by 9 pm and you don't get it, most likely you won't get it. Most delivery companies have sort of a cut off time. There are couple of cases where I still received them at 10+ pm."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Actually if possible test the battery life..
Lenovo Thinkpad,"ppl also quite bz le, n beside the battery life is dependent on how the person use it"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I don't need a thorough test.. just based on normal surfing, streaming and some light gaming.
Sent from Xiaomi MI MAX using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"UPS same as other couriers, delivery window whole day. Ever they delivered an item at 10pm before. Only one which can schedule specific window and date in my experience is DHL."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"We can expect idle battery life to be less than Intel as they are still not as efficient at lower clock rates. But for low to medium consistant usage of processor, we can expect similar battery life as Intel, minus a few percent.You can refer to those benchmarks from e480reviews, assuming similar components are used.
However, take note a processor battery usage can be as low as 1/4 of a system, therefore the LCD panel, igp and mainboard battery usage is of importance as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lenovo mentioned that it's up to 13 hours. So without intense gaming I expect it to last at least 9 hours
Sent from Xiaomi MI MAX using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I will not put too much stock into that...... Cheaper LCDs and wifi card does not translate to better power efficencies.
Based on a 45wh battery, with an expected 6 to 8 watt usage, I think 6-7 hours usage is about right.
If you switch off wifi, read only PDFs and at low brightness, then maybe 8 to 10 hrs.
On the bright side, a ""USB PD"" power bank can charge the laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You should take what they market with a lot of salt. So far, I have seen many optimistic claims, but fell far short. Reasonably, you should see at least 6 plus hours with light usage. Intense gaming, the numbers will plunge to about an hour or 2 max."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"At load, I suspect the Intel based E480/580 may experience shorter battery life as it needs to supply the dedicated GPU with additional power."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"erm... depends on what kind of load you are talking about. CPU load? Games? Videos Transcoding?
If doing heavy gaming or video transcoding, I doubt anybody will expect more than 2.5 hours on either the e485 amd or e480 intel with graphics, which makes the discussion on battery life irrelevant. An extra 20 mins of battery is not going to bring much value. The dedicated graphics don't kick in unless the IGP cannot handle."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I wonder if this model really isn't selling well.. not even a single youtube review so far..
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This model E485 is not sold worldwide, only certain country have.
Which shockingly SG is among them to have it.
Most Thinkpad user will opt for Intel than AMD.
Review may come like from Notebookcheck website.
But I think maybe within the next 6 months or so."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"In 6 months, this model will be considered obsolete

Lenovo Thinkpad,aiya most consumers have been brainwashed that AMD CPU is inferior and heat up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Mine is shipped!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes that is the common perception about AMD.
Hot and slow.
But that is like very long long ago."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For heavy gaming, I am pretty sure it won't last for more than an hour and a half unless it throttles both CPU and GPU. Some laptops do that when running on battery.
While dedicated graphics don't kick in at idle, the GPU still needs power to allow it to switch quickly. Also in this case, we are looking at an AMD GPU in the E480 with Intel processor. The last I heard, AMD drivers to allow iGPU and dGPU switching is not as refine as what we find with Nvidia."

Heat issues - Its running cooler than my current 4 year old Asus Intel laptop for sure. The Fan is also quieter.
Battery life - didn't have the chance to fully test it. Charging was pretty fast, full charge was about 1 hr + on the 45W charger. There are different modes 4 modes i think for you to choose while on Battery, I was on better performance mode2nd best and battery indicated it will last about 5hr +.

Lenovo Thinkpad,i presume previously clearing old stocks thats y offload them cheap but cant do cpu config.
Lenovo Thinkpad,is the 2700u option a better one over the 2500u?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Personally, I feel the R7 2700U is likely not much better than the 2500U even with the higher end GPU and clockspeed. Problem boils down to the power limit set by the manufacturer. If they keep it strictly at 15W and 25Wboost, then I would expect the R7 to throttle more when it hits the limit."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I don't think they are clearing old stock. Anyway, I suspect it could be 1 GSS and 2 to entire tertiary students buying new laptops."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Found this.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Those are desktop CPUs, not notebook CPUs"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyway, unless there is a very good cooling system on the laptop, a faster apu might throttle, resulting in slower sustained speed. For that price, I doubt it will be an excellent cooling system."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"At 8% average cpu utilization, 2% average gpu utilization, wifi on, 50% brightness, It lasted 4 hours 37 mins. Quite terrible stats...
I will try again tonight after optimizing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Try clean reinstall then AMD Drivers from AMD Website. Also need Lenovo Power Management Driver
The processor must boost until 100% when running CPUZ Benchmark if required under power options set minimum CPU utilization 55%.
On my Ryzen 1700 on Windows Server processor must be set to 55% otherwise clock will be stuck
Must use HWMonitor to check the processor state."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Cinebench 15 shows good results and outperform the i7 8550 in multicore. I will say that have to fine-tune the processor for geekbench as mentioned by artic. Try tonight
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If after update driver to latest still isn't performing.
Maybe try do fresh install of OS cuz
Stock OS usually comes with bloatware.
Whether or not the image was done on Intel NB u never know.
Yes I saw some AMD NB with such image.
Inside there few software like Intel UHD graphics."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Minor review.
1. I set the processor to 100% and it managed to get a much better score on geekbench, but still not pushing the processor 100%.
2. Cinebench 15 shows that it outperforms i7 8550u by 5% on multicore and lose by 10% on single core. I will say it performed really well. No thermal throttling that I can see.
3. 3dMark skydiver shows a score of 800, which is very close to the dedicated mx150 GPU in most ultrabooks. MX 150 in Ultrabooks is usually slightly throttled because of heat
4. SSD performance is really good. The 512 GB samsung has a sequential read of 2.7GB per second and write of 2GB per second. 4k read writes are about 10 - 20% better than the E480 review on notebookcheck. However, the ssd controller temp went up to 98 degree. SSD brand is a lottery, so don't expect samsung in every laptop. Your mileage will vary
5. Screen brightness is quite low and I will expect to use 50% brightness in a well lit room, in comparison to the usual 25% for my other laptops. The matt display is great although I can see very faint bleeding at the bottom. Acceptable for this price.
6. I managed to squeeze 7 hours out of this laptop by setting max cpu to 70% so it will not turbo boost in battery. However, the lowest possible clock I can get it to go consistently is at 1.6ghz. My settings are: Wifi on, 25% brightness, 2.5% average cpu utilization, 10% average highest cpu core utilization. If you are consistently visiting javascript heavy or ad heavy webpages like hardwarezone, then expect your ""average highest cpu core utilization"" to spike and as a result, much heavier power usage. I will say on average, a uptime of 4 to 6 hour is very achievable. However, it is still poorer than a intel chip. I will expect intel to have an extra 20 - 30% extra runtime.
7. It can be charged or run from a external USB PD powerbank. A 100 wh powerbank will easily give an extra 150% - 180% more battery life to you on the road.
8. It is a thinkpad keyboard.
9. In conclusion, I think this laptop is a fantastic buy if you want to game occasionally or require 16 GB ram for multi tasking / development work, despite the ""subpar"" wifi. In everyday usage, wifi is not expected to be a bottleneck, so it is not a factor in my review.  I hope this can be of help to those considering this laptop."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Better to buy the another 500 GB HDD or just get external SDD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"external. the internal HDD is pretty useless. u might as well..
1. upgrade the NVME to get powerful top speed
OR
2. change a SATA SSD yourself cheaper - buy from outside."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ordered Thinkpad E585 liao
AMD Ryzen 7
16GB 8+8
FHD IPS screen
512GB SSD
65W
Total : $987.03
Now can the first drive be slotted another 512 GB SSD or need to do some further upgrade?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No need any upgrade. Just buy and slot it.
Mine is 955.03 everything same as yours except
E485, 1x16GB, 256GB and 45W"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"256GB for 955, I hoot 512GB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I did not hoot the 512GB. E485 512GB is +$120...
Lenovo Thinkpad,華 要是成功將記憶體ram提升至16gb，選擇哪一個處理器能夠操作到電腦輔助設計軟體atocad咧？

Lenovo Thinkpad,"如果你係由$890配置開始客制自己要嘅系統。。。無論有或無操作系統，一樣扣$90。
我係選擇有 。"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Same price for windows 10 home or without
Lenovo Thinkpad,can I check if this is capable of handling solidworks?
Lenovo Thinkpad,based on the above link. Yes. Extremely capable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Any good recommendation for a second compatible 512GB SSD and other required tools to open or mount the SSD.
Don't know if the SSD are can hold 2 pieces if not, I intend to use the empty 2.5 inch HDD slot"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"no. only 1. Samsung SSD is good.
don't understand your rationale of having two pieces. If you want to do RAID, go get a computer or a fatter notebook."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The other sdd for software cache and files before storage.
I read some thinkpad models need to buy a small rack or cover to hold the SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is it better to get 1x 16GB ram or 2x 8GB ram?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Dual channel better. I get 1 coz i have another ram lying around
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks! Btw is this the best value laptop as of now? I actually been looking at getting a new laptop for almost 2 months already. I see the usual intel ones but thought of just wait awhile more. I thought of trying out a Ryzen laptop hence looking into this Thinkpad. I don't think are other Ryzen laptops selling in SG right?

Lenovo Thinkpad,"I chatted with the HP store customer service agent Malaysia store one, but doesn't matter because Singapore store one also use the same office
I can buy both the laptop and 3-year warranty from the Malaysia online store, bring it to Singapore and the warranty will be valid in Singapore because the model is supported in Singapore. Only RM3980 about $1350"

Looking at comparing between E485 and E585 but for some reason with the same configuration E485 is around $210 more expensive as compared to E585 due to the preconfigured Window 10 home and SSD size."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"But iirc e485 is 14"" and e585 is 15"" but all configuration is almost the same selections."
Lenovo Thinkpad,its down to weight vs size. if u dun mind a few hundred grams n a bigger screen get E585
Lenovo Thinkpad,The card will changed to vegas 10 if you upgrade the CPU to Ryzen 7

Lenovo Thinkpad,Wouldn't that be worst than what the guy state?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Was thinking of future upgrades for the WiFi module and the HDD slot, saw this
on the tear down and i realize that there is a HDD bracket and ribbon cable to be connected to the mobo, if we didn opt for any HDD i dont think they will give us any bracket and ribbon cables right? anybody bought the laptop and did some upgrade them self?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,$1.6-$1.9k is already Latitude 5000/Probook/Thinkpad L tier. Overpriced unless you really like the aesthetics and keyboard layout on the Envy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,When mine arrive i try and tell u
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I see that there is an option to add in the 45w or 65w power cord. Then over at the accessories page, there is an option to add in the 45w or 65w charger.
If I don't select any charger, does that mean I will not receive any charger at all?

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Looking forward, mine scheduled to ship end of the month.
I doubt so, the accessories page gives you additional accessories such as additional power brick and more, you will still receive the power brick that comes with the laptop you ordered."

After $250 discount code,
Your Price:
SG$932.03"
Lenovo Thinkpad,your invoice will state you have one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks. Why is 2x8GB ram better than 1x 16GB ram?
One more question. I know this is using AMD and xiaomi laptop using intel. But how are they compared when the xiaomi one is about $1k but of coz with the crappy Chinese windows."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Depends on your usage also i guess, for me i'm not planning on doing any gaming on my laptop so a Ryzen 5 2500U will surface."
Lenovo Thinkpad,How you get $250 discount? I thought only $200 using AMD18?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This is a Thinkpad so the quality will be far better than the Xiaomi.
Not to mention it is intended for
business
use so it is made to last.
2 X 8GB will enable dual channel than 1 X 16 GB which will
improve the performance slightly."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks. Oh, should I have 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD or should I just have 512GB SSD? They will install windows in then SSD right?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"With an EDU account, can get $250 anytime.
I believe with SGNIGHT too can get the same discount value."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Apply the code IPRICE. Someone shared this code earlier. Valid till 26th Aug I think.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for your replies. Current code ""SGNIGHT"" has $250."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone can verified if the hdd connector will be inside although the hdd is not chosen in the configuration?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"imo, SSD much better than have HDD. Skip the HDD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"SGNIGHT, IPRICE and student account gives you $250"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think have... the screenhot is the internal of 485. We can see the cable front bracket.
Anyway Lenovo had put E480 / 485 and E580 / E585 as a group--1 with intel and the other with AMD CPU. Other forums had said 580 and 480 comes with dummy HDD and HDD ribbons, so 485 and 585 should have it too.
Mini review"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I noticed that the order sheet does mention dummy HDD as part of the deliverable also
Sent from HUAWEI BLA-L29 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"On the way from Lazada... all add in, good price for this laptop. Looks like a number of people buying these.
SAMSUNG SSD 860 EVO 500GB Up to 550MB/sec Sequential Read, Up to 520MB/sec Sequential Write
SGD187.90"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Best have two SSD and HDD.
SSD for OS and HDD for data.
In case if SSD fails, at least your data is on the HDD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think I ever read that the ssd has a write lifespan? For the order, ssd can only be chosen as the 2nd hard drive while hdd is the first hard drive. IBM wont be so stupid to install windows in the hdd instead of the ssd right?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"well yes it has written lifespan, but they are quite long if ur laptop usage is considered low/ minimum usage. Even high usage can last at minimum 5 years.for good endurance SSD
As for installation of OS, I doubt that they will install on HDD as well. So u need not to worry about it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I don't even know people are still so concern about the write endurance in a SSD.
A notebook u constantly have to power it on / off. Before the write endurance has used up, your hdd probably will die first over your SSD.
Even if it doesn't die it will have tons of sector allocation problems that provides you with extremely bad writing speed
Really lol"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I'd even dare say more SSDs die randomly than actually dying due to maxing out its endurance
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Usually OS is on SSD if not Windows 10 will crawl seriously.
Sadly SSD have lifespan, once it reach it's write endurance than...
Need not worry, SSD won't die that quick."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Good luck. Continue with HDD then. I believe those that said write endurance belongs to the group that opposed calculators from abacus era.
See what have happen in today's context."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"At which point did I ever state to stick with HDD over SSD for OS drive?
I was pointing out that even in the small size of SSD failures, more of it is probably down to random failure than actual endurance failure, enforcing your original point that write endurance is a non-issue.
How often have we seen posts of outright failure, versus actual posts of
""yo me SSD's dead after 3967TBW"".
Rarely it's the latter"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ok. Point taken. my bad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,The take away here is to have good backup habit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Chill. I dunno, thats why I ask for advice here. Purchased a laptop here based on the advice and recommendation. Thanks so much and thanks for the discount code."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is there a 13” model?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Have. But other models. The offer may not be as good. I am not sure also. The Lenovo website says idealpad and thinkpad has August promo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Onky Lenovo has amd ah
Lenovo Thinkpad,is it easy to access the slot? if I have 512ssd that slot will empty huh
Lenovo Thinkpad,"485 and 585 only the screen size difference?
comex also coming hor.. hmmszzzzz"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"based on youtube.. just unscrew and access. fairly easy.
ya, that slot will come with a Dummy HDD if you only selected 1xSSD"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Those PC exhibits in SG rarely have good deals 1.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"bros who recv E585, mind check is there gigabit ethernet?  thanks"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"How is the throttling issue for both e4 and e5 with ryzen 5
Posted with Audeze LCD-X HardwareZone Forums app"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Am I doing it right? Both same config with 16gb and 512GB SSD. 585 comes out about $100 cheaper.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I just ordered, almost exactly like yours except I chose 256GB SSD, so it looks right to me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,concerned of the throttling and compatibility...
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Pay the $2 more to get the 65W adaptor, which supports quick charging."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Its less than $1k, so ok la. Try lo. I think should be fine."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"$16, not $2. At least for my options."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, it's 16 for me too."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Would get both of them or the more expensive one if only 1 allowed, then purchase the cheaper one separately. 65W permanently at home, the marginally lighter and more packable 45W type-C to bring along when outside. It also means you don't have to unravel a charger to use at home."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i think he meant the 45W to 65W upgrade, E485 cost $2 to upgrade and E585 cost $16"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually, for E585, it shows $16, but when you add it it's just +$2.
Think reason is coz it's the price of the add-on and not the upgrade price 45w selection is $14, 65w is $16"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You are right, didn notice it when i check out. More reason to upgrade to 65w unless one really need the light weight factor"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For those that hooted, when will you be getting it?
Mine is still processing..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If diy put in the HDD, will void warranty by removing the back cover?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Mine the date keeps changing... No idea when
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Nope, shouldn't be the case. No warranty void screw stickers on Thinkpads unless they've changed it drastically."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No, the laptop is designed for you to upgrade."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"ok, then just get the ssd only option first, if need more storage next time then buy another ssd/hdd to put inside"
Lenovo Thinkpad,They put 31st August. Got tracking number.
Lenovo Thinkpad,good for you. mine no tracking number yet..
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone knows if the keyboard is backlit?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Not backlit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,I thought you placed order earlier than me. My mouse and case coming first on 27th. DHL. Laptop 31st if nothing screws up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,anyone considering a series over this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yup I received the mouse and old school bag. Notebook
expected
date keeps changing though.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Initially i am until i saw the cpu..
Lenovo Thinkpad,haa.. so which u ordered?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thinkpad E485... 585 too heavy for weak people like me...
Lenovo Thinkpad,350gsm to 400gsm or so difference only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,What's the difference?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"throw in the adapter and your other misc stuffs you got to carry...
400gram saving is godsend."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"1. light weight at 1.57KG
2. comes with Windows Hello and Fingerprint
3. touch screen"
Lenovo Thinkpad,ya but the processor.....
Lenovo Thinkpad,"im thinking of tt too. mainly a standby pc cos my macbook gg for servicing.

Lenovo Thinkpad,AMD older CPU BKY de. Ah Tiong bu take over CEO give it some juice.

Posted with Audeze LCD-X HardwareZone Forums app"
Lenovo Thinkpad,thx almost forget abt it. haa. will the IT show promo hav better deals?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ryzen ish ky de
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No idea man. You ask those regular promoters on edmw lo. Might be slightly better. But I dont want the hassle of going down in the last day, squeeze with the crowd, waste time, waste petrol, pay for parking etc etc. The savings, if any, not worth my time. Order online and wait for them to send to you, betterright?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Don't think IT show got thinkpads? Not the edge series at least...
Lenovo Thinkpad,i jus checked the benchmark of my 2013 macbook pro vs the 2018 ryden processor. i see no clear winner. almost on par. but a 2013I7-4750HQ vs 2018 ryden? i was expecting this to trash my 2013 laptop but shock its almost the same performance wise? am i missing something?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Mac jin satki man! Core i5 processor can run so fast, no wonder Apple sell Macbook Pro for so expensive and don't have to upgrade for many years  to come. That may be why Apple don't refresh often because it will run faster and better than newer CPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think it's cheaper right? For example I beo HP Envy 13"". Retail is $1499. Then last day previous show was $1300. Some manage to shave another $20."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can show link?
I'm shocked too"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Many reasons. Mainly the comparison is between top end 2013 2Ghz 4C/8T Intel vs current 2Ghz or 2.2 Ghz 4C/8T AMD not sure which Ryzen you refer, but give you benefit of doubt it is not the lowest end 4C/4T model. Intel's IPC didn't go up much over the years from 4xxx to 7xxx. So performance difference is not going to be ground-breaking.
Look instead at the TDP. i7-4750 is rated at 47Watt while Ryzen 2500U/2700U is rated at 15W. Benchmark per watt, is an improvement. Ryzen integrated Vega graphics is also a hugh improvement over Iris Pro in i7-4750hq.
Whereas, if you can afford the latest, MacBook Pro 13"", it is going to have Core i7-8559U quad-core: This has a base frequency of 2.7 and Turbo Boosts up to 4.5 GHz and is rated up to 28W. Going to trash Ryzen 2018 anyday,
MacBook Pro 15"" i9 2.9Ghz 6 core/12 threads part, no need to say already.
But then again, we are comparing a $2k~$3k MacBook Pro with a less than $1k AMD Thinkpad laptop. Budget wise, Ryzen wins hands-down.
ps. Just looked at my MacBook Pro 13"" 2015 model. It's a i5 2C/4T part. Already cost more than $2k+ at that time. How much did you pay for the i7 MacBook Pro in 2013?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"not just that. The OS is different as well. It plays a part too.
Try and install WinOS onto your mac. you will probably yield a different result."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"One real advantage of the Ryzen laptop would be the graphics part. The Vega graphics core can play most games, but in lower settings, of course."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Another user review and Huawei had a Matebook in Ryzen CPU too but they do not sell laptop in SG
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think this thinkpad is $250 off retail? Plus the $10 RAM upgrades and 1 cent warranty upgrade, I guess even at IT Show, might only be at most another $50 off. Not worth my time. My laptop scheduled to reach 30th Aug. seems like brought forward 1 day."
Lenovo Thinkpad,If you remove the $210 for the 16GB ram upg... The notebook cost extremely cheap already.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I dunno why people still want to hiam this and that.
Configuration like this below 1K is really tao chio already.
This set comes configured with 8GB single channel, I wonder what beast will it become with dual channels."

Because it will throttle
Any reason why wants to get 13” vs 15”? Vice versa
Posted with Audeze LCD-X HardwareZone Forums app"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lenovo doesn't have 13"" thinkpads. Closest is 12.5"" X series.
15""
Larger screen, lower ppi for same res
Heavier
Bulkier
Keyboard has Numpad
Generally cheaper for same specs
13/14""
Smaller screen, higher ppi for same res
Lighter
Smaller
Keyboard has no Numpad
Generally more expensive for same specs
Depends on preference lo. I generally prefer the 14"" coz the keyboard layout w/o numpad."
Lenovo Thinkpad,depends on ur needs but if got 12 or 13 i will get most portable one. if macbook pro i will get the biggest cos of the retina. this thinkpad screen not so good also. will mainly output to my 32 inch monitor if i get one.

Lenovo Thinkpad,How is the e485 vs the Acer Swift 3 from qoo10? 14 inch full HD 256gb and 8gb ram for 888. Core i5 8th gen. Seems like a good alternative at 1.45kg...
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I'm also looking at the same.
E485 vs Acer Swift 3
1.75kg vs 1.45kg
E485 is bulkier
Thinkpad non-backlit keyboard vs backlit chiclet keyboard
16gb RAM no brainer $10 upgrade vs 8gb ram non upgradeable
AMD Ryzen vs Intel i5
VEGA gfx vs no Intel integrated gfx
3 yr onsite warranty vs 2 year carry in
1x1 wifi vs 2x2 mu-mimo

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thinking of buying and replacing it, but will there be any benefit?
2x2 usually comes with 2 antennas, which are routed through the monitor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can order the parts from lenovo website or lazada.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"thats a very good point, anybody have any idea if it come with one or two antenna?
ahh, searching via model number yield better result. i was searching by ""m.2 wifi module"" and i cant find anything"
Lenovo Thinkpad,can find amazon?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thank you! nvr though of using amazon.
I'm actually looking recommendation of model for replacement and where to get them locally if possible. Realize that not all model works for lenovo.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Seems like not compatible if use SGNIGHT promo code?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Darn never use shopback... Can save close to $60.. why the button no flag
Lenovo Thinkpad,"There's no Shopback rebate if you use the promo codes. Tried, appealed and rejected."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Good enough for the asking price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Try AliExpress. Ordered the Intel 9260 for SG$25+, expected to arrive within 4 weeks. Will update if it is compatible."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Reviews for Intel 9260 seems to be bad.
Range problems in particular"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Online reviews are quite polarizing in their verdict.
Nevertheless, antenna design for each laptop model will play a big part as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I have my own 7260. Hopefully it will work

Point is, I was referring to the Ryzen ENVY and seems that the Ryzen Thinkpad may have similar issues"
Lenovo Thinkpad,What issue? Can sic?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"just curious but why only BSODs with Youtube ?
BSODs are usually either hardware issue or driver issues.
Not entirely sure how Youtube can cause BSODs playback via edge, chrome, firefox etc.
I am not doubting you, but more to i wish to understand more.
My Xiaomi laptop is experiencing some BSOD issues and it usually happens with YouTube hence my curiosity.

Lenovo Thinkpad,How come E485 more ex than E585? My specs same as yours and I have a 2700 processor. I dont recall paying over $1k for it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"He sell at $900 nett, sure got people interested to take it from him. Better than losing 15%. Just my 2 cents worth."
Lenovo Thinkpad,E585 suppose to be cheaper by 80-90 dollar. as always larger is always cheaper for laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,"lol as mentioned its BNIB price non negotiable. its for people who doesn't like to wait that long. Not looking to make profit here.
worst case scenario i will just open the box and use it myself next month."

Lenovo Thinkpad,yea. just worried about the screen. that's all.
Lenovo Thinkpad,the weight also CMI unless for home use.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all, for those who got the laptop already, can comment on the following:
- battery life in Windows for normal web surfing and office work
- any crashes or instability?
- performance in day to day usage
I am really on the verge of buying from the forumer who has a set ready tomorrow, but just hesitating on these few aspects. To me the e485 is perfect cos it has usb gen 2 and power delivery. Not to mention 16gb ram and 512gb ssd don't know where else to find
My other alternative is to login with my student account and buy the e480, but a similar spec one costs 500 more"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"thats why i no take 15"".
i took the 14"" <2KG. my previous notebook is 1.8KG. E485 is 1.75KG.. ok leh.
if you read my initial post, i was also shunned by the fact that it was 2.1KG until i saw an alternative. One of my criteria for a notebook it has to be below 1.8KG compared with my old book"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Acer is coming out with a 900gsm, 15.6 inch laptop if anyone going to light weight."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No crash and don't experience any problem so far, but cannot comment on battery as I don't really care about it. For the price, I think the compromises is good enough.
Future thinkpad will go along the line of XPS look. Hopefully, it will cost reasonably."
Lenovo Thinkpad,if it is gonna be everything soldered on..
Lenovo Thinkpad,I like classic thinkpad looks has distinct unique substance.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks. I decided to get it. To those wondering, I guess there is still value in getting at RRP if it can delivered immediately."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Technology is always improving. No rush to buy a
subpar
laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Good for you. The price is good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am using subpar E585 already. Everything has been installed and working well. I have good experience with Lenovo laptops and ThinkPad laptops.
I do recommended friends to buy Acer too."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Disappointed, my screen has 3 dead not bright pixels on it... 2 consecutive black dots on the right hand side and one on the top. Not sure if it's dead pixels or black dust under the screen"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Just warranty it lo.nbd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is it possible to carry in service?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Call/email them first. 3 pixels might not be enough to be covered under their dead pixel policy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,My laptop just came too. Battery totally flat. Thought usually have some power beforehand.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Do you guys think this is dead pixel or dust under the screen ah tried wiping off but no use?



First one is really annoying. Second and third not so bad. I see Lenovo's dead pixel policy for ThinkPad is 3 or more. You think got hope?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Tbh, looks like dust under the screen. If you take a photo and zoom in all the way until can see subpixel, will be able to tell diff is dead pixel = subpixels not lit, dust = subpixels covered by dust."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Sian. Hopefully can be covered under warranty. If not can I ask them to buy another screen for me? Lol. When bringing down to service centre, need to bring what ah? Also... how long will it take? Prefer going to service centre than on-site warranty
Other than that, the notebook  seems fine so far. No crashes on Youtube, which is good."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Agreed, the shape looks irregular, not a typical pixel shape."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Shouldn't be flat. They disabled the battery before shipping the product. Plug in the adaptor to reactivate the battery.
Mine behaved the same way too. Plugged in and got 80% immediately."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Will it be covered under warranty?
Scared they say it's normal"

Lenovo Thinkpad,The e485 is actually 1.86KG not 1.75KG. felt cheated. Morever i don't have the sata hdd already so heavy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"That's bad business sense on their part, to lie about their real laptop weight"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thankfully we all chose ryzen, cos nothing new on this side of the fence until next year.
Thunderbolt 3 and maybe an extra usb-c port aside, I think this laptop is quite future proof in that it supports usb c gen 2 and usb c charging. That's why I got it in the end. And since it's only 1k with 16gb ram and 512gb ssd, can resell it down the road I guess, when tb3 and usb3.1 gen 2 goes mainstream.
To be honest only after seeing the links you posted I decided to buy the laptop... CuZ the swift 5 you posted doesn't even seem to support usb 3.1 gen 2 and will only come out end of the year"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not too bad too. Plus the offer $100 off ram upgrade in Aug just expired. So now technically $100 more expensive for same specs.
Current 'Comex' offer is $100 off i7 upgrade."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Sept promo isnt better. I shall check other deals at comex or if black friday at lenovo us since intl warranty. No hurry to get a laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yep.. hope my screen comes back fine so I can finally use it.
Anyone knows if the Anker powercore is able to charge this laptop?"

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Don't know why the factory provides different parts as from the information or am I seeing it wrong? Below is the parts stated ""as built' from the website, it is stated as 2280 but on the motherboard it's so short in the post.
Smaller than 512MB SSD may be shorter length, because I have the 2280 size. 512MB, all in black with some emboss numbers only
Info from Lenovo's website:

Photo from Lenovo's website:"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Mine is quite fast leh. updated to the latest Windows and deleted the useless anti virus Lenovo SSD is surely slower than Samsung, but I don't think it's that slow and don't think we can feel it so much in real life. I don't know, but that's how I felt."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am a little bit tempted to sell the laptop off to get the Acer Swift 3 or HP Envy 13. This is after I realised the newer models have the capability to charge via USB-C, and also have a dedicated power supply so you don't waste away a USB-C port just like that.
However, right now, the Swift 3 and Envy 13 only have Type C Gen 1 and not Gen 2 like the E485. Also, speccing it to have a 512GB RAM on either models will be far more expensive. So a little on the fence. Battery life and weight may pull me over the edge.
One thing about weight though. My office laptop, until recently, was a T440, an Ultrabook. I really loved the laptop, thought it was really light until I got my Latitude 7390 replacement which was even lighter and wished I could have a similar one for home use. Guess what? The T440 weights 1.81kg. Pretty much the same as the E485."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My experience with this laptop is good after setup complete.
The drivers are quite raw in terms of support only lenovo has the latest version
After drivers installed no BSOD nonsense not even on youtube chromium
it can do up to 4K on youtube just running pure on CPU raw power.
Chose win10 home version ""modded"" to win10 pro version
after optimization super duper fast I did a clean install
disable CSM boot, option rom etc and the boot message"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"China, really is china. Tons of variations. I have updated everything to the latest including drivers. And removed everything that i deem unnecessary including AV. It is not Windows that i am blaming. It is Bios/cmos.
In fact the read write is only comparable to a SATA SSD. Except for big files on read. The write is either worst or similar to a Samsung EVo 850 that i owns. Iirc with my cdm benchmark."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can't expect too much for a 1k laptop tbh.
Even the asus ux331 that costs 2k+ uses only a sata ssd.
Don't really need nvme speeds unless read/write huge files often anw, makes no observable diff in everyday use."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yup for the price... 16gb and 512gb is unheard of.
Anyone did further tests on battery life? I think should be able to last 7 hours leh. Once all the proper drivers and all are installed.
Main negative about this laptop is that the firmware and bios is a bit buggy at the moment. Hopefully these will be ironed out over time"

To me, 4hrs+ was decent enough"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I see. Think 5 hours is still ok. Anyone tried the Anker powercore to charge this laptop yet?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can this be the RAM problem? I remember to wanted to pair yours with another old RAM you had.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Definitely not because the ram was removed from a functioning notebook
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Maybe try removing it and try again?
Might be compatability issue since both sticks might have different speeds and frequency.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Oh ok. Different expectations then
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is the antenna easy to remove? How to take it on and off ah? Thinking of upgrading to intel 2x2
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Very simple.
Also CPU is BGA soldered to motherboard.
Repasted the CPU using Shin Etsu idle temperatures drop around 5 degrees."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"That is not due to performance but OEM BIOS design.
Lenovo BIOS does not prioritize POST speeds.
I know Toshiba BIOS tune POST speed heavily even before everyone switch to UEFI."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"HSF easy to remove? 5c drop sounds good, might try to re-paste as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Simple means how ah? Just renove, no need turn any screws?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"After remove backplate can access everything.
4 screw to remove HSF
original paste job

Easily one of the easiest laptop to disassemble."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not true... ThinkPads have very short BIOS times.. even those with Optimus are going at 4 second BIOS time around 2011-2012 time frame.
The Intel Phoenix BIOSes ThinkPads heavily optimised for boot times. No idea on the Ryzen side if they're on Insyde, award, ami, phoenix or what BIOS vendor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"4 seconds is considered slow.
Toshibas won't even let you hit a Key to enter bios. They have a special button to interrupt POST or use Windows Boot to UEFI.
E485 is using Phoenix BIOS
Consumer grade Ideapads boot fast though, they have a boot to BIOS button as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,If it's an optimus / enduro laptop with an additional dGPU UEFI GOP module it won't outrun an iGPU machine in post time.

any other feedback about this laptop?

Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am just a casual user on windows, with most of my work done on my MBP.
For basic usage, the E585 isnt any faster than my old Asus Zenbook UX305 which I got free from Starhub. I assumed the Asus Zenbook is just supposed to be light and look sleek and chio, compromising on performance while the E585 is supposed to be a work-horse. Thus I am a little disappointed. Somehow the start-up seems slower than the Zenbook too.
My main issue is with the battery life. Previously I reported that battery went down about 50% with just an hour of usage. I have since followed the advice of brothers here, uninstalled McAfee, installed Vantage and the Lenovo power management apps. The battery life doesnt seem to have much improvements. I am projecting a battery life of 2.5 hours at best. Is it because the E585 consumes more power than the E485?"

The keyboard right now has the issue of jumbled keystrokes, hope it is resolved soon.
Battery life like not so good... still monitoring. Currenty I just upgraded from 17.09 to 18.03, wonder if it solves things. I think idle battery drain on Ryzen is surprisingly bad. Using FF also seems to increase battery drain."

Otherwise, there will be a 1.28 bios coming out next week that will fix it.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Can see this thread. There is a beta 1.28 bios already that a few people have but now officially we are told to wait for the official release next week
Lenovo Thinkpad,"no wonder they offer to refund me in full but then it sets me thinking, how soon can i recover my money so that i can go get another 1 or should i get another 1 first - but later if they say have fix don't 1 return me then i will have 2 notebooks?
anyway noway we can have a copy of the beta bios copy? I am alittle skeptical about waiting till next week probably they will keep delaying"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Since they agree to refund you already, maybe you try flashing back to 1.25 first? I tried asking those who managed to get the beta but all refused to share"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Bios 1.32 was just released. U can see if it fixes it? Changelog doesn't mention anything tho
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ok will try it over the wkend.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"ok. 1.32 fixes everything. thanks
Fast boot and fix on keyboard"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Installed 1.32 on mine too. Not sure if placebo, but battery consumption seems to have improved a bit.
Sadly, after I got the screen changed, my new screen has backlight bleeding issues. Seems to be pressure related cos when I press around the bleeding area it goes away... It's only apparent at high brightness, but seeing it every time during boot where max brightness is activated is annoying.. haha
Am still thinking if I shld change to spin 5 instead. Cos now going for 1198 only and has active stylus. 512gb but 8gb ram. Battery life seems better and has windows hello fingerprint reader though. Slightly lighter as well and supports usb type c charging in addition to power adaptor. But dunno about the 'lengendary' Acer build quality"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"On new laptop with extremely thin bezel disassembly is tricky business due to the thin joints etc.
That is why I almost never touch the monitor assembly"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If it's pressure related, try the credit card method?
Sent from Samsung SM-G955F using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,A bit scared to do on my own... Hahaha. Maybe I go service centre see if there is any easy fix. If not sua already
Lenovo Thinkpad,"So 1.32 bios fixed everything?
Any major issues standing?
Was thinking of getting."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"none for me. Battery life a bit on the short side, laptop a bit heavy and screen quality not so good, but for an office or casual laptop it will do. Right now the drivers for graphics are very outdated so might want to consider other options if gaming"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Suspend resume clock stuck at 1.4GHz
Sometimes boot up also affected"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ryzen 7 2700U goes up to 80 degrees during stress test
How much Ryzen 5 2500U reach?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,any other good notebooks you could recommend at similar price point?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Don't have.
Everything else is either more expensive, or weaker in specs, or very similar but intel/less enterprise in specs
To understand laptop market just grab pricing list of Acer,HP, Lenovo,ASUS, Dell and compare price group then their specs.
I assure you this one is one of the cheapest with highest specs already"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Was looking at Acer Spin 5, 512gb but 8gb ram. Going for 1198 now. Going to comex later to see if there are better pricing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"if good specs but many taiji also no use right...
sometime is ""good enough"" can liao..
nothing is cheap and good de...."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Spin 5 is nice but cant upgrade ram
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am hopeful lenovo will fix it.
Currently it is quite usuable for me
Besides the stupid bugs, a few reason I like it
Easy to dissemble
Enterprisy features
Nice HID devices
Good specs
Low price
Support NVM SSD
Easy to access bios chip for offline flashing
USB C Charging"
Lenovo Thinkpad,No choice lor. The techanic is selling hp envy13 on Carousell with 16gb and 512gb for 1351. But need to preorder
Lenovo Thinkpad,"overpried imo. I have to say, HP Envy looks awesome though."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"BIOS 1.32 is out.
powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Means what?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If anyone interested, I have decided to sell my e485. If anyone is interested just let me know. 16gb 512gb Samsung SSD"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Getting spin???
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ideapad 720s. Long battery and thunderbolt 3. 1.5k is the going price which I think is reasonable. Other options all restricted to usb 3 gen 1
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Spin no USB type C quick charging
Sent from Xiaomi MI MAX using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Probably use it as side laptop..
Thanks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I see.. thanks.. don't think will suspend and resume for me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,1.5k. that's a huge leap.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yeah it is. But I weigh the pros and cons. It has thunderbolt so don't need to worry about whiskey lake and all coming out. So quite future proof ba. And probably no need wait for drivers lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Pretty good price at 1385 on the online store. Too bad no 16gb ram option tho =
EDIT: Apparently only single-channel ram too. Performance is gonna be limited. PWM screen too."
Lenovo Thinkpad,After repasting max temperature is 76 degrees with CPUZ stress test
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Bought the intel version, so single channel ram not so bad. Not using for gaming anyway.
Was quoted lowest 1508 at comex. But I went to best Denki and managed to bargain down to 1449. Some people complain that this laptop has a nosiy fan. But I find it still ok"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Been using my E585 for about a week, so far did not experience any of the issue mentioned in this thread. I bought this laptop knowing that a 45W battery driving a IPS FHD screen would not last for long so battery life to me is ok.
1 battery last me around 4hrs of normal usage such as youtube, browser and songs running in the background without gaming.
2 I'm lucky to have receive Samsung SSD from pushing the power button to window login too me around 5~8s.
3 i don't have any issue with my screen.
4 Purchased a 2tb HDD and installed in my laptop without any issue.
5 WiFi run quite smoothly, don't know if there is any advantage from getting a 2x2 M.2 Wifi card to replace the existing card.
So far that's what i could think of. Kinda inspired by some of the post above to do some repasting but getting a 3g tube of thermal paste is such a waste i feel. Any thermal paste to recommend?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"saw Qoo10 cheaper with the coupons, credit card and gc thrown in.
doubt will get it due to soldered on sodimm slot however.
330s however, seems more interesting. Optane memory, 1 sodimm slot however."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I have no issue with ThinkPad E585 after using it for sometime, with updated power management firmware and the latest BIOS. The system boot into Windows less than 5 secs and less than that when set to sleep, due to the SSD drive.
My power settings are set to maximum power saving with 50 -60% screen brightness, running YouTube, web browsing, web apps, Google Office and Microsoft Office. I always have power point available so I did not take note or care about battery life.
My specs was Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM and 512 SSD, added another Samsung Evo 860 500 SSD myself and the cost less than 1.2k is still less than HP, Ideapad or any other brands available on the market currently by at least 200 dollars or more. These more expensive ones have less than the specs of my ThinkPad."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Think the version listed is the dual core 7th gen processor one.
Anyway 720s is about to EOL so very cheap.
But I agree, specs wise, if don't care about battery and bugs and the screen, the e485 and e585 are super value for money. But for me I already have a desktop pc. So I value portability and battery life more."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ideapad 720s review
Lenovo Thinkpad,"indeed. my e485 already have marks although i don't have sweaty palms. value for money in terms of specs, yes.. material and etc... questionable.
really love the 16-32GB with 2 SODIMM slots + NVME and SATA SSD expansion."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I wasnt too happy with my battery life. I am only expecting about 3 hours. Not sure if I should flag it as a problem.
Startup time is also slower than expected. My old Zenbook boots faster.
No dead pixels. But are the edges of the screen display supposed to curve in slightly, like a piece of paper, especially at the corners?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"even my old dell boots faster considering that it is on SATA SSD only.
Nope, it shouldn't mine doesn't have the display issue u mentioned."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"mine didn't. But the display lid is really flimsy. Apply a bit of pressure and you can see the whole display change colour.
Fingerprints--i guess that's because of the soft touch plastic used. But the palm rest area should get less because it uses those normal hard plastic.
In the end I sold it cos of battery life and portability. If portability is ok you guys may want to try getting education price and opting for the e480 or l480. Get the cheapest option for full hd and then upgrade the rest of the parts yourself."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Did the new BIOS update have this?
Or you guys all using windows..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You get what you pay for, honestly.
The ThinkPad enthusiast communities don't generally consider the E series true ThinkPads. They aren't constructed in the way the higher tier ThinkPads are even the L series, which is also fully plastic. Like all ThinkPads they are designed with some enterprise-class features the ThinkPad firmware, including battery controls, vPro on the Intel models, etc, ease of maintenance, upgradability, and the decent keyboard and TrackPoint, but the E series compromises on the overall build quality.
Compare the screen hinge between the L480 which has the same double-hinge design as the T/X/A/etc series and E480:
Spoiler!
The E480 has the same single-hinge design as standard consumer laptops.
Someone once said the E series are just IdeaPads dressed in a suit. Which is kind of true, although the current Ex80 series is significantly better than older models the E480 even has MIL-STD-810G certification, although the E485 doesn't, I suppose to save cost, but it has the same construction so you can just treat it as if it does. In any case you still get the ThinkPad warranty, and especially for the current models it is still better than most consumer laptops out there.
The A485 should be releasing soon in Singapore it's already available on some other regions' web stores. It seems like it'll cost maybe $200 more than the E485 for an equivalent spec, but for a much better chassis and also expandable external battery!. If you care about that, but you still don't want to pay the Intel tax, then maybe it is worth waiting for. Otherwise you can just get the T480s.
This has not been true for a few years now. Linux driver support, at least on those Linux-certified ThinkPads, is generally excellent. Device power management is now on par with Windows.
Because of that, on my albeit Intel laptop Windows 10 has never given me better battery life than Linux, simply because of all the things running in the background on W10.
This is only for the X1C6, which prior to the recent update did not expose the S3 state in its DSDT only S0i3, causing high sleep power drain in Linux.
No other ThinkPad does that. Linux should be able to go into S3 sleep without an issue on the E{4,5}85. In fact the S0ix states are an Intel thing, so these AMD computers will never have that issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think e480 has a different construction than the e485/e585.
A few factors Mil-spec, lack of backlit keyboard compatibility, etc. point to the e485/585 sharing the same construction as the older models e475/e470 instead.
e480 build quality was improved, though it is still nowhere near the other more premium series.
Also, I doubt A485 would be just $200 more if it was, that would be incredible value for money!.
UK pricing puts the starting price at 240 pounds more than the e485.
Price difference is likely to be around $500."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"It's 1/3 more than the A485. You guys sure KPKB de.
TN  no IPS  some more"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"IPS option will come in around 2-3weeks.
for similarly specs A285 likely around 800-1000HKD more.
so it is likely the following for 2500U, difference in 2x2wifi and weight.
E485 8gb 256gb 1080p  SGD867
A485 8gb 256GB 1080p SGD1090 before shipping+taxes
E285 8gb 256GB 1080p SGD1260 before shipping+taxes"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Nope the e485 and e480 same service manual
Board PCB layout also similar"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Likely same case material as well. The case interior was stamped with ""E480"" when I opened my E485 up."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Icic. That's good to hear.
Wonder why the e485 doesn't support backlit kb then
Also, just received my e485. samsung ssd =D"
Lenovo Thinkpad,The palm rest area is rough on the e485 Vs smooth touch on the e480. So there's some difference in some of the materials at least
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just got this laptop last week. I got BSOD while watching Youtube. Happened a few times already.
The error is VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE ATIKMPAG.SYS. I tried to download the graphics drivers from lenovo website but it says the driver is already the latest. Any idea how to solve this problem?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"E585 seems to be problem free. Heng, but those who want good and light quality should get the X series or want good quality get the T series.
I get this mainly for the specs over price."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeah mine is pointing to gpu drivers issues as well. Lazy to troubleshoot, waiting for them to collect it back
Latest drivers too
I have to say, love the specs and the ability to upgrade almost everything is a gem. Plus the price.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i guess AMD ryzen mobilechip has yet to be optimized by laptop manufacturers.  As a die hard AMD fan, i'm sad to see the state of their mobile chip.
I guess, we got to wait for the next iteration. ryzen 2500u is like the best of both worlds, quad core 8 threads + onboard gpu with high performance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For those who have issues, can try this driver."
Lenovo Thinkpad,This laptop seems buggy. Sigh my hunt for a Linux laptop continues
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ryzen A485 is available on Malaysias website. It is built on T480?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Nah, E480 and E485 share the same casing. Just search for the C cover assembly
FRU P/N 01LW157. Notice that the E480 and E485 are listed as compatible:

I also realised today that the E480/E485, L480 and T480s all share the same keyboard FRU P/N 01YP280 etc. That's pretty amazing, you're getting the same typing experience as on one of their flagship laptops T480s. That shows how much they've improved the E series too..
And you could probably
, or buy one straight from Lenovo, and just install it if you wanted. The listings above aren't the cheapest you could get, a lot of sellers don't list the FRU P/Ns.
I think they should be of similar build, but they're not totally identical.
Honestly I'm not sure why Lenovo doesn't just combine the A series into the T/X like they've done with the E."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Nah, the backlight for the backlit keyboards doesn't work with the E485."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Could be something to do with the firmware or the motherboard I guess.
But otherwise the construction is identical.
... The funny thing is that Lenovo themselves list the backlit keyboards as being compatible with the E485."
Lenovo Thinkpad,so are you returning it??
Lenovo Thinkpad,"probably it's like kickstarter std, not ready for prime time babey"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Returned. They already processed it before the fix is out so i have no say any longer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,what's your next lappy? Starbucks de?
Lenovo Thinkpad,What's starbucks?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Seriously hwzers $800 already a bargain still want this want that.
A little bit of bug unless you die die must baremetal linux cannot virtualise also cannot wait for BIOS Updates...
Next time should keep quiet about good deals and let them pay more and feel better..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE ATIKMPAG.SYS
Indicates hardware problem. So returning is the best option"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I got this error before, clean install never seen it after.
This is just video not responding in a timely manner.
Basic troubleshooting techniques, clean install and try again check if repeatable.
Unless you tell me you are rich man cannot afford to spend some time troubleshooting then you shouldn't look at this laptop in the first place just get the most expensive one in the first place.
I also happen to got e475 before this unit. Some issues with the driver not until this September then can do reliable VP9 2K on Youtube.
AMD is slow on drivers, wait for it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I repasted this laptop over 4 times to get a feel of it.
This laptop is really so easy to dissemble, I feel I can do it anytime without much effort.
Now I can be sure the lowest it can go during idle is 47,48 degrees."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I don't know whats your problem. You can doesn't mean others can. To you $800 might be little but not necessarily be alot to others.
If you have nothing better to say, just stfu la.
If i could predict the future, i would not have done the refund. Dude."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Used i5 X260 can also dig for T460 from company asset disposal is around $500-600 sometimes still with some warranty. Some with WWAN antennas built in, some without. SIM tray is part of the motherboard assembly.
On 48WH/r battery it's about real 8-10 hours battery life though dual core. If you won the lottery you may get 24+48WH/r, IPS than TN panel for that price. If you power optimise it on battery mode sub 1.5ghz, it's just sub 2.5W CPU package power light/moderate use, full machine 100+ nits, low power consumption AC8260. On the 96WH/r config it's around 19Hrs on those type of settings. Windows 10 modern shutdown/start from power button to desktop ~10 sec.
If you just need many hours of moderate or light use unplugged its a good machine.
No botched firmwares, normally just security fixes. Not a sexy machine, GPU just for multimedia. AMD firmwares/drivers lack validation for ThinkPad usage. The TTM is late and they have yet to ship a production driver for MUXless graphics switching Optimus which kills their share of the dGPU notebook market for vega mobile."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Then buy other laptops in the first place.
This is a good value for money machine.
Not the fastest laptop in the market machine."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Optimus because Intel and Nvidia are different company.
AMD owns both the CPU and GPU, different approach.
And I am using this for Virtualisation."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"And that's the reason why i buy it. The problem I thought it only affects me so i invoke support to come over, they can't fix either and told me they will perform a refund. I never even ask for it.
Since i need a working notebook immediately because I tried to type notes on it and all i got was messed up notes that i couldn't even understand what I typed.
I don't even know it is a small issue when I can't even type properly and also need a working laptop urgently.
Btw, just to add on - when the bios is out, i managed to get it sorted out but lenovo already processed with the refund."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Conceptually, Enduro PX5.0 and Optimus are the equivalents. Muxless graphics switching. ""Switchable graphics"" was muxed graphics switching.
They've had some sort of PX4.0/5.0 hybrid on AMD/AMD systems. But it's pretty mind boggling how they aren't working with nVidia to get those dGPUs on their notebooks. Quite frankly the pcie compression through limited laptop pcie lanes on the ati driver stack is quite bad. There were already telltale signs around 2012-2013 time frame when I was still touching the aboriginal eGPU that were taking PCIe from expresscards and WiFi slots when on kepler vs gcn. Back then, something like a GTX 660 still scaled quite well when put through optimus relative to something that's pitcairn level taking a larger haircut thanks to enduro. Point being more raw hardware/power consumption for the equivalent performance.
The radeon mobility drivers still need a lot of work even to date. I've thought of Raven Ridge notebooks at some point but settled with a used X260 for now. Can't wait for BIOSes, drivers and workarounds though more raw hardware is nice."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Already shown which gpu driver to use to resolve the crash. So now is user problem?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Curious, what laptop u getting in the end?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"User complain still understandable.
What I can't understand is why some ppl don't even own the laptop yet can keep having so much complaint...
Sent from Samsung SM-G955F using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Acer swift 3.
Everything similar except only 1 dimm slot that is upgradable. The other 4GB ram is onboard, total 12GB.
Comes with fingerprint, windows hello, kb backlite, lighter by 400grams but $200 more expensive, less 4GB ram, 2 year carry in warranty.
No matter how i see it, the E485 is still a champ in terms of value."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I see. Should wait for qoo10 coupons again. Then it may be even cheaper than e485 now with no more 16gb promo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,U getting another one? How many notebooks are you changing?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No, sticking with the IdeaPad 720s for the foreeseeable future. Battery life is twice that of the ThinkPad and weight almost half.
I have to say, the ThinkPad keyboard is better and seems built like a tank. Maybe will consider again next year when all the bugs are sorted out.
Meanwhile, I think no point waiting for something that may never materialise."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Interesting. Great purchase!
I wanted the 330s actually.. but ended up with the Acer instead.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not really a user problem. Issue persists with the APU drivers provided by Lenovo, which incidentally dates back to 2017 version 17.7 with no further updates. To get the latest drivers from AMD, which are not officially sanctioned, you have to side-load, since the driver packages provided by AMD are not supported by Raven Ridge."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am using the driver provided by lenovo, i think the BSOD results from image preparation process with the drivers"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"As long as it resolve the issue, does it really matters who provide the drivers?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Any good docking station to recommend for this laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,this model does not support.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Docking station only why no support? Even E480 and E580 can use USB-C docking station.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I bought a samsung 860 evo 500gb m2 ssd
Now this ssd is not detected in bios or ssd on my e585
Updated to latest bios but still same issue
Please help"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You CANNOT put in a SATA SSD into a NVMe SSD slot.
1 connects via a SATA Controller the other attaches to PCI-E Bus"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for the reply
I think i have to sell this off"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Buy a converter to SATA pin out if you want to save money
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for the suggestion
Looks like the cheapest Samsung 512GB NVME is $328
I might get the adapter and convert it to sata
or sell this one and get a 1 tb ssd drive"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone tested E485 max battery life in hours?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Approximately 4-5hrs. Lesser if full brightness.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I wonder is it the ryzen cpu is not power saving or thinkpad internal battery pack not sufficient.
Looking for around 10hr batt life"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ryzen CPU bah. Cos on brief web surfing it maintains around 10k to 12k mah usage. For Intel it can go down to 7 to 9k or 4k when idle Ryzen idle is about 7-8k. Peak wise I think Ryzen is more efficient tho
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If 4-5hr is an accurate estimate, then the average power consumption is like 9-11W for the 45WH/r battery.
You can interpolate with the commonly used mobilemark 2014 runtime for lenovo across their notebooks to have a good guess on the ""real"" battery life of other thinkpads. But mobilemark iirc does not account for active wifi radio usage meaning no weightage/measurement of wifi card power consumption"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"To update, received a replacement card from the seller and faced the same issue. So it is not a problem with the physical hardware.
Did another night of troubleshooting all for a $20 card! - Noticed that issue with slow upload speeds only cropped up when I installed updated Realtek
LAN
drivers for my E485 either via Lenovo Vantage, or manual installation.
The 9260 worked perfectly fine, with the default Realtek LAN drivers that came with a fresh install of Windows 10 not from Recovery.
Not sure where the link was though. Probably going put up for sale the 2 9260 cards I have"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I also bought a 9260 works fine without the intense troubleshooting of course
I _NEVER_ install disVantage"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I volunteer to absorb 1 of the AC9260 for a spare AC8260 I cover both ways postage
Lenovo Thinkpad,Interesting. Can you help check the version of your Realtek LAN drivers?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Really depend on usage, if you want that long than iPad.
Even surface pro up to 5 hours but again depend on usage.
Unless you get a second battery or higher end business model
like T480 with option for 6 cell 72wh battery.
But again if usage too intensive the battery time will decrease."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"for e585, the rams are single channel or dual channel? do i need to change them to dual?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Should be default win driver never bothered to update generic stuff like realtek nic.
But got the driver for 9260 from intel"
Lenovo Thinkpad,You mean Single/Dual Channel or Rank
Lenovo Thinkpad,single/dual channel
Lenovo Thinkpad,Once you have 2 slots full should be dual channel
Lenovo Thinkpad,Interesting. My IdeaPad 720s that I bought after selling away the e485 had the same issue. Also Intel 9260 or 9265 can't remember. 300mbps download and 30mbps upload. But after I updated drivers on Windows update I'm getting 400+ each direction
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The lowest I ever got on the Ryzen when leaving everything off except WiFi and not doing anything was about 7W. There's something 'wrong' with idle power consumption. Not sure what is consuming all the power.
Anyway, Carousell is selling the Aukey 30k power delivery power bank for just 69 dollars. Should be able to double battery life"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can help check the versions of both the 9260 and Realtek LAN drivers? Glad to know I'm not the only one with these issues haha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wary of Intel compatibility already
Lenovo Thinkpad,does changing thermal paste for hsf help? i have spare arctic silver mx4. read on reddit some say lenovo did good job on paste so change also no diff
Lenovo Thinkpad,Tried the Qualcomm 61x4a?
Lenovo Thinkpad,what is the ram speed for this model? any noticeable diff if i get a faster pair
Lenovo Thinkpad,Should be Max 2400 cos is first gen ryzen
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I have 2 units of lenovo e475 and e485.
Both are slapped on and pressed down.
The e475 used a phase change paste like shin etsu while the e485 use a wetter type like dow corning.
I think arctic silver is a joke thermal paste.
I repasted with Shin Etsu dry phase change thermal paste for both"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Where to get this shin etsu thermal paste?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Laptop sinks are normally low mounting pressure. You don't add low viscosity pastes to low mounting pressure sinks. Unless you don't mind more paste replacement cycles.
Lenovo Thinkpad,The paste they use can differ even though it is lenovo. usually dow corning or shin etsu
Lenovo Thinkpad,On my table
Lenovo Thinkpad,"But both are ok and the amount of paste preapplied on the sink that's pressed down, mx4 texture is too watery for laptop sink."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"so for this laptop, does reapplying new thermal paste help? what paste should i get"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ask the actual owners. Just thinkpad user ssrr based on how it typically appears when preapplied on fans in cru form.
Something with moderate viscosity works. Just strike off :
-mx4 newer formula also watery
-kryonaut very watery before steady state or anything similar in texture"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya this is the LAN driver with no issues. Attempting to update this driver will screw up the 9260 upload speeds.
I cannot fathom how LAN drivers will affect WiFi."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Same problem. It worked for you?
For me, the problem only disappears with the generic MS drivers for Realtek LAN 9.1.406.2015."
Lenovo Thinkpad,so it means to uninstall the driver and reinstall from lenovo web site?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can also try A285 Display Drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"A285 and A485 are available in the Lenovo Singapore store now.
The price difference to E485 for an equivalent-specced model is about $100 only!!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,wasted no 16GB $1 upgrade.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Review is out and it is disappointing.

Cheap yes so there are pros and cons."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, I saw that review. They didn't test it with dual-channel memory, which actually impacts Ryzen pretty significantly. Other than that, discounting the performance differences due to AMD instead of Intel AMD's parts are still not as power efficient as Intel, let's face it, and the same firmware keyboard and ACPI IVRS table issues as the E485, it's pretty much identical to the T480.
It is not going to be worse than the E485, so for an extra $100-$200 you get a better construction dual hinge instead of mono, CFRP instead of PC/ABS on some parts, the external hotswappable battery, and an overall slightly slimmer and lighter body.
I'm waiting for Notebookcheck's E485 review."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"When gen 2 come?
Posted with Audeze LCD-X HardwareZone Forums app"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"A285 vs A485
Which one has a better battery life?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,somebody feedback that a485 is worse tham e485. single heatpipe compared to e485 dual heat pipe. plus the screen uses pwm
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Take note A is using pro version of the chip, e is using the consumer
version.
Difference between pro and normal is lack of build in security
feature."
Lenovo Thinkpad,all LCD uses PWM right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lenovo just updated the VGA drivers on  1st October
Tested high GPU Load/ Low CPU Load on youtube VP9 4K"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not so soon maybe mid next year or so.
For the time being, Ryzen laptop are just a new tech
so down the road it will sure get better and better.
FYI these Thinkpads are using Ryzen U series NB chip.
H series are out but have yet to see them in any
laptop.
H series are high performance but rated at 45 watt
not like U series at 15 watt."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not sure if they can 45w , being 15w also got ""issue"" liao.
As in, they need to look on the design not just jigsaw puzzle NB from the air"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Some manufacturer recycle NB design based on Intel port
to AMD which doesn't work."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Of course not.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"For those who has bought the E585,
Can you share how is it, pros and con for it ?
Thanks,
archonmage"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"would this laptop be adequate to run R, Python and Tableau?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Cons:
- Screen is not as good  sRGB, Adobe RGB and brightness
- Software got some quirks they have emailed 2 updates which I have not applied yet
Pros:
- Very good keyboard same as my 3k laptop
- Windows precision touch pad
- Charges very fast
- Speedy
- Not noisy
- Build quality though not as good as the better ThinkPad
- Very easy to upgrade/change components
Taking into consideration its price, it's a good buy definitely. If you want better, just pay more for other series or brands."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can, why not? The track ball will helps if you can get used to it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for the review ^_^
Can I know what are your configurations?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ryzen 7, veges 10, 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM, FHD screen, 65w charger, something like that. Lowest price for this specs on market already but with decent built quality."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Cons heavy la, if use at home ok la
Posted with Audeze LCD-X HardwareZone Forums app"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Heavy? I was considering it...
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wow, that are some serious configurations.
Getting a basic one since it is for my kids,
Ryzen 5, 8GB Ram, FHD screen, 45w charger, 1 Tera Hdd,
All in, $690.
With the 3 year warranty thrown in, it is a good buy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Up the SSD la bro~~~~
Lenovo Thinkpad,"2.1kg for E585, and 1.75kg for E485, which is slightly heavier than most non-gaming laptops.
To put into context, Macbook pro is 1.83kg."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The weight is not accurate for e485.
Mine comes without hdd and only a single ram already >1.8kg.
Potential buyers u might want to include this into your consideration"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Its not 690... 735?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Have to pay more to get better and lighter laptop, or get HP version of Ryzen. Maybe that's the trade-off or else those light laptop will have no USP."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Order after 10pm.
Choose the Ryzen 3 2200U and customize accordingly.
It will be 690."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for the advice.
I have consider it too. But finally decided on the hdd"
Lenovo Thinkpad,HDD will be slow and will get slower as time goes by. I don't know why it's happening on Windows whereas on the Mac and linux it does not seems to have this problem.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Why didn't you opt for the 65w charger?
It's just +$2."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can use 2 ecoupons?
Lenovo Thinkpad,It is +$16
Lenovo Thinkpad,I doubt so
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Then how to get $690...  I already applied the AMD18 coupon, how to apply SGNIGHT coupon?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Place your order after 10pm and you can use the SGNIGHT coupoon
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It shows as +$16 but its actually only +$2.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Yup. Thanks ^_^
Lenovo Thinkpad,Understand that the battery is non-removable.  Did anyone try to remove it and power up the laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Why would you want to do that?
If battery lifespan is a concern, you can opt to limit the percentage of full charge via Lenovo Vantage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ok. Will explore that option. Thanks ^_^
Lenovo Thinkpad,Better spend 16 dollars to get fast charging. 45w no fast charging de.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Should still have gone for a larger ssd tho. Read and write will slow down when the ssd approaches capacity, which will really slow down the laptop alot.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Use firefox with flash plugin and update driver from AMD.
The Radeon R5 should have HEVC decoding to do FHD
On google chrome with R5 at most FHD depending on CPU performance.
Below is R5 with firefox with flash plugin on FHD

If you want h264 in youtube chrome you have to install
to force youtube to use H264 decoding"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My existing is a Acer Amd A4-5000, 4 GB ram.
Watching youtube is no problem.
As for applications, it is a bit slow though.
If you want, you can cancel your order and reorder again.
128 Gb for SSD is kind of small. Either you up it to 256 Gb or top it up with a 500 Gb hdd.  Bear in mind that the SDD will die faster than the hdd.
In my desktop which uses SSD, the OS just pop up the warning a few days back that the SSD has error. Upon using a SSD analysis tool, indeed, going to die soon."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Agreed. More RAM is essential for all types of work, be it simple or complex.  However, cost is always a factor if budget is tight."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"There is a new AMD graphics driver.
At least better than old driver."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The thing is he wants to watch Full HD video on youtube and youtube forces chrome to use VP9 by default
Only the new Vega supports VP9 decoding.
Older GPUs has to manually force h264 on chrome browsers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Something new to me,
Tested on the 4k youtube in 1080 HD, no issue.
Tested on the 8k youtube in 720 HDp60, no issue.
However, 8k in 1080 HDp60, it is lagging.
The question is, all the above, using H264? I am using firefox browser"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Task manager Video Decode shows everything.
Install chrome
Go to youtube
You see utilization in Video Decode when youtube is running then it is using Hardware Decoding.
If your GPU support VP9 then it will work without you needing to install any plugin
If your GPU does not support VP9 and the CPU is weak then it will crawl when this happens install h264ify then restart chrome and try again.
If your CPU is strong you will see high cpu utilization as the CPU tries to decode VP9 in software
If you see your youtube run and lag repeatedly it is due to either network congestion or video decode congestion."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"From this experience, it seems that Chrome browser is better at handling Video decoding. GPU utilization never goes above 30%."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I got a few 500gb old HD. Anyway seem thinkpad is easy to diy. Maybe I just pop in 500gb.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Better than the official Lenovo one that is recently updated?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Different updates entirely
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The current 1 still sucks, BSOD occasionally.
I am forcing the Vega 10 driver for A285 on e485"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"When selecting for tyhe E585, if i choose no HDD, then how they give me the OS since i cant unselect it?
*EDIT: turns out it will auto change to 128gb ssd. In that case, might as well take 256gb ssd. Is there space for additional sata 2.5"" for hdd?
Also, for ram, i noticed the default is 4gb, if i change to 8gb or 4+4gb, it will -$40. All are running at 2400mhz. Like that i select 8gb at -$40 is better?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"There is additional space to add on a 2.5"" drive, if you don't select it. Ssd wise, 512gb is quite worthwhile if you can get a samsung nvme lottery. 256gb mostly will be lenovo brand.
For ram, do get dual channel since ryzen is highly dependent on ram. Most of us went for 16gb when the promo was $100 off ram upgrade aka +$10 to upgrade to 16gb ram, which is no brainer. You can get 8gb and add on another 8gb stick also.
Also recommend to get an ac9260 off taobao to upgrade from the 1x1 wifi. $20 only.

Wonder if it happens the same to e585"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ram promo is currently in effect?
Select the ryzen 3 version if it doesn't show up.
Looks like the promo is applied to 8gb as well, so 16gb is the same cost price but the upgrade costs +110.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for confirming, tried all options but cant get the +$20 for 8+8gb for now.
Seems like its not for AMD laptops as i saw the ram upgrade promo is for other higher end models.
Anyway, this shld be good for basic usage like youtube, internet and office?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ryzen 5 vs 7 not much difference only slight clock speed diff
Only ryzen 3 has no hyper threading
This spec already can fight with Intel i5/7 more than basic usage"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Minor diff from Ryzen 5 to 7.
Ryzen 5 is a better buy, in my opinion."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The $100 off ram is in effect by customizing from Ryzen 3 onwards.  It cost $60 to upgrade from 4 Gb to 8 Gb  in Sep.
I ordered near end Sep and cancel the order due to the better promo. Now it rebate you $40 for the upgrade instead."

On Site warranty means the technician will go to your house and diagnose or fix the laptop. If cant be fixed on the spot, he may bring back to service centre. But you will need to check if they will send back to your house under their costs or you go self collect."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Carry in, means your being to their service center. On site means they collect from your location."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My E485 simple review.
Pros:
Battery life not bad. 4 hrs or so, and charge really fast using the 65w charger. Full charge from 10%,1 Hr.
Build quality solid, metal lid and sturdy plastic no creeks when holding it.
Boot up really fast with SSD with the potential to upgrade further 500GB SSD HD maybe. And very usable even in max battery mode for youtube and document processing.
Liked the tactile feel of the keyboard, nice sized trackpad.
12GB ram, usually 40% used. Installed office 2016. Speakers not too bad for a sub $800 laptop.
Cons:
Lcd got light bleeding at the side when booting up with the Lenovo logo. Normal usage don't feel anything.
Conclusion
I am happy with the laptop, considering its price. Best bang for the buck for a sub $800 laptop with a good build quality.
My kids now happily watching YouTube on their new laptop and Wife can do her assignment on the dining table with reasonable battery life.
I guess I am stuck with Lenovo for a long long time."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"I believe even Nvidia don't offer direct support on their mobile graphics. I recall trying to install a driver directly from Nvidia, and was prompted to download driver from the laptop manufacturer instead. But I believe there was a way to ignore this warning and continue with the drivers downloaded directly from Nvidia.
For AMD, I suspect this could be due to differing settings, i.e. TDP up levels, on the APU which is why they leave it to the manufacturers to deliver their own drivers. So they issue a general one to the manufacturer, and they can then tweak it according to the factory settings."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"for those who are using intel 9260 wifi, does win10 auto detect drivers offline or need to manual install them?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For me, I manually installed them.
Not that hard, just run the installation file."

However NB wise, usually recommend to use driver from manufacturer.
TDP, performance, power and etc.
NB driver usually are not that as latest as from manufacturer.
What to do? Unless manufacturer step up their driver updates.
Been using laptop based on AMD processor + graphic
for the past 7 years.
Not prefect, if you play with laptop with AMD Dual graphics/crossfire
those can crash very frequently.
Only way is to disable such feature.
Just take note on Windows 10, some driver may update itself.
It may be the cause of crash/error if Win install/update themselves
than manual install.
Time to time may want to check if there any update to the NB driver."

i've emailed lenovo last week regarding this matter, waiting for their response. will share once they reply me.
lenovo 1tb hdd add-on is $110...wew"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I don't think they will void. Just avoid any stickers that is covered for the warranty. I don't owe this model but the Y530. I didn't get a 2.5 hdd as cost $110 for 1. They still send me the ribbon cable for the sata connection. If they think it will void, I don't think they will send that cable or encourage to add in personally. Just be extra careful, follow the hardware maintenance manual for easy locating of screws and any hidden wires."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i think so also. usually the warranty will cover everything but the upgraded parts.
but just wna make it in black & white"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hope to hear some good news from you!
Lenovo Thinkpad,No problem at all. Just the upgraded parts will not be included
Lenovo Thinkpad,"they replied me:
then i asked about the harddisk and labor:
can upgrade so long as the upgrade doesn't spoil ur laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,This sounds reasonable. Acer have the same warranty policy too when I enquired some time back. It is reasonable because we get to upgrade or swap parts as long as we don't damage anything while doing it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Best to get a power bank that is native type C. It should charge faster, as oppose to those that uses a Type A to Type C cable.
But you do have to be aware that most if not all portable power banks now won't supply sufficient power to keep up with the battery depletion of the laptop. You probably need a power supply of at least 30W sustained to see the battery level maintain or charge slowly under light usage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Great to hear that.
So gone are the days where they have the 'warranty void' sticker covering the screws?"

Lenovo Thinkpad,"he just used the amd official drivers and manually install the inf. its all over reddit on how to do it
imo, its really childish of him to imply its a user problem when in the first place, the basic expectation of the user when updating drivers is simply go to amd website and look for the mobile ones
amd, in its statements already push the responsibility to oem to supply the drivers.
irregardless, i am getting a t480 simply because i am running linux builds on it. really poor support from amd mobile on the linux kernel as well"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks for the info. True to what u says. I actually need the laptop for work on data processing. Cos I saw this thread mostly recommend r5. 😅
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks for the info!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I have the ryzen 7 too.
Ryzen 5 should suffice in most use cases though.
Ryzen 7 is restricted due to throttling from thermal and wattage constraints.

I would say ryzen 7 may be better if you are willing to do a bit of tweaking thermal paste, etc.
Also, cost premium of ryzen 7 over ryzen 5 is not as large as i7 vs i5, which actually makes a decent value proposition.
I'm personally still waiting on a good undervolting tool for ryzen.
Sent from Samsung SM-G955F using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wow! Thanks for the detailed info. 👍🏻
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Depends on what you are using it for. Personally, I will not recommend upgrading to Ryzen 7. As someone rightfully pointed out, these ultra low power processors, i.e. 15W, cannot maintain its clockspeed on both the CPU and GPU concurrently. Neither can it maintain the boost/ Turbo clockspeed on all cores for long too. So in theory, the specs is better on the Ryzen 7, but chances of it keeping its performance advantage over the Ryzen 5 is slim."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ryzen 5 if sustain load right ?
Ryzen 7 cannot sustain. Will throttle."
Lenovo Thinkpad,What software to uninstall from the laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You got the unit? Mine should be reaching this Wed.
Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you are referring to sustain load when CPU and GPU under load, then even the Ryzen 5 should throttle. 15W for both CPU and GPU is not possible to maintain at a high clockspeed. There should be a TDP up to say about 25W, but will not sustain.
In a given scenario where the cooling system is more than sufficient, you can see how the R7 performs in the below review link."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Any feedback on any issue with AMD.
Home use should be ok but commercial use depend on what the company usage. Certain software are designed to run only on Intel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"HI. What if we set maximum performance in windows and on AC adapter? Does it mean it will still throttle?
Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No, it will still throttle as it depends on facts like the cooling as well as
CPU temp. CPU will throttle depend on load and it's temp.
If you want full performance, can turn off the Cool and Quiet. If present
inside BIOS
However by doing so, energy consumption will be higher especially on
battery.
Laptop lifespan will be shorter since CPU is always running at full speed
thus more heat. Same applies with Intel CPU so not just AMD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This will not solve the problem. The TDP is limited by the manufacturer. Even if you can override the limit, you likely will run into cooling limitations since these low power laptops don't come with good coolers like those gaming laptops."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"To answer the question on whether does the E485E585 ""throttle"", one must first distinguish between the 2 basic types of throttling.
1. Thermal Throttling.
2. Power Throttling.
The pictures shows the behaviour of the E485 under a full CPU load and b full CPU load 4c/8t + GPU load.
a

b

From observation, the E485 2700U cpu did not Thermal Throttle even when the temperature exceeds 85C.
The 2700U CPU did drop to X25 multiplier under full CPU load 4c/8t + GPU load, only when it's Power Limit of 15 Watts? has been reached."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi guys
I had gotten my E585 about 2 weeks ago.
Everything seems to be running well except when i play dota with it.
I have tried to play with it and there will be sudden ""Spike"" in the graphics when there are teamfights.
Is there anything wrong with my PC or should there be any settings that I should change?
I have also read from the previous post regarding running the AMD clean Utility and reinstalling from scratch.
May I know if it is a compulsory step to take?
Kindly also advise if there is anything that I should do to the computer I.e Uninstall any programs or to install any programs that are necessary for the computer?
After looking at the AMD website, I have tried to look for the latest update from AMD Radeon Settings on my computer.
However, I am unable to find the update button in the application.
I am experiencing a similar issue from the post that i read from Reddit.
The screenshot was taken from the post in reddit.
I am not really good in computer except to use for surfing and maybe a little of gaming.
Can anyone advise me in the simplest explanation please.
Thanks in advance"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Usually for new PC, you have to
Run Windows update.
However MS update will update drivers
That are outdated.
By doing so, the system maybe unstable

Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks man
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks man will see.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Weight? Lighter for carrying around goes a long way.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for your explanation and video.
I have ran windows update.
After running Wins update, I have tried to find update from both the lenovo vantage and the AMD radeon setting cannot find the update button from AMD Radeon Setting.
I have completed updating the driver by following the steps shown in the video.
Just a couple of questions,
1 How would i be able to check that i am running on the latest version or to check if there is a new update released in the future?
2 I have tried to open the AMD Radeon Setting. There is a prompt ""Radeon Settings Version and Driver Version do not match. Please try again after updating to the latest version"". What should i be doing now?
Sorry for the stupid questions and your advise is greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You can try downloading the latest adrenaline and install it, just use express installation this time.
Alternatively, you can search for amd/ati cleaner to remove all current drivers, which then after which install the the latest amd driver from amd website. which mostly the pro will recommend
Else if all works fine for now, no BSOD or anything. Just enjoy first, do some benchmarking, do some gaming and carry on with work on laptop until u decided to do the steps above.
*P.S. there's another way of install official drivers from amd website, which is to edit the inf files for ""fully forced"" installations. But u need to read up."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Side note when updating driver.
Enable airplane mode or disconnect any
Active internet connection.
This is to prevent Windows from installing
The driver which will cause conflict when
You try to run installation.
NB unlike desktop, need not always update.
Just check the driver version is the same as manufacturer will do."
Lenovo Thinkpad,so 485 is lighter. but i like 585 keyboard layout with numpad. dilemma.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Personally, i like 15"" notebook as there's likely numpad on it. As for weight, doesn't bother me much as i used to lugging 2kg+ notebook. That's why i ordered e585.
Besides that, 15"" generally have better cooling. But of coz that will be dependent on manufacturer. So far is single heatpipe on e485 and dual heatpipe one e585 AFAIK. That's also another reason i ordered my e585 with ryzen 7 2700u.
As usual laptop bag and mouse on delivery and laptop still ""Released to manufacturer"" so i guess i won't be getting this year.
As for my killer 1535 wifi card, 8gb ram & shin etsu 7921 thermal paste, it is shipping le. Now at china airport hahahahahahahaha"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Iirc, e485 has dual heatpipe. Its the A series i.e. A485 that has single heatpipe.
I like the e485 layout personally as no numpad means the keyboard is more centralised. Kinda like a tkl layout.
Sent from Samsung SM-G955F using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for the reply
1 I have tried to uninstall the AMD software from control panel and reinstall using the express installation option. The problem persist when I have tried to open Radeon Setting.
2 I do not dare to do a clean install in case i screw up somewhere.
3 Everything is working fine. I guess I will not be doing anything to my PC until problem occur Hopefully nothing will happen

Thanks for the advise.
I have already updated the driver before I saw your advise.
Everything went smooth and there were no error messages.
I will take note of your advise for future updates.
For now, my driver version is 25.20.15002.58 which i guess is of the latest version.
Once again, i would like to thank the both of you for your kind support.
Thank you"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You should just consider if you will be bringing it out a lot. If not, then just go for the E585. No point in it being lighter if you don't need it to be mobile. Otherwise, you can still get a E485 and connect a full sized keyboard at home."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Oh my mistake. Thanks for pointing that out. Guess reading too much can confuse one mind. But i guess i'm kinda used to the non centralised layout since been using a lot with 15"" laptop with numpad. And besides, i hate smaller screen. It's like hp i'm using mi max 3 btw, once u get used to 15"", going 14"" it kinda no no for me.
But of coz, each to its own. Cheers."

up to you.
Unless someone else is using the same brand and same ssd, not otherwise cannot be sure that it will work."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Even if compatible, Plextor are not well known SSD brand and the speed can be rather slow than brand like Samsung.
Still recommend you to just configure
It with SSD.
Expensive yes but if you want speed than usually bundle one.
Not to mention for NVME SSD you need the driver so it can perform properly.
NVME driver are not like SATA driver.
If you buy together, the driver is provided within the driver page.
Not sure about Plextor.
Samsung, Sandisk I have used before so they are fast and reliable.
Alternative is Samsung 860 Evo M.2 at $89.
But cheaper SSD usually are just average speed since they do not run on NVME.
NVME cost more that is why it is near $200.
Up to you, if you want to save on SSD than those running on SATA.
For Speed NVME SSD is the best choice but way expensive."

Troubleshoot a bit, damn the 8gb memory from taobao dead on arrival! Then spend 1 hr plus talking to the china seller, in the end bad experience with it don't wish to go into in any further.....
While feeling a bit low on the ram issue, mood pick up since it's holiday season plus my Xmas present e585 is here. Carry on without the 8gb ram from taobao.
Upon booting into windows, killer 1535 unable to start itself shown on device manager. Download update killer 1535 from it official web, cannot work. Tried lower version, cannot work. Then i recall, i order my killer 1535 that time it mentioned it will run on windows default driver. So i went into device manager, show all hidden device in order to remove the original lenovo qualcomm atheros driver, and uninstall it.
Click on refresh on device manager, bingo! It work just fine. Connected to my wifi, big difference! Full bar at my room! Speed shown as 866.7mbps. Downloading stuffs also seems to be faster.
After that update a bit windows, settings and install the latest amd drivers. Everything looks good and snappy. Loving it!
Benchmark a bit on cinebench. Score as 34.9x fps and 549. Do note i still on single channel ram due to DOA of taobao ram.
Overall, love the lappy a lot and definately snappier then my acer aspire 5 fx-9800p with rx 540 dgpu.
For now just hunt for ram again."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for the update. I decided to take risk and ordered the AC9260. Will try intel and killer drivers and see if it improves.

question, how do i reformat windows for clean install? plan is to swap out my 1TB hdd with my 512 850 evo SSD SATA. got any guides?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Great value choice! Normally fresh install is really dependent on individual style.
Anyway lenovo boot default will read usb disk b4 os disk, so you can try this sequence.
1. Create your win10 installation usb.
- this you can just go microsoft web for media creation tool. Note that last i created is having many problems as i wanted install win 10 pro, in the end you will need to change a file in the usb disk which will let you choose the edition. You can find this info readily online.
2. Prepare the drivers, lenovo programs if you want to, especially the hotkey and power settings.
- for drivers is up to you. You can either find individual online or just use lenovo drivers.
- however, radeon drivers i highly recommend you to download from amd and force install.
3. Install ur samsung evo 850 to the lappy by replacing with the sata hdd.
4. Just insert the win 10 usb b4 powering up.
5. Installing windows.
- wipe all partition and format.
- some say no need to format, just wipe all partition, but it's my style of doing
6. After windows setup, install the drivers
- well, last time i used to use this sequence of installing the drivers. Chipset, graphics, monitor/lcd, lan, wifi/bluetooth, sound, keyboard/mouse.
- but now i don't think it matters anymore. Just install as your wish.
- remember, radeon vega driver need to force install. Remember to install ccc2_install.exe after that for radeon control app.
7. Install laptop essentials apps.
- like power management, trackpoint, trackpad
- actually they are drivers!
8. Disable Windows update driver installation.
- you will need this to prevent Windows meddling with radeon drivers.
9. Lastly install ur own apps and update Windows.
Hopefully i don't sound long winded here. Cheers.
P.S. by saying usb disk at the starting part, i meant it is usb thumbdrive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Alright I have bought a 8GB ram from carousell. It's a SK hynix ddr4 2666mhz. According to owner, he took out from a lenovo sff pc coincidentally it's becoz of this i bought it and price was somehow right for me.
My factory set ram is samsung ddr 2400mhz anyway. Install the 8gb ram, boot up without problem, memtest no error. Sweet! On dual channel now. Cinebench a bit, 44.xx fps and 635 cb. Not bad, was very pleased with it.
Played fortnite i'm a noob, don't ask me add u on 1280x720 medium settings, not bad! Fps max near the 70s, avg it stick on 50s to 60s.
Compare to my acer aspire 5 fx9800p with dgpu rx540, which plays at 1280x720 low settings, it a big improvement for me.
But well many things are different between tbe 2 lappies though. My lenovo e585 is 16gb dual channel, newer processor but apu only ryzen 7 2700u, pci-e nvme ssd lenovo oem. While acer aspire 5 is 8gb single channel, no 2nd slot, fx9800p, rx540 2gb dgpu and samsung evo 850 sata ssd.
I think if acer had dual channel, i guess likely will be a draw. Btw both is on the latest amd drivers.
But whatever it is, i'm super happy, pleased, enjoying this lenovo e585!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Oh ya and one more things to add on, lenovo bios vram is set as 256mb by right will adjust up auto if needed, playing fortnite certainly have some impact on the graphics displayed see youtube video on acer swift 3 b4 acer updated the bios to force vram 1gb.
Hopefully lenovo will release new bios to fix that no options to change vram settings. And fyi, current bios 1.46 is on agesa 1.0.0.4 not sure previous bios already on it or not.
Just hope as days goes by this lenovo gem will get polished up.
Cheers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The shared VRAM the system will allocate accordingly.
Actually don't need to increase, same with Intel UHD graphics."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hi guys. Is the default wifi card always one bar even when in the same room as router?   I have not gotten my E585 set yet and  am a bit cost conscious and avoiding buying wifi card
Lenovo Thinkpad,curious of this too.. also can share the taobao/aliexpress wifi card link for $20 bucks
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi, you don't have to worry if the router is in the same room.
For my case I only tested a few mins and my router is in the living room.
Just that was surprised that my acer Intel wifi card though, originally with set have full bar connection whereas the lenovo default wifi card is 1 bar. Maybe need to do settings.
Cheers.
Edit: both laptop is on at the same time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just search for it. ""Killer 1535"" or ""Intel 9260"". Killer one is still based on qualcomm atheros but is 2x2."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"btw was quite surprised that the e585 advertised as up to 8.5hrs..
4hrs like cheating sia.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wow. Better deal than mine!

Lenovo Thinkpad,"I ordered 2 pieces of intel 9260ac from here:

Lenovo Thinkpad,"I cant seem to locate the proper video drivers at amd site. The chip/board selection doesn't include ryzen 5 2500u with vega 8. I also cant find a link to dload generic Radeon Software Adrenalin.
Can someone pls help."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Well you can just select processor with graphic and select the ryzen ones. Typically it is somewhat ""universal"" since most of the time the link will point to download the overall new drivers. You even and try selecting graphics.
anyway for link as per follows:
Latest Beta:
Latest Stable:
FYI, i'm using the latest beta. Do note you have to force install the driver on vega.
To install the Radeon Control Center, just go to the extract directory and search for ccc2_install.exe
Cheers"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Got it. Thanks alot bro
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes I do know it will allocate accordingly, but some games are not ""smart"" on this. They will stick with the default min allocated which is 256MB.
Fortnite is one of them, not sure if it's fixed by Epic, but during my game I do notice the graphic rendered is a bit strange on it. But still good playing on it.
There's a video on Acer Swift 3 on ryzen on playing fortnite when the bios is default min allocated 256mb and another updated video with updated bios forced allocate 1GB as min allocated. You can check on it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Well, all manufacturer's is like this, overly exaggerating batt life. Even mobile phone also have this exaggeration.
But ok la, I'm used to this kind of battery life since I don't really use much on battery. Max only use 15 to 30mins on batt each time, and 4 to 5 times if so."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya, his configuration is a very good deal. I configured b4 with 16GB ram and NVMe 512GB without SATA HDD though is cost $1077 with sgnight code.
After which I change it 8GB single piece and it cost $967, which i used the $110 savings to buy wifi card and 8 GB ram.
But heck should be have just configured it to 16GB 8+8 to save the hassle of the rams on my case lol.
Anyway it seems like now today it's more expensive by $100 to configure similar configuration. Guess the -$100 ram upgrade is no more."

i do wish they actually just remove the HDD compartment and increase the batt size. would be perfect already."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Its sort of ""universal"" just take the vega options windows 10 64bit."
Lenovo Thinkpad,So is fortnite issue or lenovo?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Those 2 wires are antennas. Can just unplug and plug onto new card.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"That is the WIFI Antenna, two color coding + & - so take note of
the polarity. Wrong placement the WIFI won't work properly.
Be gentle when unplugging it, just gently lift the wire will do."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Well it's more likely pointing game software issue since software by right should ""know"" vram on apu.
Some say it's AMD issue due to drivers.
Others say it's Lenovo issue coz they like more bios control over this.
Overall it take 2 hands to clap."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks bro very helpful...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone self installed SSD? can share some pointers?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"this is based on e580 which should be the same as e585..
gonna refer to this when my 585 comes too"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I can tell you that more than 90% of laptop manufacturers always quote battery life that only they can achieve. At least I know only Apple is very close to quoting a close enough battery life so far.
Anyway, battery life is very subjective to usage patterns from person to person. To you it may be 4 hours, to some may stretch it to 5 hours or less than what you are getting."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeah.. I think 880 for a budget gaming machine is really not bad lol.. I am amd fan boy, good to have my laptop and desktop in team amd"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyway for those who are interested in try this
. According to a post in
, it normal installs without much issue, meaning no need force installed.
FYI, this Radeon V1000 is embedded series with Ryzen of coz. Driver version will be a bit strange 18.40.12, which is released on 19th Dec 2019. It's the same time release of the newst beta drivers.
However this driver seems to bring back the native resolution bugs not sure what is that. I will try it soon."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"OK, I have test install the drivers from V1000.
I uninstall AMD drivers using DDU in safe mode, restarted and boot into windows normally. Check the driver on device manager, shown as Microsoft video adapters. Installed the 18.40.12 v1000 radeon drivers, restarted.
Boot in windows, check drivers, Vega 10 drivers shown as ver 25.20.14012.2001 dated 27/11/2018.
Ran Cinebench to test, 637 cb and 43.xx fps. Tested some videos normal videos not 4k, looks ok.
Will run on this driver a few days to test out.
Sidenote: It seems the system ran a bit faster and smoother, i guess it installed the ""chipset"" drivers as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Is not + or -. Is 2 antenna some pc has 3. Is main antenna/secondary antenna. If reversed, signal will not be as good."

My Dell laptop is using Sandisk X600 SATA 3 not NVME.
X series is OEM SSD meaning not sold in retail"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Did you set the keyboard language properly?
SSD wise depend on your budget.
If you are tight on budget, get m.2 SATA3 interface SSD.
If got budget than go m.2 NVME SSD.
Difference between SATA 3 and NVME SSD is NVME SSD
is faster than SATA 3.
But you won't be able to tell the difference unless you are
doing heavy computing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Does it have a green screen video issues?
Or just the screen go blank for second when opening YouTube vids .. doesn't happen all the time.
Could be chrome itself though."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"So far no, did not encounter it. I'm using chrome as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,so got feel that the system ran a bit faster?? so far I still feel it ran faster than previous.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think he meant for the older generation of thinkpad. older generation have whitelist. so far from what I have read, seems like all the newer thinkpad doesn't have bios whitelist anymore. I could be wrong."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyway, there's a new BIOS update for E585."
Lenovo Thinkpad,hmm funny.. they shipped out my bag and laser mouse first.. laptop usually in another shipment? lol doesnt make any sense right>?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"think might have to give this a go.
*Update*
Gave the v1000 drivers a go
-uninstall old drivers via ddu in safemode and restart
-install the v1000 with express install function.
Easy installation.
Doesn't seem to fix the youtube video issue though, the screen just go blank for a second, only happens sometimes when switching videos, lesser than before after installing this v1000 though.
Did a simple game test.
Ran the popular fortnite.
Full HD, medium settings, avg around 30 to 40 fps.
The game doesn't look pretty though and during the parachute portions, it certainly lags.
overall seems snappy for task that is not too intensive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"come from different places i guess.
its normal.
bag and mouse always arrive first."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I did not managed to benchmark the old driver. With the v1000, I can get 39 fps with my Vega 8. Gut feel is the video is smoother.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Got the green patch screen in youtube with the V1000. Hopefully the next version can fix.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi.  Tq.  I am a casual user and therefore, the higher throughput of a better wifi card is not important to me.   My only consideration is that signal strength as indicated by number of wifi barsshould be normal as I move around a house."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Think e485 also got the same bios update.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You should go safe mode and uninstall with ddu.
So far after I clean install, the green screen issues seems gone.
Only encounter occasional blank refresh on YT videos."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It's average at best.
Definitely not gonna win range awards."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Link to lenovo support
1. Key in the laptop model, E585 or E485
2. After you key in there will be a popout below the search bar, click on download link
3. Under Bios/UEFI, there will be 2 links for download, one to create bootCD, other BIOS update utility
Just choose the options you prefer, it's quite safe to use the Bios Update Utility which install via Windows. Just make sure your power is plugged in.
Cheers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, E485 have the same version of bios released for it. However b4 that, there's also a v1.47 for e485 only which I think fix only one simple non critical stuffs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya, I think i gotten it as well now. it will blank almost the whole screen while switching videos, but rarely. The blank screen only 1-2 sec, so it doesn't bother me much."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Thank you everyone for the feedback.  Average range is suitable for my needs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Found it. Thanks.
Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Was thinking of 12gb ram.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Basically you need the drivers to work properly.
Take note try not to use drivers from either MS Windows update
and manufacturer or even third party.
Desktop is fine but laptop wise, it may affect the performance
and not to mention battery.
Disconnect internet or unplug LAN during Windows installation.
Graphic card driver seems the common concern here as it
affect the NB stability.
Try to use driver from Lenovo, if really buggy than use those
from AMD.
Third party driver for use with AMD Ryzen APU, Vega 8/10
like firepro/embedded series.
It may work but take note, even if it can increase performance.
The power consumption could be higher, just notice the fan noise.
If it is really loud, opt to revert to manufacturer driver.
Cuz manufacturer driver there are some customization as well as it
set what TDP it is running at.
FYI I use AMD notebook since AMD Turion/Phenom II days so I been
playing with AMD way early than most.
Since for most notebook they would use Intel than AMD.
Ryzen NB have been the best in my opinion so far."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Noted thanks alot.
One thing I'm unclear: do we still need the realtek wlan and bluetooth drivers if we switch out the atheros for ac9260? i.e. are realtek's drivers some kind of base drivers that the wifi card's drivers require?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For my unit, the stock card was Qualcomm, not realtek. I believe there are certain CTO that may be able to configure to realtek wlan etc. If you switch out to other brand wlan, then you need the new brand wlan and BT drivers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Depend, some WiFi card are combo card with BT.
But for what I see you need both BT and Wi-Fi driver.
Depend on what they ship, if it is Realtek than use Realtek driver.
If Qualcomn than use the appropriate driver for it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ok I get it now, just pick a set of wlan+BT drivers depending on your wifi card brand. Lenovo provided realtek and qualcomm cos they must have shipped with either of those brands' cards."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, need not worry.
Once you receive just check under device manager.
In doubt can ask here."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyway, there's a driver update for AMD by lenovo released on 27th Dec 2018.
Go to lenovo support page for more info"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi, i can see that you have been posting updates often.
May i know how do you know when there is a new update?
Do you visit their support site everyday?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Some is proactive check their site.
Simply just Google ""E485 driver"" and you have it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yay mine shipped from China ups.. How long it takes ah?
Lol received the bag and mouse today.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Info from reddit & sometimes i do go check on it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyway..... Lenovo updated drivers shown as mid oct drivers and seems to solve the youtube blank screen..... Ok i shall refrained from posting updates. Cheers
-gone with the wind-"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It's OK, you can post here.
I am only here to share/help AMD users since I use AMD NB
during Turion/Phenom era.
But I am currently not using a Ryzen based NB so need
someone to post any update if you noticed here.
Thanks and cheers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The graphics drivers seem to be late December one.
Release on 27 December for Lenovo
25 December for the driver itself?
It solves the blank screen issue? Thanks will try!! Hope it works.
*update* tried the latest driver from lenovo for the gpu.
Doesn't solve the blank screen issue.
still happens for me.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"For those already swapping components straight after getting the laptop, is there no warranty void / non-tamper warning sticker at the back panel for this?

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi
Please do not get me wrong. I do appreciate your effort in trying to inform us when there is an update.
I am just curious as to how do you know of updates. I thought you have some notification or something that will inform you that there is an update and that is why I would like to know or enable it.
Since you have mentioned that you do get info from reddit and sometimes check on it, I guess I have to be hardworking like you to look for updates on my own."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks. No stickers will help. As some laptops put the stickers on a screw so it will be obvious if it has been opened up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can I get an advice for my overall learning?  Can I confirm that most users who order a HDD with their E585 and then immediately swap it out to their own SATA SSD is for the following reason:
A they need a HDD for other usages and it is cheaper to get it as part of E585 bundle
Thanks in advance.. for my config, I ordered a HDD = blank so that I can put a SATA SSD into the empty cavity."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It depends on your setup.
1. The bundle hdd is typically slightly cheaper than open market. But we are talking about just a few dollars difference. Data in hdd are easier to recover.
2. I have a 500gb ssd from my old notebook to recycle. Hence I do not need those smaller ssd from Lenovo.
3. You still need a storage for Lenovo to put the bundle OS. Why not pick the most value for money?
Happy New Year!

Lenovo Thinkpad,"OK too bad then, I try for this 10 mins for this driver and it did not show any blank screen. basically keep switching videos for 10 mins and it does not show the blank screen. Hmmm wondering it's chrome problem.
Now back on v1000 drivers, fornite i also same like yours now, 1080p all disable except far view and high textures, fps 40s to 60s."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For my case, i been using ssd. Previously one my acer amd lappy i have one 500GB samsung evo 850. Wanted to put in my Lenovo E585 but heck the normal 1TB HDD spoilt idling for 1 yr outside my drawer. So My Acer now is back to SSD and passed to my sis, niece and bro-in-law for usage.
I may put in a normal HDD into the SATA in the near future just for data storage. If i feel rich enough, then I will get SATA SSD.
For your case if your NVME SSD is 500 GB I think it is enough for you to store most of the things. If 256GB, it may enough for now, but as time goes on it will choke up eventually with all updates and proggies you install.
EDIT: Oh, saw your later post. Yes that will be a better choice in the later part since mechanical HDD is always cheaper."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am still on v1000. So far I only see the green patch once. I don't think it occurs frequently. Let's see.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just my two cents, SSD don't need to get so big.
Use SSD for OS and core programs, take note of SSD
tend to wear out faster than HDD.
128GB should be bare minimum since OS will take about 30GB or so.
For storage just store them into a normal HDD, slow yes
but bigger space and less expensive than SSD.
Games, videos and etc. best to put on the HDD, in case if SSD
fails or wear out. At least your files on the HDD so you can
retrieve them easily.
Take note SSD for both E485 and E585 are NVME type thus
much expensive than normal SATA SSD.
If you want cheaper SSD than get a normal HDD with the laptop than
buy a separate m.2 SATA SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is the laptop still worth buying because new ryzen is going to be out

512GB Solid State Drive M.2 2280 PCIe, Opal 2.0
Guys, any idea why the PCIe / NVMe description is different among the 3 choices from Lenevo?
Does it mean that the 512GB option does not run on NVMe protocol? And the 256GB option is on mSATA?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,V1000 drivers seems better to me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,V1000 drivers seems better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Would suggest wait for ces and see what they release.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you can wait than it would be 3000 series.
But doubt the pricing for the new chips be that as low like current.
Release date could be mid of 2019 so can be a long wait usually
for new chips here."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya precisely, I guess it will be a waiting time between Carrizo and Bristol Ridge likely."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"That era not worth waiting.

Played with those lappy before, CPU really CMI but the IGP
is the only better part of it.

Anyway next week than we know what AMD have.
So far no news about the H series, yes there is H series but
I doubt any manufacturer want to use it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya, got my Acer bristol ridge during that era, which acer make it worst by releasing single channel model in Singapore.
H Series will land on desktop replacement model likely those gigantic 17.3"" like asus rog lappy, if it releases for it."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Err.... should be able to.
The IGP vega 8 is close to MX150.
R7? Are you talking about a different laptop?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Maybe..haven't tried.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks for the feedback. I was referring to Lenovo E585 with AMD Ryzen 7 processor.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am not sure. I was a bit baffled by this too.
I got the 512 SSD even though I wasn't clear on this point I assumed that if the connector was PCIe, the protocol would always be NVME coZ I am not aware of any manufacturer that uses any other protocol with PCIe."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Cuz there is AMD Radeon R7 series also.
Go ahead, under $1k laptop with performance near Intel u series
with MX150 is very hard to find."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"do you all experience a yellowish tint to the screen, I'm comparing my laptop to my desktop monitor and the difference is quite significant
my night mode is off."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hi .  Is your ram 1x8 or 2x4?  Just taking a poll.
Lenovo Thinkpad,1 x 8gb ram.

Lenovo Thinkpad,I did not ordered mine with SSD. Intend to buy one to use it for OS. Is the windows key burnt into the MB sorry not so sure how to say it? Meaning I simply use a USB Thumbdrive to install windows to the SSD and then recover the windows keys. Or I have to clone the HDD into the new SSD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Laptop/Desktop starting from Win 8 era, the CD key is embedded
into BIOS so need not key the CD key.
However if you have other version like pro than you
need to activate the CD key after installation.
Create a USB thumbdrive installation and install from fresh.
Fresh OS will give you a much smoother and faster OS than
the pre-build OS."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyway it's called monitor inf in lenovo terms. At support web you can find it. If not just try in device manager and let it update via online. It's still lenovo but version is higher then the one listed in lenovo support web.
Lenovo Thinkpad,I think it will hang there for a long while.
Lenovo Thinkpad,I am on 6.10.0.0. The Lenovo website version was older than mine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"for those who're considering changing the wifi card, you may like to know what I got as ymmv:
-atheros original 200-266 down, 220-284 up
-9260ac new 340 down, 210 up
UPDATE: 9260ac with new intel drivers released Jan 2019 400 down, 130 up
for info my LAN cable gives me 900+mbps both ways. With new drivers giving improved down speed I feel the upgrade is worthwhile now, esp the intel card being 160mhz capable thus future-proofing, despite lower up speed for me.
EDIT: Other feedback
Overall looks really nice and sturdy. Love the aluminium top and other little touches like the lighted red dot, lighted power, esc, caps lock and numlock buttons. Also, easy enough to open for upgrades.
Don't fancy the trackpoint and idiotic location of Fn key used Bios to swap with Ctrl key but have to inform EVERYONE who may use my laptop and hope they can remember this oddity
Did a fresh install to get win10pro on the cheap, installed whatever was needed from lenovo support site but Apps and Features no longer list SmartAudio 2, Synaptic Pointing Device Driver and Thinkpad Ultranav, though all works normally. Now can no longer press Enter to reach Bios during boot, have to press shift+Restart."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For those who upgrade the stock Wifi Qualcomm chipset.
Performance wise varies, not to mention the card driver
is generic wifi driver from either Intel and etc. parties.
Just my two cents, not all Wifi card can perform well
on this laptop since there it was tested nor optimized for
use on it especially BIOS.
The tested and compatible card is either the:
- Qualcomm ACA93777
- Realtek® RTL8822BE

By default it seems not able to choose alternate Wifi card.
If want the Realtek one, can source for it but take note it should be for Lenovo Thinkpad.
Or get from local service center but can be pricey."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yours might be limited by router, my E585 changed to intel 9260 can reach 420 down & 310 up on 5GHz."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"What tool you used to measure? I saw the driver showing 867mbps in windows.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Is the battery life of e485 still bad?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Slight confused now. Trying to order a SSD for my new Lenovo E585. Can I confirm that I can just get any M2.SATA SSD or that it must be M2. NVMe SSD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"get a M.2 NVMe SSD.
It comes with nvme SSD. Not sure if the M.2 slot supports SATA.
Anyway you will appreciate the much faster speed of nvme"

Than create a thumbdrive.
Do prepare all the driver so you can install them."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks everyone. Will try out tonight.
Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Does that mean after the fresh install, on the hdd/sdd, there is only the windows partition? No uefi?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,blur about uefi..
Lenovo Thinkpad,"UEFI is expected to eventually replace BIOS. Like BIOS, UEFI is installed at the time of manufacturing and is the first program that runs when a computer is turned on. It checks to see what hardware components the computing device has, wakes the components up and hands them over to the operating system.
I think the vendor stores the hardware diagnostic program in this UEFI partition."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"After windows installs on a new drive, it will create 3 partitions without drive letters:
- System, EFI Partition ~100MB
- Unused Partition:Recovery ~499MB
- Reserved Partition ~16MB
During installation, if you have old disk running windows plugged in, then the EFI and Recovery partitions will not be created as they're already on the old disk. Windows will boot fine but will fail once old disk is removed.
To avoid this problem, remove/disable other OS drives before installing windows. If you cant, then use Macrium Reflect Free to move EFI and Recovery partitions to new OS drive from old drive. Windows will now boot fine independently of old drive now. Last optional bit to do is let windows know you only have 1 OS, so google for easy steps to remedy this if you like. This was the process I just went through."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"What is this error about ""Radeon settings version and Driver version do not match. Please try again after updating to latest versions."" fark AMD"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks for sharing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"When updating driver, disconnect from internet or put in airplane mode.
Probably Windows 10 install the driver while you update/install
the driver version.
As when Win 10 detect any device without driver, it will just install/update
on it's own.
Conflict of installation, not AMD fault but MS."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Found this on internet and worked for me:
Open Registry Editor, go to [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\AMD\CN]
Look for DriverVersion.
Remove the value listed - leave it blank.
Then either reboot, or restart Radeon Settings.
This should solve the problem."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Check with u guys, if i bought with both 1TB HDD and 256GB SSD, the Windows OS will install on which drive?"

Lenovo Thinkpad,This laptop had officially outdated today with newer models.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Source? E490 is Intel based not AMD.
Other than that model, Lenovo have not announced update model
to E485/E585 yet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,They had been announced and selling on website now. 13 hours battery life.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Don't see the amd based ones.
Only see the Intel's one.
Even if got new amd ones, not sure if the performance difference is worth the upgrade, probably for those that haven't bought the older model."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"How does a brand new working laptop suddenly become 'outdated' when new models arrive? I dont follow the logic.
Anyway, feel happier with the e585 the more I use it. Looks really 'handsome', unlike other budget laptops. Appreciate lenovo following through with consistent design principles from their top end X1 Carbon/Yoga series right down to the e585, which makes me feel really nice.
Weird thing. I get distracted by the trackpoint in middle of keyboard so I try to avoid it and end up with typos.. ha"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Agree, especially the chip use is just a refresh.
There won't be any major improvements or big jump in performance.
Unless there is Thinkpad based on H series than maybe
a different story.
H series TDP is higher at 35 watt as compare with U series at 15 watt.
I doubt Lenovo will want to release a Thinkpad with H series
since that is more for gaming than work."
Lenovo Thinkpad,next gen of AMD mobile processors was just announced last week. not even released yet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"FYI these Thinpads are announced during CES 2019
Thinkpad X1 Carbon

Lenovo Thinkpad,"I have been using it for two days now.  I am quite a budget person and was happy to have good value for money.
On the stock Wifi card, the behaviour was quite acceptable for my low end usage it ranges from 230mbps up/down on LANSpeedtestwhen i am in the same room as my router and drops to 6mbps up/down on LANSpeedtest when i have two wooden doors separating my laptop from the router. I find 6bmps still very acceptable for my very low end usage and was aware of this compromise at this price point.
As such, no intention to upgrade the wifi card.
P.S:  6mbps is not a typo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I received the promo email and initially thought that it was AMD new release.  Upon further reading , this was clearly not the case, the actual phrase was ""Optional AMD discrete graphics."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi folks,
May I know is there somewhere I could take a look at the E585 screen to see how bright it is before I order online? Thanks in advance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I doubt this model even the showroom at Bugis/Causeway point will have.
Closer model you can compare is e480 but that is Intel based.
Screen wise should be more or less the same since it fall under E series."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hijack a bit. Anybody used L380 before? How is it?
Need a laptop for school/home. With education pricing, L380i5+256gb SSD with 3 year warranty + upgrade to 16 GB ram @$1297 good deal?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Gotta wait for the amd ones bah..
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think the manufacturers have successfully brainwashed you to think a new model means better. While it is newer, the improvements regardless of Intel or AMD chips are negligible of late. Unless there is a something significantly wrong with the older model, then may be worth looking to see if the newer model will address this issue. I don't see it in the case of the E485/585."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hmmm whenever got fb video playing, screen will go full black then flicker back.. on latest v1000 drivers for  e585.. still not resolve..

Lenovo Thinkpad,"I probably will stick to the stock Wifi card when I get my E485. Its mainly for work and studies, so don't need wonderful transfer rate."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is the graphics card driver a common issue on these laptops? Intending to get this as a desktop replacement and connect to 24 inch monitor.  Watch alot of YouTube videos.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Errr... I rather you build a AMD Ryzen DIY PC instead if you do not

Lenovo Thinkpad,More reason to get a DIY Ryzen system than a NB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"with new intel ac9260 drivers released Jan 2019, I now get 400 down, 130 up consistently.
the down speed almost doubled from original atheros wifi card, so it's definitely a worthwhile upgrade, despite the poorer up speed for me. I've edited my previous post accordingly."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"May i have the Taobao link please?
On a separate matter, I find that Lenovo plastic panels fit very well and therefore have very small gaps.  I have to use my car panel removal tool to snap it open."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I don't know how to DIY full setup so have to rely on SLS or pre built. The price point for the SFF in the link is also quite way off this laptop once I load in similar specs as I'm going for 16gb ram.. This laptop price point is really quite unbeatable due partly to the ram discount. .
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can ask in hwc, saw some setup less than $600. But if you are looking at 16GB than the price will be higher since DDR-4 prices are quite high."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I did post the link several pages back. anyway:
yes I feel lenovo cases are well made too, having opened acers before hate opening acers btw. for e585 case opening I start with my thumb nail at front corner, then slip credit card in and slide along edge carefully. can be slightly nerve-wrecking for first timers. also many tiny screws and delicate parts, so if no real need and not confident then better leave the laptop alone but can your itchy fingers resist?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"btw not sure if some of you are aware can get shopback rebate from lenovo online orders. I was skeptical, didnt take it seriously, then received email about pending $40+ cashback to be paid out to me on 9 March prob to guard against product returns. now i'm a believer."

P.S. Anyway fyi, for those who did not know, killer 1550 is using intel 9260ac chipset. Cheers."

- if you will never use the camera, like me, for extra privacy/security, you can hole punch out a sticky note sticky part then stick the circle over the camera. it fits perfectly. looks even nicer if you colour the sticky black before punching."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Well, I haven't got mine yet. Just ordered yesterday. Lol. Will try once I get my hands on it.
So far info is what I have read on."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Just installed my VM Ware Pro 15 on my E585 this evening prerequisite: had to turn on AMD virtualisation in the BIOS.  Was very happy that VM Ware works without a hitch and my virtual machines are functioning normally need my virtual machines to do sales demo on my laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"FYI, between E485 and A485.
There is Thinkshutter meaning the webcam there is a shutter to conceal it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"wah.. they even gave that shutter a name..
I forgot 1 more tip: entirely optional if you did not fresh install windows after swapping wifi cards, then the old wifi card drivers are still in there. open device manager, click View tab, enable Show hidden devices, expand Bluetooth and Network adapters, right click old wifi card to uninstall the drivers.
Despite doing this and rebooting though, a qualcomm wlan driver service still runs. I dont know how to remove it properly so i just deleted three related files from windows-system32-drivers folder."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Preload OS most of the OEM drivers are included inside
the OS. Just uninstall from device manager will do."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just a heads up for those looking for bigger nvme SSD.
Crucial P1 1TB for less than SGD 200 on newegg, free shipping to SG:

Ordered 1 to upgrade my E585. best price for 1TB nvme SSD so far.
Shall keep the stock lenovo 128GB just in case for warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"A quick check, when you ordered your E585 did you also included the hard disk?
Was thinking to not order the SSD to lower the price of the laptop then buy cheapest SSD and install."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"When you bought under student discount, is it using your school email?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wow! The price is incredible! Thanks for sharing. Do share with us on the performance.
Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,When you register for an account at the Lenovo Education Store you put your school email address as email address. That becomes your Lenovo account name.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Nope no HDD, only 128GB SSD to tide me over until I found a cheap 1TB NVME
Anyway Lenovo includes the SATA cable and the dummy HDD"
Lenovo Thinkpad,is it student discount auto applied?
Lenovo Thinkpad,It is not auto applied. During checkout the system will detect the promo code and ask if you want to activate it. You can choose to activate it or enter another promo code. If you log on to the education store it will propose you the promo code for student. If you have a better code you can enter it and get better discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,HI Bro.  Can I confirm that both the SATA cable + dummy HDD are inside the laptop itself? It wasnt in my UPS shipping box.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yup it is installed in the laptop itself where the HDD would be.
If you unscrew the bottom panel of the laptop you can see it immediately."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Heng ah! TQ!!!!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"After using for two days, this laptop is so worth the money $550!!!! haha kinda sad i did not pay the extra 90 dollars to upgrade to a 2500u"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I actually saw this on Prime Now yesterday, but decided to go for the Crucial MX500 1TB 185 less 10 bucks POSB CC promo instead after reading the review. While it is a decent enough NVME SSD at below 200 bucks, it is running QLC NAND, which I am trying to avoid. In most day to day usage, it should not be a problem."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Sorry I missed your PM for a couple of days. I usually uses the mobile phone to read HWZ and thus don't check mailbox. Hope that the answers on this thread sufficiently answered your question. Student discount on Lenovo is $300. I believe there are some promo discount code that can give $250 for adults. The difference is only $50.
I believe it is not just Lenovo that are giving discounts to students. I think Apple Store also have similar student type of discount. It is wonderful time to be student in Singapore."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ok had some free time so decided to test vega's real-world gaming capabilities. Should be able to breeze through old game like TF2 correct? Nope, lagged occasionally even with graphics tuned down to medium low settings on LAN.
Task manager showed bottleneck with dedicated gpu memory used up all 256mb, but the 5.8gb shared gpu memory remains untouched. GPU usage between 30-85%.
We know e585 is no gaming laptop, but still a little surprised it could not handle an old low spec game smoothly throughout despite having an igpu.
my specs: ryzen 5 vega 8, 8+4GB ram, nvme SSD, default video drivers, default radeon settings.
UPDATE: Solved. I changed the settings back UP to high defaults, even adding 2 X MSAA. Much better now no lag just a tiny lag sometimes when very intense. Makes no sense except that that must be its 'sweet spot'."
Lenovo Thinkpad,8 + 4 GB? Don't have a Ryzen laptop on hand so for me I can't test.
Lenovo Thinkpad,U need to update the drivers. Default one is not good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Eh, I have played a few rounds of TF2 on my E585 Ryzen 5, 24GB RAM, NVMe SSD at FHD and maxed out settings and never encountered any issues.
Playing on AC power of course, havent tried on battery yet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You mean the alternative drivers? I downloaded them but not installing yet unless really have to and gains are significant. My impression is the alternatives are not super stable?
Default drivers no issue so far."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"isnt MX500 limited to SATA speeds?
yeah the Crucial P1 is QLC but they say its endurance of 100GB writes per day for 5 years so I have no issues with that. Not going to be running benchmarks or downloading large files on my laptop everyday."
Lenovo Thinkpad,No lag at all even during intense action?!? What radeon drivers you using? does task manager ever report shared gpu memory being used?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"nope, not even when pushing the kart with all 20+ players clustered around the final capture point.
have to go back and check, didnt really monitor task manager when playing.
I didnt install any custom drivers, only updated via the Lenovo Vantage app."
Lenovo Thinkpad,hmm.. our machines are pretty much the same. I still have 3+gb ram free during TF2 so that's not the issue.... hmmmmmm....
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Could it be ur 4 + 8gb ram?
Heard the ryzen/vega performance r very dependent on dual channel memory capability."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yes i expected perhaps difference of couple fps, but shouldnt be so drastic..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Could be cuz different size and speed, dual channel may not work optimally.
But depend on the chipset so best to use CPU-Z to see
is it dual channel.
If on budget than add another 4 to make it 4 + 4 so Dual channel
can work."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Your RAM 8GB + 4GB are from the factory? is your RAM running in dual channel mode?
I ordered mine 8GB RAM from factory, added another stick of 16GB 2400mhz in. Luckily it could run in dual channel with the factory stick."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yup checked they're in dual channel mode 2400mhz.
in any case, the difference to real world use is supposed to be very minute. I think it's due to something else.... hmmm"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, its limited to SATA speed. Considering the fact that use both 970 Pro and 850 Pro on my current desktop, I never really felt that the 970 Pro is significantly faster than the 850 Pro when running apps or OS on it. So I really don't see the benefits of NVME, at least not in a day to day usage.
I've read the reviews on the P1 and I don't quite like what I see. The performance fluctuations are too huge, and while I expect QLC to be cheaper than TLC, it is not the case at this point."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Monitor the temps and the clockspeed for both the CPU and GPU.
Anyway while the system is the same, it also depends on what applications are running in the background that will take up precious resources."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If it is only CPU, the impact may be limited, i.e. not all applications will benefit from a higher memory bandwidth. However if you consider that the CPU and GPU are sharing the same memory, if its not running at dual channel, it will have a significant impact on performance when both are under load."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Here is what I see in task manager during TF2. I have 24GB RAM in total, 8GB+16GB in dual channel.

Playing at FHD resolution, most details on high and v-sync off.
typical 50 FPS, drops to around 35 FPS during intense parts of the game"
Lenovo Thinkpad,more details from GPU-Z max values while playing TF2
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks kangdi and others for leads and advice.
EDIT: Solved. Since it works for kangdi, I decided what the heck and changed the settings back UP to high defaults, even adding 2 X MSAA. Much better now no lag just a tiny lag sometimes when very intense. Makes no sense except that that must be its 'sweet spot'.
I must've lowered settings earlier trying to fix that tiny lag....... and made it worse"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Don't look at the max values. You should check the real time clockspeed. The APU cannot sustained at max clockspeed, especially in games when both the CPU and GPU are under load. The limitation is with the 15W TDP. Its got a TDP up, which I suspect should be 25W that allows the clockspeed to go up temporarily. It can't sustain it unfortunately."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Seems like there is new official drivers from amd.. not sure if it works though.
Lenovo Thinkpad,where did you see the new drivers?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For people with E485/585, is it possible to change the system language from English to Chinese so everything is displayed in Chinese with the included Windows 10 Home?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Amd website.. but doesn't seem to have support for ryzen laptop yet?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think there is a new version released on the 21 Jan. However, its likely for the desktop version."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Finally got my E485 today, and I gotta say I really like the build and the classic Thinkpad look. So far I did not run in any issues with it, though I was wrestling to clone the OS drive to another M.2 drive because I believe is due to licensing issues. Upgraded it with a Crucial MX500 drive with additional 8GB ram. Will spend more time to explore it. I did notice that there's no Radeon software installed for the GPU. Is that normal?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi bro.  Any pro tips for opening back panel for the faint hearted like me?  Everyone has a different way of opening .
I am not sure if I have the Radeon software."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Loosen all the screws and start working on the sides of the laptop first. The are being held tight by some clips that will easily open. I used my finger nails, but it hurts. Haha. You can use a plastic card or some flat plastic to slide along the openings. Do not use any metal object as it will likely scratch or chip the plastic. Once the sides are open, I tackled the back of the laptop. The front seems very tightly shut, but will come out once 3 sides are opened.
The plastic used is quite thick and sturdy, so generally you don't have to worry about breaking something. As long as you don't yank it open, it should be fine."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Tq.
Noted on the nail technique"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Just curious how long did you wait?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I waited two weeks. Not sure if it was because:
1. I ordered on a Friday night.
2. My notebook went from Hefei --> Shanghai --> Incheon KR --> Shenzhen then to Spore.
Their committed delivery date is accurate. It stated two weeks......."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Got my unit around 2 weeks too.
Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,About a week and half.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I was also perplexed by the need to ship out of China and back, before it is enroute to Singapore."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyway after playing around with it for awhile, I noticed that the back light of the monitor seems to flicker randomly. Not sure if anyone had the same problem before? Also I experienced corrupted graphics once in Hardwarezone forum, which I suspect is driver related.
Other than these, so far its been working well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Try to update the driver? I noticed flickering when on battery. On AC seems fine. Still not sure whether it is driver related.
Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Flicker only when it's on battery, not sure if it is due to driver issue.
Corrupted graphics try to install the v1000 drivers. Should help reduce.
Otherwise wait for the new drivers that amd promise."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeah, that is correct. It happened when I am running it on battery earlier. I did not pick up this flickering issue yesterday when it was charging.
Noted on the driver update."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wireless network speed is quite decent. I ran Speedtest and got 325Mbps down and about 310Mbps up. Network card is a Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am also able to achieve the same throughput as you indicated when I am in the same room as the router.
However, if I am separated by two closed doors, the throughput falls drastically to about 30mbps strangely downlink is affected more than uplink.
Therefore, despite my initial position of not changing the wifi card, I have placed an order for the  9260 wifi card because of sharp fall in throughout."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just ran some quick test on a classic game, Company of Heroes 2. Despite the age, it is still a pretty taxing game for the Vega 8. Minimal frame rate at approx 16, highest about 31 @ 1080p low graphic settings. But the good thing is, I observed pretty good temps when using it in conjunction with my laptop cooler. Max temp recorded was 71 degs and while the fan noise is audible, it is still very soft."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I see. My router is placed in the middle of the house, so even in the living room, I am getting a solid 2 bars with 5G channel. Did yours downgrade to 2.4G resulting in a steep drop in WIFI performance?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi Bro.
Yes.  You are right on all points.
Behind two closed doors , my 5Ghz dropped to no signal and 2.4ghZ dropped from full bar to two bars.
Therefore, you are also correct that in two closed door situations, only 2.4ghZ is detectable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,seems like the latest radeon drivers fixed the one time flickering black screen when playing  videos
Lenovo Thinkpad,"From which site?
Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,1.9.1.2?
Lenovo Thinkpad,How do you folks update the graphic driver? Just download and install directly from AMD's site?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeah for amd vega
But my installation seems weird.. I did clean installation cause normal installation doesn't seem to update in amd ccc"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Got it. My driver and Radeon software installation seems messed up as well. I checked Vantage and they gave me the option to install the Radeon Software. After installing and when I tried to launch it, it gave me an error that my driver version and Radeon Software is different. It will not launch..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I also encountered this issue a few days back. Googled and found a suggestion that worked for me. I rebooted the notebook after making the change.
---------------------------------------------------------------
This is a trending issue that many users are running into. Here’s how to fix it:
Open Registry Editor, go to [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\AMD\CN]
Look for DriverVersion.
Remove the value listed - leave it blank.
Then either reboot, or use the tool provided with CRU Custom Resolution Utility to close and restart Radeon Settings.
This should solve the problem.
-------------------------------------------------------------------"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thank you. Will try those steps. It's not a show stopper problem, just minor annoyance why it did not work out of the box. Haha."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"downloaded 19.1.2 and just accept and custom install.
seems to have fix the black out screen problem?
monitor for awhile more."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i kanna one BSOD.. so reverted to vantage drivers.. let me know if u kanna also
edit: seems like this latest drivers dated this yr, its not really installing the latest one under device manager dated apr 2018"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"so far i what i can confirm is the black screen still persist, much lesser though.
i check.. even though its installed but the device manager drivers shows april also.
odd."
Lenovo Thinkpad,What hardware do people normally self-upgrade vs choose to ship with purchase?
Lenovo Thinkpad,SSD and ram can self upgrade because it is likely cheaper.
Lenovo Thinkpad,I moved back to Lenovo display driver after i ran into flickering issue with the HDMI output on my Samsung TV.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Would you void warranty or is there any risk here?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Risk is only when you do a botched upgrade and end up damaging something in there. Otherwise, you can always remove the ram and storage in case you want to send it back for service to play safe."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi Guys
sorry i have a noob question. i have downloaded 19.1.2 and was trying to update the driver in Device manager.
However, i am unable to find the ""AMD Radeon Vega 8 graphic"" at 3.53minute mark of below video which was shared in earlier pages
May i know which one should i choose instead?
Thanks in advance"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I tried this couple of days back. The good news is it works, and I can launch Radeon software. The bad news, it freezes and not useable. When I hit the Global settings, it just froze and unresponsive. Had to force close it after waiting for sometime. Haha."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I think in another forum posting someone suggested that enter the version number to be the same as the actual Version on your notebook as opposed to leaving it blank. I kept it as blank as I do not update graphic driver yet.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Today, I popped in my Taobao AC9260 replace stock wifi card + Amazon Samsung 850 Evo 1TB into the dummy tray.
**it was not me opening the back cover today - my friend with long fingernails helped me**"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Cannot just run express install?
if not install the v1000 drivers, its probably easiest."
Lenovo Thinkpad,LOL. You need to pay for his or her manicure.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyway, I thought the dummy tray is quite silly. It's pretty heavy, almost the same weight as a real 2.5 inch mechanical drive. If one is just running the Nvme drive, best to remove it to shave at least a good 100+ grams off the laptop.
Anyway, may be can share the improvements in WiFi speed after upgrade."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi guys.
**Please note my test are with speedtest.net.  I
did not
test with LAN-speed-test-program because my synology server which I typically use as a destination is under some maintenance**
My throughput when separated by two closed doors,
Stock wifi:  30mbps up/down.
Non stock wifi meaning AC9260:  160mbps up/down.
My throughput when sitting next to router:
Stock wifi:  200mbps up/down.
Non stock wifi meaning AC9260:  390mbps up/down."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi guys, looking for a cheap laptop for school use. Was on lenovo educator store playing around with some customization, any that you guys recommend?

Above specs cost $807.03. Trying not to hit over 1k."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ram wise either 2 X 4GB or 2 X 8GB.
Or you can get ram elsewhere.
Single channel will impact the performance.
So dual channel would be preferred."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Nice. Thanks for sharing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Really big improvement. Glad I replaced it.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Can SIC your taobao AC9260?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Get dual channel config. 16gb imo is better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Are you getting a E585 or E485? You did not select a SATA3 harddisk. I assumed that you want to buy and install yourself. There is another thread where the TS stated that his E485 did not come with the empty harddisk tray. For the E585 it does come with the empty harddisk tray. From your pricing it looked like you are ordering E485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"That guy is talking abt A485, not E485."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi All.  For my self installed Sata3 SSD, I did not place the Sata3 SSD in the metal enclosure since the metal enclosure has no screw thread to secure it to the chasis on it.
That means with or without the metal enclosure, the Sata3 SSD is held in place only by the Sata3 socket.
Maybe I should stick a double sided tape the next time I open up the back cover."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Call Lenovo for the cage.
Cuz if you drop or bang the laptop.
The SSD may pop out easily that is why a cage is needed to secure it.
Double side won't work due to heat.
Overtime the glue will melt than the SSD will still drop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I thought the holder is some kind of flexible plastic part?
Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yep bro.  Flexible plastic with some aluminium strips.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Okee.. I have the cage i took it out and put on my table.  Looks like I have to use my nails to open the backcover tonight
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can used a card or plastic knife to do it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Aiyo.  I just reached home and realised that I have a dummy SSD but there  was no cage attached.
Did yours come with a cage wrapped around the dummy SSD or you had to separately call Lenovo for it?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"There is no cage as such. It is just a soft plastic that goes around the dummy drive, which you use on the SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,OK.understand.  I have emailed Lenovo to request for the plastic spacer you described.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I have did the express install.
It was mentioned that the installation was completed.
However, device manager shows the following.
Driver date: 13/9/2018
Driver Version: 23.20.826.10752
Did i install it wrongly?
Edit: I ran an update via Lenovo Vantage
Driver date: 4/10/2018
Driver Version: 25.20.14002.1"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I am running VMware Pro 15 on E585. No problems. VMs are working as expected.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi Bro.  I just tested my 850evo with Crystal and the sequential read/ write is around 2000Mbps/1300Mbps.  I was surprised because I tot Sata max out at around 500Mbps.
Why ah?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This is a strange metrics. Anyway, if it is Mbps Megabit and not MBps Mega Byte, then it may be correct. SATA 3 maxes out 600 MBps theoretically."
Lenovo Thinkpad,For SATA Driver? Is it MS AHCI Driver or AMD AHCI Driver?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thank you.  I understand now.  Paiseh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Nothing to be paiseh man. I am just thinking why Crystal mark will show in Mbps instead of MBps.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Have you gotten it? Any update?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is E585 form factor 2280?   The manual doesnt indicate.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"recieved it 1 week ago, installed windows with no issues.
really decent speeds with around 2000MB/s read and 1500MB/s write sequential. slower than WD Black or Samsung 970 but those are easily twice the price.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can I confirm that similar to US sites like Iherb, I should order from Newegg using USD to avoid Citibank currency conversion fee?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Whichever way, you will be hit with the currency conversion. In the case of iHerb, if you check out using SGD, the price is already inclusive of conversion rate. If you choose USD, then the credit card company will perform the conversion and impose a charge on it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Between the Crucial P1 and MX500 1TB both M.2 format, I will go for the latter. While the MX500 is limited to SATA3 speed, its been proven time and again that most people will not experience any tangible improvement in user experience between an NVME and SATA3 drive. I've recently switched from my Samsung 850 Pro to 970 Pro, and can safely confirm that there is barely any improvement between the 2 in usual day to day usage, i.e. Windows/ application startup and app installation.
In this case, I will go for the drive that offers better endurance and consistent performance. On Amazon Prime Now, the P1 was going for less than 200 bucks, and the MX500 at 185+, both M.2 format."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For Iherb, if I check out in SGD let's say 88 Sgd, my Citibank will have two lines:88sgd line one + 0.88sgd line two."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hmm... I tot mx500 only on sata format. Thanks for sharing.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"I bought the 2.5 inch format MX500, but there is an option for M.2 format."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeah, I get that too. But I doubt switching to USD make a difference. Credit card companies typically don't offer a favorable FX rate."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi, considering this for light office use - mainly school work. Is this laptop’s E585 wifi card that bad?
Any guides to replacing it?
TIA"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Easy to change the card, search youtube for a visual guide."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Its not that bad to be honest, but really depends on your expectations. I have been using it for more than a week now and I have no issues with the WIFI performance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,New drivers for GPU from amd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Dear Bro.  Please refer to the following youtube for T480.  The back cover design is quite similar only difference is two hinge design for T480 vs one hinge design for E585 but it doesnt make a difference in terms of taking it off .  The video also shows how to disconnect your wifi card + 2x antennae.
I agree with forummer watzup_ken that the stock wifi card is quite ok.  For me, i chose to replace it because i like to sit in a windy part of my house that happens to be a dead spot and also wrong placement choice for my router which i dont intend to correct anytime soon."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am running CPU-Z and under Graphics tab inside the Memory section it says my memory size is only 256mb. Is that correct? I am having E585 with Ryzen 7 with Vega 10 graphic.
I am unable to play Gear of War 4 and I am getting error GW410. It says my memory is only 0.2gb and cannot play the game."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Generally, it's better to pay in USD and take the credit card foreign currency transaction fee + VISA/Master fee total about ~3+1% than to pay in SGD with dynamic currency conversion check their conversion rate against google or whatever. Especially true if you're using miles cards that give you bonuses for foreign currency transactions.
If you're using debit cards or credit cards that give cashback <3-4%, you might want to consider using something like youtrip load SGD, convert in app to forex, pay with forex to avoid those fees. There are quite a few of those cards around these days, so you can shop around to see what you like."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I agree with you when it comes to buying from Amazon or Newegg. In terms of IHerb, I don't see a big difference in terms of buying with SGD. Which is why I switched from USD to SGD when buying from iHerb."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Unfortunately you can't change the memory dedicated to the iGPU here. It is dynamically allocated. Also can it run GOW4? On the desktop variant, I am sure it can run at low settings, but on this ultra low power APU, it may not be playable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i think its dynamic?
max is 2gb?
unsure of this."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"anyway the latest gpu drivers from amd doesn't seem to have much difference in terms of bug fixs.
still awaiting the drivers from amd that they say will release.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,GOW4 need 2GB of VRAM which unfortunately means need a dedicated graphic card to run it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Sian x 100. I bought this game for fun last year. Only played it for a short while on my son's desktop. Was planning to built a ryzen rig but decided to buy E585 instead. Now the money put into this notebook is no longer worth it. I thought I can play some games on the notebook. Just a causal gamer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Certain games
iGPU won't be able to handle/support it so need a
dedicated graphic card."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can play, just not the gfx intensive ones.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"u should have done your research properly.
nevertheless, u can always sell it off to fund for your Ryzen Rig instead"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It will run some games, but realistically, it is a 15W APU, so I won't expect it to run as well as what you read for the desktop variants with significantly more power to share for both the CPU and GPU.
So assuming that the memory is not an issue, I believe it will also be a stuttering mess for this game."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks bro, my router is pretty near where I usually work.
Thanks, very helpful and useful video! Yep probably wont replace us for now since my workspace is pretty much covered."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Then it should not be a problem. For me, I am quite close to the router when using it at home. And if I do bring it out, it connects to my phone for WIFI, which will also be near."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I read the starting of this thread in July 2018 have $200 discount. Now cny 2019 also have $200 discount. When I was placing order after 10pm, discount changed to $250. Sweet..... Decided to order one set."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Do you want to share with us which model and configuration that you ordered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,I am using E585. How do we go into BIOS? I tried F1 during startup and it does not work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, I noticed this happens on one night as well. The usual code ""AMD18/ AMD19"" that gives 200 bucks discount will become ""SGNIGHT"" that gives the 250 bucks discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You can either,
1 At start up, hit ""Enter"", then select F1 to go into BIOS at the selection screen, or,
2 Hold Shift and restart the PC. When the screen appears, you need to look for one that allows you to select ""Troubleshoot PC"" and then Boot in UEFI."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"And need press quickly if you are on ssd. I missed most of the time.
Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks. Point 1 does not seemed to work. Point 2 works except during boot up I must press ENTER to enter the Bios, else it does into normal boot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Press enter fast.. lol
SSD very fast."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I ordered E485, Ryzen 5, 8GB x1, 256GB ssd, 65W ac adapter for $857.03 with SGNIGHT discount"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I see. When I shut down, I always hold Shift before I hit the shut down button. I read somewhere that if you don't do that, it goes into sort of a hibernation mode, which bypasses the BIOS screen. Not sure if this is the reason why you can't find that screen to press ""Enter""."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Good buy, but I would still opt for the cheapest SSD if I choose again. I feel the SSD upgrade is quite expensive. For example, I can find a Crucial MX500 1TB SATA 3 SSD on Prime Now for 176 bucks after 10 bucks discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yup. I think the difference here is the pressing of the SHIFT key during shutdown. Else during bootup the interruption message followed by ENTER option will not appear on the screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I agree too. I had actually initially selected the 128gb ssd. But after the extra $50 discount appeared after 10pm, I decided to just go for the 256gb and not bother having to manually upgrading it.

Lenovo Thinkpad,I believe you will add in another slot of ram? Optimal to run dual channel for this APU because of the shared memory for CPU and GPU.
Lenovo Thinkpad,the SSD for 2280 confirm is NVME? not Sata right. any good deals?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"NVME SSD usually cost more than SATA.
NVME is faster but not noticeable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yes, it is a NVME."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, its NVME."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"To add on, it cost significantly more. One usually pays a premium of at least 30% when between a SATA3 and a good NVME SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hello guys, I just put in my SSD
What program would you recommend to move the OS over from the default HDD to SSD?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If I have a new SSD I generally prefer to re-install the OS rather than cloning the OS. Your windows keys are already embedded into the BIOS. After you have re-install the OS you can then find the key and activate Windows.
The advantage is that you have a clean installation. The disadvantage is of course it is a tedious process and you need to copy the drivers over. I would try the clean install first just for knowledge learning. If it dun work then you clone it lor.  I have already used the clean install method on two machine last year alone.
I cannot recommend any cloning software as it has been a while that I clone OS liao."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I saw a few 1TB priced down. They are getting affordable.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Depends on the SSD brand, it may come with a cloning software. My preference is Acronis."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Still awaiting the official amd ryzen drivers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This is supposed to be released every quarter? Anyway, I am still waiting for AMD to make good on their words to improve driver support on their mobile chips. They really need to be serious if they want to gain back market share in the mobile space."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just my two cents, I think the new driver will come like this:
- Release to manufacturer first
- Generic Mobile Driver to follow

Since AMD Ryzen 3XXX series is around the corner.
Laptop with the new chip will come with the newest driver.
Probably once 3XXX series are officially out than the generic
driver mobile will follow.
Probably june or so so for the meantime check the manufacturer website
they will definitely get the driver first."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Time consuming and not tedious u mean? Cos most of the time is just waiting for it to complete. And by right it will also auto install the required latest drivers? No need to copy over unless you want specific drivers to use.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Auto install required latest drivers is more common for desktop installation. For notebook I observe that manufacturer tends to has more specific drivers that we need to either download from their website or that we must take it from one of the folders from the original drive. Take the AMD drivers for example, we can't use the one from AMD. We must use the one from Lenovo.
Maybe it is my lack of experience that I find it tedious AND time consuming. Still clean installation is a better way in my opinion."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi guys, if your screen is experiencing green or black flashes during video playback, I think that it has something to do with the driver's handling of Direct3D 11 hardware acceleration.
One way is to disable Chrome's hardware acceleration.
However, instead of disabling hardware acceleration totally, you can also try this workaround:

Lenovo Thinkpad,"For notebook whether Intel/AMD, best to use manufacturer driver.
Especially if the driver for graphic Windows install is for
desktop than battery as well as performance will be affected.
Not to mention certain devices have certain features/add-on
which is only enabled through the standalone alone installation."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I always disable the hardware acceleration in Chrome. It seems to cause more problems for me, not just limited to this laptop. For example when I was using a combination of Intel + Nvidia hardware, Chrome will keep crashing until I disable hardware acceleration."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Suppose to release first quarter i think..
the new 3000 series is coming already.. so i suppose drivers will be out soon?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"trying the optional tip.. hope it works.
but i still hope that the official drivers will fix all these issues. Don't have to use all this tricks to fix the problem.
*update* just using opencl makes some website unable to load.
if use no hardware acceleration, the cpu load is much higher.
Though its still plays 4k smoothly.
I really hope amd comes out with more such VEGA apu.
Really like the AIO combination."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all. Any differences between e485 and e585 apart from the size/weight? Thinking of getting one for the wife, she only does light browsing and video streaming, so don't need to be mobile with the laptop. Ryzen 3 sufficient or should get 5 or 7? Thanks"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"3000 series almost here the first laptop will Asus FX505dy
AMD Ryzen 3550H with Radeon 560X.
Driver most likely will come by than."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"14 inch vs 15 inch, if you want portability than e485 will do.
Recommend Ryzen 5 as Ryzen 3 is dual core while 5 is quad core."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For web browsing & video streaming, a Ryzen 3 with 8GB ram is more than enough."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I also support the idea that Ryzen 5 is better than 3. Notebook can last three years and it will slow down as technology advances. We can't upgrade the CPU in notebook. If the premium is bearable you want a higher CPU. I bought Ryzen 7 for this reason.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For portability. get the e485, do note this is not ultraportable though. so don't expect it to be super light weight also.
ryzen 5 at least imo cause of quad core."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hopefully..
really need some good drivers"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Today I opened up my laptop and to install a hard drive and decided to apply some after market thermal compound to see if it will help bring down the heat. Taking the heatsink off is very easy, just loosen the 4 screws holding the heatsink to the processor, and a light pull and the entire heatsink and fan will pop out. Just be careful of the fan power cable because they look very thin and flimsy. Anyway, I think I may not have installed the heatsink back well cause seems to be getting very hot. Like at idle, its 60+ degs, and easily hit 80 degs. Haha. Not sure why the CPU seems to be working very hard. Anyway, more work to do before I update again."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyway, I just wanted to check what is the idle and load temps that people are getting on this laptop with a Ryzen 5 please? I wanted to do a comparison before and after, but now I don't remember how hot it used to run.
I've not reapply the thermal compound again, but I did noticed that the temps run high as a result of initial high CPU usage. I did noticed that the clockspeed seems to hold above 2.2 Ghz in most cases, 200Mhz higher than the base clock, with short boost to over 3Ghz."
Lenovo Thinkpad,What thermal paste did you apply?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I used Thermal Grizzly Kyronaut.
Anyway, I opened the laptop up again to check. Tighten the screws more to improve the contact. I can feel that the heatpipes heat up really quick throughout including the heatsink, so I think the  contact is good. Problem I believe is with the fan profile. The fan only seems to kick in when the laptop hits about 62 to 65 degs, otherwise, it is not spinning at all. Also I noticed slight coil whine, which I initially thought was due to the fan. But I observed the fan was not spinning and the slight humming sound is not coming from the fan."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If temp not improving, suggest try another thermal compound like Noctua.
Can get from SLS.
Tip to secure back the heat stink correctly.
You have to secure the screws diagonally.
This is to ensure proper pressure so the heat sink is secure to the CPU.
Meaning top right to lower left and etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, I did this. Thermal compound wise, I believe the Thermal Grizzly is one of the best out there other than liquid metal. It worked well with my graphic card, so I thought might as well use it on the laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,A good estimate of improvement will be idle temperature.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Many factors can cause wild fluctuations. Thermal profiles can be finicky. On my Dell, if I wake it up on battery, it will sometimes throttle itself to a certain frequency e.g. 1.89 of 3.46GHz.
Plugging in and out the charger will cause it to ""remember"" that it can turbo and now it turbos all the way even on battery. Results in higher temps too."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I cannot really ascertain whether it's poor contact here. The temps can swing from 45 to 80 degs all of a sudden. In this case, the entire heatpipe and heatsink is very hot. So I don't really think its a contact issue. But I will revalidate it by removing and reapplying a fresh new coat of thermal compound later this week."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyway before I start tearing it apart again, anyone can share their idle and load temps please? I tested mine in a non-airconditioned room. Temp as per probe is about 29 degs. For mine, it idles at 45 minimal and loads to about 80 to 82 degs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually, measuring idle temps might not be the best yardstick.
Most modern laptops will put the fan into fully passive mode and fan spin can be triggered anywhere from high 40s to around 60c depending on the motherboard. So you can get possibly higher idles on a better paste and lower idles on a poorer paste while the reverse is likely true under load
So temperatures at the same load will be ideal. At the same time, thermal grizzly's viscosity changes at 'out of tube' and steady state after thermal cycling. It'll ""dry"" noticeably and that's expected behaviour, overapply is a must.
I do recall Roman Hartung der8auer who's basically thermal grizzly saying somewhere the paste longevity shortens at the high 70s. In contrast for notebooks, I'd lean towards moderate or high viscosity pastes like NTH1/NTH2 and Gelid. High viscosity ones tend to work better with low mounting pressure i.e. laptops"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeah, I did figure that it will be difficult to gauge since it is not going to be an apple to apple compare.
As for the overapplying, point noted. I wasn't aware, and applied a thin layer on it as what I used to do with Arctic MX4."

This is when I am gaming on it, so I think the results are really good. I believe there is no need for curing with Thermal Grizzly, but it is good to see some very good improvement in thermals. Anyway, I did not reapply the Thermal Grizzly although I was planning to previously."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"wow finally found a interesting thread. Was thinking to get a cheap enough with enough average performance. Mainly into working laptop for excels, maybe some programming, youtube, surfing internet, and some school related work. Looks like this E485 is the one that i should be getting.
How do you guys cost save on this one?
I needed some form of normal HDD for basic storage and a SSD fast boot.Upgrade from Lenovo is +70 which i think should be fine right
Samsung 970 EVO Plus Series - 250GB PCIe NVMe - M.2 Internal SSD USD 90
I guess i probably need a 500GB HDD basic one, which does not need to be high speed. Any advise?From Lenovo +60SGD
RAM wise, believed that 16GB should be optimalRam from Lenovo is 170
RAM DIY Upgrade ~ USD 110 for 2 X 8GB
How about wireless card?
saw some upgrade on this as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My recommendation is to get the most basic SSD, and 1x 8GB ram. While I pad about 737 bucks for m E485, I then spent about 65 bucks on another stick if 8GB, and slightly less than 180 bucks for a 1TB Crucial MX500 SSD SATA3. Total damage is less than 1k, may be closer to 980 bucks. No need to go for NVME SSD since every review out there proved that there is not much improvement over SATA3 SSDs, other than in benchmarks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"thanks man, how do you know which ram is compatible?
On this E485, does it have space to install 2 HDD?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all E585 friends, glad to have found this thread.
a Can someone show the brand and timing of the original 1x8gb ram?
We have to buy the same ram as much as possible to run dual channel right?
I heard ram is very expensive locally now
. Where can we buy this ram online, any links?
b Is it better to buy our own SSD and install it?
Which SSD should we buy, any links? Maybe budget about $200 for it...
c Can this E585 play Dota 2 on medium or low settings?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Only 1 HDD and 1 m.2 slot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"a If you find it expensive, can just get 2 X 4 GB first.
Down the road than upgrade.
b The SSD that Lenovo have as an option that is a NVME SSD
so it is much expensive than SATA SSD.
Just get the 128GB SSD together with the laptop will do."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, but there will be spikes when you are low on battery."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Will the system auto download and install if I do system update, or must we manually download and update ourselves?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You can let OS install the driver but at risk of
performance and stability.
Best to install separately, if you let the OS install.
Usually the drivers are for desktop but not notebooks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ram is the most basic ones, ie. DDR4 2400 with CL17 timing. Even if you get a faster one, it will still run dual channel but run at a slower speed.
SSD, personally I feel its cheaper to buy your own. Like I mentioned earlier, you can get a good Crucial MX500 1TB Sata3 at a modest 180 approx.
DOTA2 performance, I can't really advise since I don't play it. But it should run this game pretty well based on reviews out there."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Some mini review after using the lappy E585, Ryzen 7 2700u.
Overall it has been great so far for my usage. Previously installed the Killer 1535 atheros wifi card on it. Nearly 1 mth usage, I began to experience overheating on the wifi. The back casing where the wifi card located is super warm, which in turn causing massive network drops at time. The network drop is experienced during gaming, it will just lag like no tomorrow, even bringing the laptop near to router is no go. Coincidentally, I have ordered intel 9260ac during that time, maybe it senses I changing it out lol. Changing to ethernet connection will immediately solved all note: powerline network. There's also one strange incident spotted, no matter how strong/weak the signal is, it will reported as 866.7mbps connection speed. I guess it is going to uplorry, no intention for rma since buy from taobao and the process is rather troublesome, plus it's only 20ish, just treat that i smoke 2 packs of ciggy lesser, lol.
After gotten and installing the intel 9260ac, now connection in my room is around 70% with speed reporting from 300+mbps to 400+mbps depending on the signal strength. Overall speed is pretty stable compare the atheros on my own feel. Moving the laptop closer to router will get 866.7mbps connection. Have not tested on the 160mhz settings since the router is a singtel oem one. Changing to starhub one soon as I recontract my fibre tv for free 2 years fibre Internet and will given Linksys router. Then maybe i will try to see if I can configure for the 160mhz.
Before the official amd support on mobile ryzen released, I had installed the amd v1000 drivers, forced installation of the latest adrenaline driver up to 19.2.2. So far they been performing well. With only rarely occasional green screen on youtube. Anyway i did install the chipset driver prior using forced installed graphic driver. And oh ya, i forced installed RX Vega, not vega 8, vega 10 or vega 11. However with the release of 19.2.3 it did installed smoothly on the dot for the graphics ddu b4 that of coz, but youtube green screen become quite prominent. So i have to disable hw acceleration on chrome. Maybe it's the first official release somemore it's considered beta, so likely it will mature like a fine wine.
Overall laptop idle temp around 44°C on non aircon and 40°C on aircon super low temp, 18°C on aircon, workplace as my boss is pengiun. On load maximum experience at non aircon is 85°C on stress test 2hr and 77°C. Load At aircon did not measure, but should be better.
Gaming wise after that I have not tried since super busy on work. But overall, loved it very much. You can say this is the best lappy I ever owned.
Next up will try to repaste the thermal paste and try the mobile ryzen master hack found on reddit to play around with tdp envelope when I have time.
Cheers.
P.S. To bro bluestone27 your pm full, thanks for the interest on the killer 1535 wifi card, since it get overheating issue, i not giving away anymore. Thanks for your interest."

My Ryzen 5 e585, so far so good. Moving to AC9260 was a good move.
Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"TQ Dragon for the review.
Like you, I do not own a 160mhz router.  Therefore, since my router is 80mhz router, each of my router stream stream is capped at 433mhz and therefore my Intel 9260 also max out at 2stream x 433 Mbps = 866 mbps
Regarding the influence of heat on my Speed test throughput - my observation is that when my laptop is first nice and cool upon starting, 9260 has good throughput.  After about 10minites in a non air-conditioned room, the laptop will be hot , at this point the throughput will drop to about half for me.  It is surprising that heat has an effect on wifi card throughput."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Strange, my current driver was newer than AMD website, 18.12."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Alright today starhub came and install the fibre tv, ont & linksys E8100 router. However cannot find 160mhz settings despite online says it is 160mhz 1.733gbps capable.
Strangely, intel 9260ac seems to hate this router. In my room, handphone show full bar but laptop jumping up and down. Speedtest starhub server on handphone, near 300mbps up and down. Speedtest on lappy ranging too much 150mbps+ to 250mbps+ download and now I kena the upload bug 45mbps+ to 60mbps+. Bringing laptop near to the EA8100 router, connected speed also jumping 500mbps+ to 866.7mbps. Speedtest also same bug on upload locked at 60mbps+.
Lol. Dunno what to do liaoz.
EDIT: oh ya to mentioned this, my office 250mbps fibre line using tp-link router does not have this issue. Up and down stable at 250mbps+ starhub, also network connection speed all the way 886.7mbps. it's business plan."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hi bro.  could it be possible that your office has a lower temp and the wifi card is not as hot?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I tried using outside my office non aircon for a period of time and connected speed still 866.7mbps and speedtest still managed to get my office speed.
Btw my office is a small single unit high roof with a 2nd floor. 2nd floor split into halfwooden partition , one for office, one for recreation and smoking corner. Router is generally place in the centre of 2nd floor.
Edit: So likely my intel 9260ac don't like linksys EA8100. Play with a lot of settings on the router liaoz, change channel la, put to ac only, set to 80mhz la. Same, no solve. At least the singtel oem won't have such issue, but heck it's okie just need to wait for my new powerline adapter and just connect to powerline ethernet. My current one i used it for fibre tv.
P.S. I staying at my sister house and starhub i'm paying for it. So very hard for me to lay cable. Waiting my 2 room flat singles scheme to be built in 2 years time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I have the same problem. e585+9260ac+ea8100
dlink 868: ~400mbps
linksys ea8100: ~150mbps dload below 100mbps upload was worse at ~90mbps until starhub tech adjusted some settings but this was the best he could do
Many others are complaining about the ea8100 too.
Btw, ea8100 is not 160mhz capable, it is multiple 80mhz capable. 9260ac works with 160mhz capable routers for max performance but there are very few such routers and very expensive.
I have an Acer with 9260 and it's getting ~400+mbps from ea8100, which is interesting."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks bro. So that confirms my guts feeling that the intel 9260ac hate the linksys ea8100. Oh well i can live with it, no issue. Will be mainly connecting to powerline ethernet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"thing is, see my last sentence an old acer upgraded with 9260 works fine with ea8100... so may be the combo of e585+9260ac+ea8100 not working well together... hope someone else with this combo can also chip in to confirm."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Probably e585 only compatible with certain WLAN card not to mentioned the driver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Oh my mistake lol. Missed out that sentence.
Well at the meantime, i can just use powerline ethernet at home, so not much of a biggie issue for now.

You have order the cage and connector thereafter as spare parts. Some others have indicated these parts can be bought online. For E585 the mounting cage comes along with the machine even when 2nd HDD is not ordered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"wow, good info for potential buyer to take note.
If buy HDD + SSD config, where does the OS/Win10 reside?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"What the general view of E485?  I only read the first and last few pages of this long thread.
Price is very nice, I customize one that came up to $815.
Customized specs below, is this sufficient for general desktop, office apps, youtube, school use?  Any comments appreciated.

Is the Ryzen 3 CPU fast enough?  If only M2 SSD as second drive, can it still start or must I choose something for first drive?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,The group here did not get conclusive evidence on this maybe because no one has ordered both yet. I assumed OS would be on SSD using common sense but I now accept that common sense cannot be applied to this model since we found out cage is not included.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ryzen 3 should suffice but I generally tries to buy the highest CPU speed I can afford. Other parts can be upgraded easily. CPU is more challenging to upgrade. I bought ryzen 7.
Edit: I just noticed you are using the promo code AMD19 that gives you a $200 discount. Not sure if there are better promo codes now. A month or so back there is a SGNIGHT promo code or something similar which will appear after a certain hour in the night. There is also DBS/POSB promotion which you can find under the SALES option on the website. Lastly if you have a student in the family the education promo code may also give better discount of up to $300."
Lenovo Thinkpad,:AMD Radeon Vega 3 Graphics is a separate Graphic processor with it own core & memory or its like Intel 600  integrated in the main processor ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Integrated if I understand your question correctly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi guys,  can the e585 use a M.2 2280 1TB PCI-Express 3.0 x4 3D NAND internal ssd?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I don't know if this is a recent thing, but I ordered my E485 with only the NVME drive, but it came with the 2.5 inch hard disk cage. I only got my laptop slightly more than a month back."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I believe it should support.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The price jump from R3 to R5 is quite big, but I feel it is worth it from a performance standpoint. Storage wise, you need to have at least 1 drive. So in your case if you chose SSD, then you don't have to select a mechanical drive drive 1 in this case.
Also if you are not going to upgrade the ram on your own, it is recommended that you select 4GB x 2, instead of a single 8GB.
If you buy later in the night, I am not sure what time exactly, you can use SGNIGHT code that should give you 50 bucks more discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Take note Ryzen 3 is dual core while Ryzen 5 is quad core.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks guys for all the good info, didn't know got so many code, is the education code public?
Yes the $ jump from Ryzen 3 to 5 is something to think about.
Another one on my mind is Acer Swift 3, looks sleeker but also more expensive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,U can check out the HP 14-cm0109au laptop which also uses Ryzen 3 and Radeon Vega 3 Graphics but at a much lower price..
Lenovo Thinkpad,"IT Show 2019 Ryzen3/i3, 4GB, 125GB class shootout

Similar performance, same price bracket. Which one and anymore models to consider?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Asus X505ZA Ryzen 5 2500U at $749, take note you may need to upgrade to 4GB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you have a student in the family i.e. those with email account ending with edu.sg they can register for an account under Lenovo Education Store. By logging onto the education store you will be able to select the same machine using the education promo code default and will enjoy up to $300 discount. The difference is only an extra $50 compared to SGNIGHT. So don't feel too hard up if you don't have one.
Once in a while the site will offer ram on discount that make the purchase even more value-for-money. I made use of both the education promo code and ram discount to get my E585 ryzen 7 at slightly below $900 with 8gb RAM. It was during the christmas and CNY period when they really offered good deals."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I thought someone on this thread mentioned the HDD cage was missing in the E485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeah, I saw it. Though there is no confirmation if they omitted it accidentally, or deliberately."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone using a type-c usb hub as a desktop replicator with this Lenovo notebook? Will the power from the power adaptor be able to pass through the hub and reach the notebook? Planning to connect the notebook to the monitor via the hub.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You will need the Lenovo USB 3.0 Ultra Dock,


If you use 3rd party USB 3.0 Hub it may not able to power
the laptop properly so best to get the dock that is certified for use
with the Thinkpad."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Looks rather bulky...
Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,And expensive too.....look like those cheap usb hub won't do the job.
Lenovo Thinkpad,If you were to buy 8GB RAM. Does it come in 2 sticks 4GB + 4GB? All Ryzen capable of dual channels RAM access? so a 4G+4G will be faster than a single stick 8G?
Lenovo Thinkpad,If you are ordering from the Lenovo website they have option for you to choose 2x4gb or single 8gb. The general consensus in this thread is to buy 2x4gb to make sure of the dual channel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Uses Display Link right?
mai la."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, ordering from Lenovo website. sorry, need some spoon feeding. Cant find the 4+4 options on the Configurable Components page. Only have 4 then 8. Or did you guys buy 4GB part on the checkout page?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you are not planning to open it up to upgrade on your own, then best to select the 2x 4GB option. Yes, it will be faster with the ram running in dual channels."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I can try this tomorrow. Don't know where I placed my Type C to HDMI, USB and Type C power in adapter."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Please help to test today....
Lazada got sales this weekend. Fingers itchy want to press...."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I noticed they remove the 4 X 2 configuration.
Either get 4GB or 8 GB depending on your budget.
Once laptop arrive than just add another stick."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for checking up the site and reply. Looks like they removed that option during IT Show. Also prices are nothing special for IT Show; from earlier Jan 19 posts, people are seeing the same price even slightly lower. Hope they restore the 4G+4G after the show."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Tested and it works for me. I did not try out the HDmi connection, but I was able to charge and use the USB 3.0 port on the adapter."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thank you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Oh yea. Bro.  Sharp eye.  I didn't notice.They also removed the 8x2 option.  They also removed the 500gb SSD option..
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Reading thru the reviews is scary. How come so many ppl got the blue screen of death Crash, even on simple task like watching youtube? Is this because of Ryzen or motherboard or drivers? Some of you guys have updated drivers & bios. Have these 2 eliminated the BSoD?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Graphic driver issue, however AMD mention some notebook will face such issue.
For me if I got chance to play with Asus AMD ryzen laptop.
See whether is it really certain laptop have such issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I've never encountered any BSOD so far. I don't use YouTube often. Mostly for work, playing some lighter games and watching movies on Netflix/ iTunes."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Watch youtube everyday, never happened to me, no problems at all. I simply use AMD official drivers and turned off chrome's hardware acceleration."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is this the thread with no hdd cage? It is a Lenovo A485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Oh dear.....A vs E. My bad.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"so far updated all to latest no more bsod.
just remember to disable hw acceleration for chrome if u use."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks. Realise that A485 has Ryzen Pro 3 2300U; it is shown with pricing but not selectable. Not ready yet?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Maybe not ready yet or OOS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"HP Ryzen 3, $499.
HP Notebook - 14-cm0109au / 4GB / 128 SSD / 14"" / WIN10
Lowest cost 'gaming' notebook?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It is very cheap for the specs indeed. But beware that in order to get to this price, surely there must be serious corners being cut. Even when AMD definitely charges a lot less than Intel for mobile processors, it is not easy to get to 499 that comes with a SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lazada sold by seller who called HP, using HP logo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Zero info on what kind / model of SSD it is. Given price, it may be M.2 SATA, which is alot slower than the NVMe M.2 drive of the Thinkpad E485/E585. Also TN panel for screen and only 1 yr standard off-site warranty for this HP laptop. Hmm"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"SSD is SATA
LCD is 1333 resolution meaning non full HD
4GB ram
Price is suspicious, any link?
Up your budget get either E485 or Asus X505ZA."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It is on Lazada at $499...
think it is a glossy display, but price is cheap."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It's up to you to decide, if it were me I will go for this instead."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"That's why I mentioned there will be serious cost cut to get to this price point. But to be honest, it's still very good in value to me. At this price point and in the Intel camp, you likely will get a Pentium Silver laptop with 64/128GB eMMC, and not even a SATA3 SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Later today at 1pm there is a flash sale.. the price is most likely gonna be < $499...
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Nope, I'm wrong... the price remains the same at $499.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Now Lazada has HP discount. If use $6 discount will become 496. If can buy another item then can get $50 discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Oh ya hor.. r u thinking of getting it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Nope. I kaypoh only. Owned the E585 which I already seldom use.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lol ok.. hey do u know if Intel Pentium N5000 quad-core is better than Ryzen 3 dual core for a laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My E585 is a Ryzen 7 and I have not used Ryzen 3 yet. I do have a mini PC running N5000 quad-core that I used for causal surfing. I have no issue using it for internet browsing and watching stream or video. For work wise like using Excel I would use a better processor like my E585 notebook. It will run faster.
I have three setup at home. Daily-use like internet surfing and you-know-what, I use my mini PC. Low powered. Thus can be 24x7. If gaming I turn on my desktop with ryzen 5 2400g. For mobility I uses my E585 notebook."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Icic.......
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I don't have the answer either, but my gut feel is that the Ryzen 3 is definitely faster even though it is missing 2 physical core to compete. Even though the Pentium Silver chips have 4 cores, they are typically limited to run at 10W, shared between the CPU and GPU. Assuming equal power rating, the Ryzen core will still be quite a bit faster, running alongside with a fairly powerful Vega 3 GPU. You can get a good indication by checking say an Intel i3 vs a Pentium Silver comparison."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Oh r u saying that a Ryzen 3 is as fast as an Intel i3?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ryzen 3 2200U is more or less faster than i3.
CPU is one aspect but the VEGA graphics is definitely better than Intel UHD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Icic.. thanks guys..
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hey, just updated to the latest version of Chrome 73.0.3683.75. That seems to solve the facebook and youtube video problems. No longer need to disable hardware acceleration or the ANGLE D3D9 workarounds."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I also suspected could be chrome issue not graphic driver.
For those who after update still encounter issue, suggest
reinstall Chrome from fresh."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Which is why I don't bother enabling hardware acceleration. I am one that don't update driver if its working fine for me. However Chrome updates automatically, which tends to break or cause issues from time to time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"True, same for me my Chrome the auto update is disabled.
I only update once a while or when there is a big version."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Guys ,
I'm thinking of getting a E585 / A485.
Want to customize it. So a few questions.
In A484 1st and 2nd hard disk are SSD. What's the difference between 2 SSD vs 1x Bigger capactity SSD?
Is A485 the better model and better wifi chips?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"A485 is the better model not only the WIFI, the chassis,
ports and etc. are are much better.
A485 also have docking port if you intend to get a docking station.
SSD wise recommended just get a m.2 SSD minimum 128GB for OS
will do.
No really recommended to get a big SSD for data storage, a HDD
will be much better over SSd."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ryzen3000 notebooks have started to appear in the market.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes but none in local stores.
Lenovo there are a few models and Asus FX505DY at the moment.
No Thinkpad based on the newer chip."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Just a heads up.. HP on LazMall is gonna have Lazada B'day Sale on 27 mar.. HP 14-cm0109au will be going for $4?4...
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I get a sense it will be 494.
In any case, it is already super good value t 499."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ya v wu hua... they had it at $499 $494 for a short while recently also.. r u getting anything on Lazada's bday sale on the 27th?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Latest GPU drivers are out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I guess this is the most value for money laptop now?
specs looks not bad for light use."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"E585 Silicone Keyboard protector in case anyone else needs:
And backlit keyboard:"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For now that is the only cheap, other options are:
Asus X505ZA $749 Ryzen 5. 256GB SSD, 4GB
Lenovo have four new Ideapad with Ryzen 3XXX series
The Ideapad L340 it is using 5400rpm HDD so I won't recommend it.
The C340 is a 2 in1 but that model is above $1k."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think the backlight of the keyboard works on the E485 and E585 even though it works on the E580 when the same keyboard is installed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I see. The description says for e585, but I havent tried myself. Those interested prob better to confirm with seller first."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"To be honest, I am not sure if a backlight keyboard is required for everyone. In the past when I need to see what I am typing, the backlight does help. Otherwise, I think it is just for aesthetics. I rather not have it and get a slightly better battery life for this laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I wonder why even at such a low price, this laptop doesn't enjoy gd sales... could it be bcos the majority of the general public would still rather stick to good old Intel chips?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,anyone received the Hp promotion laptop from lazada?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"1. design
2. weight"
Lenovo Thinkpad,still holding back due to the blue screen issue i read earlier in the page.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"this issue doesn't exist anymore.
at least for me.. with the latest gpu drivers"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I've been using it for close to 2 months now. No issues with BSOD to date.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Most folks out there that are not tech savvy will generally prefer Intel since AMD is unheard of to them. Moreover this deal is not widely available, i.e. you can't find it in stores, so unless you frequently comb through the ThinkPad series online, you may not notice it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This may be true since people nowadays will prefer a laptop that is paper thin. Design wise, you can't really ding them for the price."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, most will buy Intel over AMD.
Some have never heard of AMD especially those who are not into DIY.
But my two cents is that there is a bad perspective about AMD that it is hot and slow."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, and this group of people who are more tech savvy. But they feel to realized that the tide has turned and its now Intel that is running hot, especially the high end models. At the lower end and low power models, they are still doing well. This goes to show how hard they have pushed their aging chips just to keep up with competition."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"True;
Intel U series no issue especially with heat, however it's performance
especially the TDP still varies on manufacturer.
Intel H series wise this 45 watt CPU can reach 90 degrees on load
especially for i7/i9 6 core CPU are even hotter.
I am using Dell G3 i7 6 core, when gaming/load the laptop is like
a aeroplane. Waiting for a decent AMD Ryzen H gaming laptop
than I change.
As the first AMD Ryzen H gaming laptop, it is cited that AMD CPU
runs much cooler than Intel counterpart."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Oh lol i was actually talking abt the HP 14-cm0109au Ryzen 3 laptop..
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thinkpad E485 Review and they recommend it:
Sadly it seems the dual channel configuration Lenovo have removed it so not only SG.
The keyboard backlight, to me since it is E series such option not available.
Anyway not really useful unless you are typing in the dark.
If you can't see the keyboard, can always up the LCD brightness to illuminate the keyboard."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is this RAM option removed but still got 2 slots or new motherboard with single Sodimm ram slot? Ryzen can ran faster with dual chn.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Two slots.
Lenovo Thinkpad,2 slots should still be there. Normally they will not change the layout of the motherboard.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hi all I am looking to get a new laptop is the e585 a good buy? Laptop is for every day use such as surf net and watching video. Is there any major issues face by users who own this laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Very heavy. Thats all
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thx for reply. Weight shouldn't be a problem since I don't carry it around.
How about this model the ideal pad L340 when compare with the e585? the only difference I see is the hdd."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It will handle most tasks easily. Weight aside at approx 2.1 KG which is not heavy to me, it is getting more and more stable since its launch last year. I've been using the E485 which is essentially the same but with a smaller monitor, and its been very stable for me.
Compared to an Intel laptop of similar class/ build, this probably loses out in terms of battery life. But GPU is more than 2x if not 3x faster."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Despite it comes with the new AMD Ryzen mobile processor.
Thinkpad still wins hand down as:
- LCD panel the ideapad model comes with non-IPS panel
as compare with E585.
I owned Ideapad without IPS panel, the screen quality is poor.
- 5400rpm as primary HDD, Windows 10 will crawl
Laptop with SSD would be ideal to run Win 10.
Build, keyboard, trackpad Thinkpad is the better buy.
If you ask if there is E485/E585 refresh with the newer AMD mobile processor?
Unfortunately no news except T495/X395 but these are premium Thinkpad so will cost above $1k."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thx, it's good to know that it's getting stable. Is there any heat issues with the e485?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thx for the detail info. Looks like will give up this model. How about the IdeaPad s340 as compared to e585?
I read through the thread on t495/x395 it's coming out in June not sure if I am willing to wait that long cos my current laptop hdd is gone."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"What is your usage?
Work? Light gaming or?
Thinkpad E485/E585 still a better and balanced choice.
The next model would be E490 Intel but more expensive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Use mainly for surfing and watching video online. Might use it for some light gaming if got time.
Looking to find one that can last 4-5 yrs cos I don't change pc very fast."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"E485/E585 fits your usage, opt for three years warranty than
you are good to go.
Unless you have bigger budget than go for T series,
Intel U series with MX150.
Else the E490 which I shared, pricey but that is if you prefer Intel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyone knows the speed or lanes of both the pcie interface for E485/585? I can only see on A485 which states Gen3 x2, aka 16Gbs/s."
Lenovo Thinkpad,For m.2 slot?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yup, just wanted to make sure not buying any higher speed nvme that will be bottled neck by the pcie speed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,For A485 is 16GB/S according to Lenovo.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"There is no reason to limit what SSD to get just because it can't run at full speed. The reality is that most high speed NVMe drive can never sustain full speed even if it is not bandwidth limited, especially one in a laptop. Also based on your own usage, will you consistently make it run at full speed?
With SSD prices currently very affordable, I doubt you will save much from buying a NVMe drive that runs at PCIEx2 vs x4."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"you actually do, e.g. Crucial P1 1TB ~$105 USD vs Samsung Evo Plus 1TB $250 USD. So if the latter is crippled by the interface bandwidth, no point spending on it right..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think it is not a good comparison when you are choosing one of the lowest end SSD vs a top end SSD. There are SSDs that don't come with a steep Samsung premium.
If I look at the pricing for Crucial P1 on Amazon Prime, its going around 144 bucks. While if you look at Lazada, you can find 1TB NVMe drives for close to 200 bucks before any discounts applied. For example, if you look up Transcend MTE220S 1TB, its 199 bucks before rebates and coupon discounts."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"bought this for my dad at $629 with the 72 hour coupon
Comes with the latest ryzen 5 3500u processor, downside for this model is you don't have the option to change to ssd, but it's fine, after the 1 year warranty i will swap the hard disk to ssd if needed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,You can add a m.2 SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,I believe no issue to add on with another 8gb ram? Price is really attractive for latest Ryzen 3000.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, one soldered and one slot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,This is great pricing. And its quite rare to see laptops with ODD nowadays.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The other disadvantage about the L340 other than HDD.
Is the display, take note the LCD panel is not IPS.
So expect average picture quality."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For the T490..the 8gb ram is soldered on.
What if I add another 8gb ram will it be faster or more efficient?
Is 1 stick 16GB ram good? Don't know why lenovo don't offer 2x8Gb.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Depends on your usage I guess.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"wah, Ryzen 5 + 8GB at below $700 is a value buy. Yr dad can play games with this system."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi guys,
Just want to clarify
Q1 What kind of battery life are you getting with the E485 and E585? Usage am looking at is mainly surfing, playing videos via vlc, coding and using spreadsheets, word processing.
Q2 If let's say the battery life is only 4 hours with the above scenario, is it possible to use a USB PowerDelivery powerbank when on the go? If so what powerbanks would you recommend?
Q3 Would it be better to wait for the newer ryzen 3000 mobile for battery life? See some info putting it at 12 hours spec"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you want longer battery life, consider A485 as that model the
battery can swap out.
If battery exhausted can just snap in a new one.
Powerbank for such laptop, normal powerbank are not usable.
You need this type of charger.

It's pricey but if you get cheap and not compatible powerbank.
You may risk damaging the laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I can't find any review of Ryzen 3000 mobile notebooks to date, though someone has recently compared gaming performance between Ryzen 2500U & the 3500U on YouTube.
The FPS gain is at most 10%.
Ryzen 3000 improvements from the 12nm node possibly slightly lower cache latency, +100mhz base & 100-200mhz Max boost, some power savings.
Hopefully the high idle power consumption of the Ryzen 2000 mobile has been alleviated partially with the 12nm node.
I say partially cos it will probably take more than a half node shrink to fix high idle power consumption.
Intel just have much more experience in minimizing CPU idle power consumption over the years.
OEMs generally over-quote laptop battery life.
If I were to hazard a guess, a 6 hours practical battery life given the same battery capacity. ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thinkpad E495/E595 have been announced.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"These are the specs I choose for either e485/e585
AMD Ryzen 7 2700U Processor 6MB Cache, up to 3.80GHz
14""/15.6"" FHD 1920x1080, IPS, Anti-glare
8GB DDR4 2400MHz SODIMM
AMD Radeon RX Vega 10 Graphics
500GB Hard Disk Drive, 7200RPM, 2.5"", SATA3
256GB Solid State Drive, M.2 2280, NVMe, Opal 2.0
Is this alright? What's your recommendation?
Are there any big difference between the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"2700U only have 200 more mhz in Base & Boost clocks respectively.
It also has faster integrated graphics.
Besides these 2 factors, they share the exact feature set.
2700U vs 2500u makes a small difference in games Say 10-15%. In non-gaming usage CPU intensive, the difference is single digit.
Just make sure that the 8GB is 2 sticks dual channel.
Imho, 12-16GB dual channel is better as 8gb is really the bare minimum nowadays.
And having memory in Dual channel makes a big difference for Ryzens."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"On paper, Ryzen 7 is faster, i.e. CPU with higher clockspeed and more beefy GPU. In reality when both CPU and GPU are under load, both Ryzen 5 and 7 will throttle due to insufficient power and in most cases, a lack of cooling as well. These ultra low power CPU are rated at 15W and is able to boost temporarily to 25W. That's not a lot of power to share between the CPU and GPU. The situation is the same for Intel's ultra low power chips."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Good to go.
Between 5 and 7 is the clockspeed.
Remember to buy additional ram for the laptop to take advantage of the dual channel which benefit the Ryzen APU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,In what cases will both CPU and GPU be under load? What can be done to stop the throttle due to insufficient power?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thx guys. Will it be better if I change the 8GB ram to a 12GB 4+8 DDR4 2400MHz SoDIMM?
If the E495/E595 is coming out soon it could be better to wait for these two models?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It's a minor improvement slightly faster, better idle power draw.
Not sure if Lenovo will be changing other hardware components on the E495/E595.
The new ideaPad with Ryzen 3xxx are already out for online order.
However, no customization is allowed & the default configuration is lacking on those."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Might as well wait awhile more.
Since it's already appearing the newer models."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I use this xiaomi pd powerbank for Macbook and my Friend use it for his ThinkPad. Cheap and works extremely well. Was previously using Anker 30W 26.8k Mah powerbank.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"True but pricing maybe different.
Older model will be cheap while newer can be more expensive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually not insufficient power but the TDP limitation.
Since AMD Ryzen 2500U is ultra low wattage with TDP set at
15 watt minimum while the max is 25 watt.
Under load like games, 3D application and etc. than the turbo
will kick in than the APU TDP will rise to 25 watt.
Not sure in the BIOS whether the AMD SenseMI can be disable
or not.
Intel is Intel Speedstep while AMD is SenseMI
However even if it is possible, it will impact performance.
Best to leave it on."
Lenovo Thinkpad,skipping the new 495/595 since this is just zen+..not even zen2
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Gaming, which is also one of the main reasons to choose a APU over a CPU. Depends on the manufacturer, some allow you to turn the TDP up for Intel, not sure for AMD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you need a laptop soon, then personally I don't see the need to wait. The 3xxx series is not going to be a game changer in terms of performance as compared to the current 2xxx series."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Most manufacturers will not allow you to tamper with the TDP, especially on a laptop. The reason is because the cooling solution for a laptop is made for the TDP that they set. By allowing for a permanent TDP increase by user means it may overheat. There may be ways to do it, but definitely not something that is covered under warranty.
So far, I've only seen those smaller China manufacturers such as Chuwi, Oanda, Cube, etc, allowing users to increase the TDP."
Lenovo Thinkpad,That is true.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thx all for the helpful advice.
Is the 12GB 4+8 DDR4 2400MHz SoDIMM consider a 2 sticks ram dual channel?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Better avoid such combination.
Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Avoid this configuration, different size the RAM won't perform very well.
Worse performance may hit or crash.
Just get 8GB than when you get the laptop than add another stick.
Don't know why Lenovo had to remove the RAM combo option."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thx would have gone for that configuration.
Yes it would be great if they have the ram combo option.
Any recommendations where I can get another stick?
Have never add ram myself before hope it's not too hard."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thks for all the replies guys.
Glad to have got confirmation about the usb pd powerbank notion.
For battery life we can use a scaling factor just to estimate. If recall correctly, lenovo specs a 9hr battery life, user reviews puts it approx 4.5 hrs.. So a 50% factor may be a good starting estimate. The new spec for the e495 puts it at 13hrs... so hopefully this translates to at least 6.5hours..
As for dual channel ram, there seems to be a bit of mix advice going on here... So if we spec a single 8gb ram, how should we source the next 8gb ram? Same brand? Or is it better to just order the 4gb ram, sell it & then buy 2 x 8Gb ram?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Doubt anyone will want to buy 4GB, the resale for such size is very little.
Best would be 8GB than get another stick, brand wise need not be the same
but the size, specs and speed must be the same.
Can get from SLS or Lazada Convergent Store:"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It will run in Flex mode. 4gb + 4gb in dual channel & the last 4gb in the bigger stick in single channel.
If the 12 GB 8+4 configuration is provided straight from Lenovo, there won't be any compatibility issues
Ideally, matched sticks same size & same memory chips is still better.
If you use 2 unmatched sticks of RAM eg: 8gb from Lenovo, 8GB from elsewhere, there is a small chance of it not running in Dual channel. In the worse case scenario, it may also have bootup issue.
Memory compatibility for AMD is generally not as good as Intel.
To play safe & save money, get the minimum 4GB option & buy 2x8GB or 2x16GB Matched pair separately from other online retailers to upgrade yourself.
Of cos, the 4GB stick will have little to no resale value."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can I ask, how's the Ubuntu or other Linux distro compatibility with AMD chips? Been thinking of getting an affordable thinkpad to run Ubuntu
Posted from PCWX using Mi A2"
Lenovo Thinkpad,any thoughts on the ryzen5 lenovo yoga 530?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Some modification to Grub is required for Linux to boot without errors..
Btw, how's the battery life of your Mi A2?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Got another E485 for my frd...Really cheap and good buy...
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks! will look through the links.
The A2, it's currently running 2 active SIM card and got it during 2018's Black Friday. Morning 7am 100% till 3pm is about 10-20%. For me I'm satisfied as it's a budget mid-range phone. performance is starting to show slow-ness. Might reset it soon."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"guys.. those who did a clean install of windows, how do you get office installed again??"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can download the installer from MS Office website.
There is 365 and the Office 2019.
Older version of Officer MS website should have them."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I just got my E585, on stock paste with 1.52 BIOS the CPU do not go beyond 80C with a room temperature of around 29C.
This is only with a CPU load and not a combined CPU/GPU load.
Seems like the BIOS throttles the CPU once it reaches 80C."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"How is the performance of E585?
Saw reviews in Lenovo website, someone feedback this notebook is slow even with SSD option."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for sharing. I believe CPU will drop to base clock if not lower when it hits 80 to 82 degs. Even with combined CPU/GPU load, it will throttle heavily due to TDP constraint."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The notebook is not slow with the SSD M2 NVME option.
I got a Samsung PM981 in mine but components can change based on Lenovo's whim.
On A/C power, it's slightly faster than my old i7-3770 desktop from 2012 in CPU-Z single & multiple threaded benchmarks.
They are almost 7 years apart in age, but one must also consider the 77W TDP of the i7 desktop to the 15W TDP of the Ryzen 2500U.
When running on battery, Ryzen is much slower.
I need to dig my screen-shots to compare A/C power & battery only performance.
Overall, it's pretty good for the price, but road warrior it definitely is not, as it runs out of battery power within 4.5-5 hours."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I've been using the E485 for few months now. While its slower when booting up as compared to my full fledged desktop, it is not unexpected since we are looking at a 15W vs 95W CPU. Once it is fully boot up, I never really felt that it is slow."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Usually laptop that are ship, the preload OS comes with bloatware.
If you know how to fresh install than do a clean install.
Speed will vastly improve over factory image that is loaded onto the laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If I choose SSD M2 NVME option, could I add on another 2TB hardisk later? I need big storage.
Does it come with normal hardisk cage if I choose SSD option?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually, the laptop have relatively few bloatware pre-installed.
The main ones I have seen so far:
1 MS Office 2016 trial from MS Store
2 Mcafee Total Protection 30 days trial
3 Lenovo Vantage & other Lenovo tools which are useful
All of these can be uninstalled."
Lenovo Thinkpad,E485 & E585 comes with the cage & SATA cable.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I agree. Across most of the laptop brands I have used, I get the least bloatware on the ThinkPad E485. The other one that came with no bloatware at all was from Aftershock."
Lenovo Thinkpad,will it recognize the free 1 year subscription for office 365?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you have subscribed to Office 365, you should be able to log in and download Office to your desktop/ laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am considering to get this laptop.
Should I wait for PC show which held next month?
Hoping for more discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Is this laptop available from the shop? The delivery date from Lenovo is 2 week, kinda long."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you are not in a rush, no harm waiting. But based on my observation, PC Show or not is unlikely to impact pricing. If you are thinking of looking for it at the show, I believe it cost more."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you are in a rush, then may not be suitable for you. While I received it in less than 2 weeks, delivery time line can be impacted by many factors."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Looks like Lenovo is clearing stock for the upcoming E495/E595.
Labour day promo is on now @ 25% off for both models.
https://www.lenovo.com/sg/en/deals/special-offer/"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is aftershock laptop good? I am considering getting the forge 15.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is it the lowest price so far? Should I wait till PC show?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lowest price so far outside of the Education discount 25% vs $300 discount.
Maybe by PC Show in June, they will sell the new models liao."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Also depends on desired config. Lowest ever for 16GB RAM config was probably with night promo code and free RAM upgrade some months back. But just a matter of a few ten of dollars even if you want to try to catch the bottom? lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeah, Lenovo UK already listed new ones not for sale yet though."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Pretty good. Bought a mx15 for my son.
Lenovo Thinkpad,How to get the education discount?
Lenovo Thinkpad,The new model E495 is now available to order from Lenovo SG website.
Lenovo Thinkpad,The new E495 wireless card is using Intel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Some observations
- The 3yr onsite warranty upgrade is no longer 0.01 but S$145.
- For the e495 there is mention of black & silver colour, though don't quite see where to select the option"
Lenovo Thinkpad,The E495 WiFi is 2x2 MiMO compared to E485 1x1 so WiFi connectivity should be better on E495
Lenovo Thinkpad,Strange that the Ex95 psref states no USB3 gen2 port while the Ex85 have them.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeah, I just noticed that. What makes this laptop so attractive to me is the 3 years onsite warranty.
In fact over the last couple of months, I also noticed that the base prices have been increasing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi there, I got an Lenovo ideapads145 with A9425 chip, can it be upgraded to Ryzen r5 1600x diy? Advice needed!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyone compare the spec between Ideapad 330s and thinkpad e585?
It seems 330s is using i7 processor. The downside is ideapad 330s<$1k model is using normal hardisk."
Lenovo Thinkpad,No........
Lenovo Thinkpad,The price for e495 is not that bad. 3500u 16 gb and 256 SSD. Around 961.
Lenovo Thinkpad,It's not 0.01 but a dollar now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yup, great that the steep upgrade pricing lasted only a day or so...
Anyway e595 is listed for sale now. No upgrade options available yet. Likely in the process of updating"
Lenovo Thinkpad,e595 options available now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The APU is soldered to the mainboard so cannot be upgraded.
Best to get a new laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"price are creeping up. Used to be 660, after Ryzen 3Gen  come, 740."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Price have indeed been creeping upwards. As for the newer models, I guess it is not unexpected for them to charge more since its new. I also recalled someone mentioned that it comes with a better wifi card."
Lenovo Thinkpad,config shows a intel 9260 installed. but still no backlit kb
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Apparently the E495/E595 supports DDR4 2666MHz memory.
I just downloaded the Option Compatibility matrix from this page:
So the differences so far at least for Singapore market
1 Slightly faster CPU Ryzen+ 12nm
2
Edited 8 May Supports DDR4 2666MHz memory, but Lenovo still sells with DDR4 2400mhz
3 Improved battery life From 12nm process & possibly better optimised firmware/BIOS
4 Better Wifi card Intel AC9260 2x2"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"if you are not in need of a ryzen laptop, advisable to skip till next year iteration where it will be true 7nm.
this is just zen+"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Memory wise, according to spec sheet.
DDR4 2666MHZ install will run at 2400mhz."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is E585 or E595 a better purchase and what are the difference in price and specs?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"At this point in time.. if you are getting. get the newer version.
imo la."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"E585 AMD Ryzen 7 2700U Processor 6MB Cache, up to 3.80GHz
E595 AMD Ryzen 5 3500U Processor 4MB Cache, up to 3.60GHz
Which processor is better?
It seems E585 has faster and larger cache CPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"In case anyone getting the newer ones, use ANNIVERSARY15 as the coupon code, u'll get 15% as compared to other codes which is ~10% off only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,You can choose ryzen 7 for e595 also.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Depend on your budget, if you want to save than older model E585.
E595 at this time it is pricey than E585 but the APU is newer
as well as WLAN is using Intel AC than previous Qualcomm."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"They have exactly the same amount of cache 2MB L2 & 4MB L3.
Lenovo just use different ways of calculating it.
2700U or 3700U cpu is not worth it IMHO due to the steep price increase over 2500U or 3500U.
Likewise, the price difference is small between both models, just go for the newer model."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Regardless of AMD or Intel, there is very little reason to pay more for the higher end Ryzen 7 or Core i7 ultra low voltage processors, i.e 15W TDP. Most reviews have shown that if both the CPU and GPU are taxed simultaneously, they generally perform no better than their lower end Ryzen 5 or Core i5 counterparts because 1TDP is capped, and 2Cooling solution is generally customized for the TDP. There are rare cases where I've seen the higher end CPU making a difference, and in almost every case, its because they are running a discrete graphic card and better cooling."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I've not been checking the price, but if the price difference is not that great, then go for the newer version."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This is questionable. 12nm is nothing but a tweaked + more matured 14nm. So while it will certainly become more efficient, I suspect the increase in clockspeed over the older chips will nullify the potential improvement to battery life."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If we ignore the Boost clockspeeds, base clockspeed increase is minimum, just 100mhz for both 3500U & 3700U.
So I suspect that they focused on maintaining or lowering the power consumption instead.
Also the high idle power consumption may be improved in this iteration via other means such as further platform optimization & hardware bug fixes.
As of now, AMD's 2018 Raven Ridge @14nm is not even on par with Intel 2014 Haswell @22nm in terms of idle power consumption.
AMD has a lot of catching up to do in this aspect of mobile computing.
It's something which Intel has a lot more experience in."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Even though I agree, take note that Intel NB chips the onboard graphic
isn't that as fast/powerful as compare with AMD Vega.
If power were to go down than the onboard Vega performance will also be hamper.
These chips are not just CPU but they also have IGP with it on the same die."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For those looking at budget laptop, the upcoming Lenovo T495/T495S/X395/X395S will definitely be out of your league.

Pricing will be above $1k depending on specs.
AMD Ryzen APU Thinkpad the advantage would be one chip
to rule them all.
Unlike Intel based laptop if you need better graphic than
have to opt for optional Nvidia graphics which cost more.
Downside I think most will agree is that AMD Ryzen APU
battery time isn't that as good with Intel.
Since Ryzen APU packs a powerful CPU and GPU on one die."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Does that mean E595 is a good buy
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Should this be more or less the best price around le? I don't mind waiting for any IT show or what, because this will be a backup for work at home.
Sent from Xiaomi POCOPHONE F1 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,let's wait for a proper review on E495. Tempted to get one! Let's see the battery life first
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Am a little tempted to get a x240. Ya I know its freaking old model. Saw online selling refurbished set at around $250 with the usual shop warranty one month. But I have no experience handling preown laptops. I am worried what if the previous owners installed some spyware inside then I use kena...

Coincidentally saw audiohouse posted this. Same x240, selling $369. Tempted if they throw in any promo to reduce further...
Sent from Xiaomi POCOPHONE F1 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Do a SSD or HDD Secure Delete, then install new Windows or Linux OS.
X240 is okay, personally I just hate it's clicky Touchpad... the x40 series touchpads are the worst in Thinkpads.
If you are comfortable opening the laptop to do maintenance changing thermal paste, adding RAM or storage drive, 2nd hand laptops are fine.
Just don't expect good battery life from an old refurnished laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Is this with the education discount?
If yes, don't need to consider much, can hoot liao."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Refurbished sets after secure delete, how to install windows again ah??? Paiseh ah, sorry for the noobness...
Because I likely will be streaming videos from YouTube or China websites, internet surfing, sometimes work on words or excel work files nia. Shouldn't be considered heavy-duty bah I suppose?
Sent from Xiaomi POCOPHONE F1 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For me, I use PartedMagic.
Usually refurnished sets comes with Windows 7 OEM anyway, so it's good to install a newer OS anyway.
If you plan to use Windows 10, you have to take the OS cost into account as well.
One advantage of an old ThinkPad... Linux compatibility is usually excellent."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If the refurbished set is installed with Windows 10 liao. When I do a wipeout, the Windows 10 os automically be there or I have to do some installation work? I reading online says it's quite effortless click, reformat, wait, it will reboot back with the same Windows 10 but clean empty. Because I getting from those SLS shop, the seller claims he can install office 365 foc for me. But if I secure delete, the foc office 365 will be gone also right?
Sent from Xiaomi POCOPHONE F1 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It depends on how through you want it to be.
Reset this PC function in win 10 may be good enough for your purpose."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone know which shop is selling below Lenovo website retail price?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is E595 OK for light gaming? Such as maplestory runescape
Lenovo Thinkpad,what discount is this? can we apply too?
Lenovo Thinkpad,It should be able to run.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"To reinstall Windows 10, you just need to download the Windows media creation tool and create a boot disk to perform a clean installation. If the laptop comes with an activated Windows 10 previously, then you do not have to bother about entering any keys.
For FOC Office 365, I suspect it is only a 1 month trial."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Think we need a new thread for E495/E595 soon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I let someone create, someone other than me to do it else I maybe suspect as AMD promoter."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Is it any worth to wait for cee show two weeks later?
Sent from Xiaomi POCOPHONE F1 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not worth, Lenovo online deal are more worth it.
Not to mention CEE show models usually are pre-configured so
you can customized it.
Example ram maybe it came with 1 X 8 GB ram."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"seems like latest may AMD drivers fixed the black screen for video playback in chrome!
edit: seems like not really but like much less frequent"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"try updating chrome.
chrome problem.
i remember if u disable something chrome won't have this problem.
think is hardware acceleration or something."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"ask promo from cso. Gives 15% off retail price
$961 with 16gb ram, 512gb ssd, 3500u. 3 years onsite warranty. Damn worth it
Purchased one already, waiting for shipping
shopback additional 7% not sure if will get approved"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"wah, fully loaded, Ryzen5+16gb dual ram = can play game and watch youtube simultaneous."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Good price.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"dont have high expectation for games. Kinda using it for work, hope that the linux support will be good.
The good thing is that this laptop got one pcie and one sata3 port. Means can put in two disc drive!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Do let us know your impression of the laptop when you get it.
I have the E585 & I can barely get more 3.5 hours out of it unplugged 2500U, 16GB ram + additional SATA SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The only difference between E495 & E595 is LCD screen size?
Both come with black color option only?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, black only weridly the pic show silver which means maybe later time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ya. The picture looks like silver. Prefer black. Classic
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thinkpad only available online? Cannot find ThinkPad in CEE Lenovo bronchure.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thinkpad is business line, it won't be feature in IT show.
Ideapad and Legion consumer line than yes."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I did see some thinkpad on sale, but not sure but it's retailers like Challenger, Courts. Not wide selection though
Sent from Xiaomi POCOPHONE F1 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"True, the configuration are fix so can't customize.
Mostly are Intel models so for AMD based have to order online."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wooo! Just got the e595 I like how you can customize it. Didn't know this was available before. Last I bought a laptop was 4 yrs ago. Which other manufacturer let you customize too?
I think this deal is quite good."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just realized they changed to 495/595 liao

Lenovo Thinkpad,ya the newer models.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Any better/similar value notebook in the market besides lenovo e series?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Sadly none, those lappy with Intel CPU.
The iGP isn't that great as Vega graphics."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hopefully more manufacturers adopt amd cpu lo
Sent from Sony H8166 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually have but most of them are not here in SG.
Lenovo seems the only one brining them here.
- HP a few models but very pricey
- Asus their new Ryzen gaming line not sure when arrive
- Dell not bringing them here
Since the refresh model is here, so existing model most likely
they will clear off."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Was shopping around for a friend and found
After coupons, cart and etc is approximately below $950
How is this comparable with E495?
It has backlit keyboard not that it matters, longer battery stamina, lighter by at least 250grams to my friend it matters alot and my last e485 the weight on lenovo is not accurate it is heavier than what was advertised, thin bezel.. mx150"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Depend on your preference but Thinkpad build and keyboard is better.
Since you owned the e485 than if you feel swift is better than that
just get it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Dis you get additional 15% from 961?
Or 961 is after discount?
Sent from HUAWEI ELE-L29 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This looks very tempting! New to thinkpad here, can't seem to find many reviews on this e495 though.. Is it a new model?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,New model reviews usually won't be out so soon maybe within 6 months.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Does the E485/ E495 support the regular 45W charger? I was thinking of getting the Xiaomi 45 W changer and the Powerbank with USB PD 45W.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It works with the Xiaomi 45W Type C charger, but not sure about the powerbank."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Just bought a set. Any lobang to get a 1tb sata 3 ssd?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You can either check on Lazada for say a 1TB Transcend SSD or check on Amazon Prime Now. You should be able to get 1TB for around 150 bucks after discount on Lazada, or on Prime Now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I agree keyboard is better on the ThinkPad. Build wise, it really depends since the E series is really the budget series, while the Swift 3 is not really that budget based on their price. My sister is using Swift 3 and I think the build is better. Only downside about the Swift 3 I believe is the fact that you don't get much upgrade option since the memory is soldered. In this case, the ThinkPad E series is more versatile since we can add more RAM and have a secondary drive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I don't think there is anything significantly different between this and the older E485. Look up for reviews for E485 and you should get a reasonably close review of the E495. You should see slight improvements with performance, and better WIFI performance depends if Lenovo uses Intel wireless card."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thinkpad has many series. Seems L series A series and E series around $1k. Which series more value for money?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"E series, E495/E595 are the best value for now. A series will be under T series very soon so that series pricing may drop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not to mention improved battery life, due to the 12nm CPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I feel we may not see much of an improvement in this area. 12nm is actually a refined 14nm, which is basically the same as Intel's branding of 14nm+. So the improvement is not going to be significant. If AMD maintained the clockspeed, we may see an improvement in efficiency, but since they bumped up both the CPU and GPU speed, it will nullify any improvements to battery life."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks Watzup_ken and Techidiot for the advise. Will check out the e485 before I make a decision!
Lenovo Thinkpad,That is good to know. I thinking of getting a compactUSB Type Charger so that I can travel without having too many chargers if I getting this laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I'm considering between E495 and Vivobook S14. For those using the E485, are your laptop lasting?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thinkpad - Business
Vivobook - Consumer
The choice is definetely Thinkpad, since it is meant for business so
durability would be better than consumer grade laptop.
I have stop supporting Asus, their service center is a let down.
Don't forget Thinkpad you can opt for onsite warranty, anything
can call so need to bring down for servicing like Asus laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Considering E495 and C340 AMD.
C340 is paying premium for the ability to convert and touchscreen?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"We will need to wait for more reviews to confirm.
But in the full review of a 35W Picasso 12nm laptop with discrete graphics link below, the idle power consumption is much lower than all Raven Ridge 14nm laptops.
Apparently, there was some issue with higher idle power consumption which is fixed in the Picasso 12nm CPUs.
Also AMD only raise the clockspeeds a little 5%- <10%."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"AMD Ryzen 5 3500U Processor 4MB Cache, up to 3.60GHz
AMD Ryzen 7 3700U Processor 4MB Cache, up to 3.80GHz
Price difference is $130. Most of the buyers here choose Ryzen 5 or 7?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ryen 5 will do fine for normal usage.
Unless you intend to game than get the Ryzen 7."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"But integrated graphics right?
Noob question, I don't game but mostly use it fir work where I open multiple chrome tabs 30-40 and YouTube. Does integrated graphics work good enough or can it be changed myself otherwise?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you need to open 30 to 40 tabs of chrome, I think RAM must have at least 8GB.
My house laptop has dedicated graphic card. My office laptop using integrated graphic card. I cannot detect any difference via watching YouTube."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You need lots of RAM for this, the Ryzen IGPU is superior than Intel
HD so graphic power wise it is decent enough without need
for dedicated graphics like MX150/MX250."
Lenovo Thinkpad,打PUBG吃雞，雷神5可以啦！
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Did anyone bought the C340 $899 model? It is a good deal after 15% discount and 9% shopback. It also come with 3 years on site warranty.
But the delivery is in Oct'19. Is it the norm? First time, I bought from Lenovo online site."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks for your recommendation. Decided on the E495. Onsite warranty is really useful and it's 3 years compare to 2 years for other brands.
Lenovo Thinkpad,如果E595内部與585一樣沒什麽改變的話。。。https://little-beans.net/howto/thinkpad-e580-parts/。。。這樣提升内存應該方便吼？
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi All,
Which laptop to choose based on your hands on experience?
1 E495
2 E595
3 A485"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"E series definitely.
The A series will be refresh soon so best skip.
Between 4 or 5, take note of the size.
595 is bigger and heavier than 495.
If you want portability than 495 will do fine."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"E series more plastic?
A series is aluminium?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"E series E485/495 is mostly metal case for the display frame.
The other half Keyboard/palmrest area is all plastic.
No idea about A series.
A485 seems to have weaker cooling than the E series, though this may have been alleviated in newer BIOS versions."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hey guys,
E495 battery life is around 3h ?????????? freaking cui... i really suggest you guys buy something else if you need a long battery life"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You got your E495 already?
I have a E595, it's about the same if not worse.
Besides battery life, it's still a pretty good laptop.
Try switching from the Ryzen optimised power plan to Windows Balanced power plan.
Apparently the Ryzen optimised power plan is obsolete in Windows 10 build 1809."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The A series which I know is really focused on portability, i.e. small and light. Therefore the cooling solution is weaker. For example, you are likely to see 1 heatpipe vs 2 heatpipes when comparing A and E series laptops."
Lenovo Thinkpad,yes it is that chui. hence i got myself the acer swift instead.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"While I agree if battery life is a priority then better to look elsewhere, we do have to account for the fact that it is a ThinkPad at sub 1k price tag. Typically budget series laptop comes with budget battery capacity as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Worth to get T495 over E495?
Lenovo Thinkpad,under 1k i don't really expect the rest of the other brands to last significantly longer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,there are - depends on what you want.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If battery life is important, get the regular Intel based E490 lor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Really depends especially budget as T495 will cost twice depending
on the configuration.
Advantage over E are:
- Option for better panel
- WWAN included
- Onboard 8GB ram
- Better chassis and build than E
- Docking port.
T495 with Ryzen 7 with best configuration will cost near $2k.
Like others mention if battery is a concern than get Intel based."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"How is your usage? Gaming?
According to Lenovo spec, it can last for 13 hours for video playback."
Lenovo Thinkpad,what do you recommend?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"That depends what is more important that u need.
If battery life is a concern, go get the Swift 3.
The Swift 3 with HD Graphics and i5 - cost u less than $900 over at Qoo10.
It is 1.45KG, with backlit keyboard, longer battery stamina and nice metallic thin 3 sided bezel, modern looking case + the Fn key is in the inside not the outside
If u top up alittle more to get the 1 with MX150/250 @ 1298-1398 before discount - if u play your card rights - it should be below 1k or close to 1k.
Currently Qoo10 has 15% off with AMEX for QCoins.
Acer - Qoo10 also have $30
U can wait for the next 100 off 1000 or 40/50 off 300 etc coupons to bring it further south.
However, if onsite warranty is a concern because you buy a laptop and expect it to break multiple times - go for Lenovo with 10 years ago battery life but ""better"" durability and almost 500g heavier in weight. Also, the Vega10 is pretty decent compared to the pathetic Intel HD. Maybe to some, 500grams is nothing - note that i have to carry alot of other stuffs and not just the laptop. any potential weight savings is a huge welcome.
Note: I am comparing with Ryzen 7 vs i5-8265 the 8265 is on par with Ryzen 7 - scores based on
In other words, i feel the Acer Swift 3 is more value for money than Lenovo. Lenovo used to be more attractive however the recent surge in pricing doesn't do justice to it any longer."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Basically:
- Longer battery = Intel based laptop
- Better Graphics = AMD Ryzen based laptop
Intel HD is crappy as compare with Vega graphics.
Probably also Intel HD graphic consume less power than Vega.
Overall battery time on Intel would be better."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You comparison link is to a i7?
do you have the link? cause i can't find the swift 3 with similar specs to the one a guy bought recently e495."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ryzen 7 vs i5.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Probably on airplane mode, single channel memory, 2.5 inch drive bay not utilized, and with the 720pnon-HD display.
And at 50% or lower brightness.
Basically with unrealistic settings lah."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"note this model comes with Nvidia MX250, PCIe SSD...
only with Shop, Cart and Gift Card.. without the 15% already from 1398 > 1069
And without riding on the AMEX 15%."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Whatever Lenovo claimed 13 hours...its probably theoretical ...
Take it with a handful of salt... if you can get 6 hours ... very good already..
Trust me... I used Lenovo laptop before.
Whatever operation hours they say.... simply divide by factor of 2."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"when i click in to see. is a i7
Intel Core i7-8565U"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Other than the graphics,battery life
i still think lenovo thinkpad is a better choice.
16gb and 512 ssd."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Quite true, most over declared... Divide by 2 you should be near...at this weight and pricing, I am happy with 4 hours or so if battery life.. Enough for half day worth of work."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i would rather purchase thinkpad over acer anytime LOL...... anyway i just purchased a xiaomi powerbank
this will at least increases the battery life"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lol? U can always swap this yourself. If you include all of it the prices is going to be higher than value for money dude
Btw, is sgd1071.30 for whatever you've thrown in.
Ryzen 3700u
16GB
512GB
Laptop, most important parts are GPU and CPU. These are the two you cannot change. Ram and SSd are the least of anyone's concern. At least for mine, that is.
Anyway, as long u feel good, e495 is good however definitely not VFM"
Lenovo Thinkpad,So instead of 1.8kg now need to add weight for the battery as well. Anyway i am just sharing my opinion and thoughts. Might be useful for others. Not so much for thinkpad die hard fans
Lenovo Thinkpad,which laptop is VFM?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I just got the E595 and tested that on first charge, the battery can last over 4hours no issue with screen brightness set to maximum. I think pretty sure can last for 6 to 7 hours of usage normally with screen brightness to maximum, Surf net, run cpu, gpu, hard disk crystaldiskmark and geekbench 4 benchmark.
I did not get Ryzen 3700u as I choose 3500u as one hundred over include 15% off does not give me 10% faster performance, I would say too little performance increase not worth it. Vega 8 integrated graphics benchmark is 11% higher than Vega 10 graphics so is a minus point for Ryzen 3700u CPU build in graphics as I google it do not know how true is that.
I open up the back cover very easy, just unscrew all the back cover, then ply open slowly from the top where the hot air vent is one by one got clip not to use too much force to break the clip, it should come out easy the whole piece. I remove the 4GB DDR4 2600mhz installed default, put in 2X16GB ram DDR4 2400mhz ripsaw CL16 brought online overseas from Newegg free shipping here for S$185.
My laptop brought online from Lenovo SG website include SSD M2 512GB, FHD screen, 65W power charger upgrade, plus 3 years onsite warranty, Lenovo bag and wireless mouse cost 842.8 Singapore dollars quite worth it. The laptop is not too heavy, to replace my Sony 15inch laptop purchase in End Sep 2012 which is a bit heavy and bigger."
Lenovo Thinkpad,The m2 is using half size 2242 got extension holder. Tonight I try on my hard disk M2 2280 size I think can fit in directly without the extension holder maybe? Also empty box for the normal 2.5inch hdd or SSD Sata drive can put as secondary drive.
Lenovo Thinkpad,this can work on the e595?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You're right.. the extra cash for the 3700 is not worth it.. just a slight performance increase.
3500 is better"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think if xiaomi can support usb c PD 45W charging as what it mention by the lazada seller in Question and answer, this e595 should work as default charger is 45w unless you pay extra for upgrade."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I got the xm pb from here
Can charge my ThinkPad laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am able to fit in 2280 M2 SSD well, weight is almost 1.9kg, a hundred over gram more that what Lenovo stated 1.75kg, with dummy HDD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks for unbiased feedback. Dont mind i ask what is brand for the default memory and sdd included?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"just tried with the xiaomi gen 3 powerbank. yup it works, can charge!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"the default ram brand is ramaxel for 4GB size one piece shipped, never heard of this brand.
SSD brand for my 512gb upgraded shipped is WD brand PC SN520 model."
Lenovo Thinkpad,OEM brand ram which are not sold separately at retail shops.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Comes with sk hynix pcie ssd .
I open up the laptop and added an cruical mx500 500gb cost $94 on carousell. Using it for dual boot, ubuntu on the sata3 ssd and windows on the pcie m2 slot
Total cost if shopback approve is
$961*0.93 + $94  = $987.73
Ryzen 3500u
fhd screen
16gb ram
500gb pcie ssd
500gb sata 3 ssd
3 years onsite warranty.
I guess it's acceptable for the price i paid vs the battery life.
This is thinkpad we are talking, not Ideapad, not acer. Even though it's the lower end series, it's still a thinkpad"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I have received Ideapad C340 laptop. It is a good buy around $700 with 15% discount and 9% rebate from shopback. It is a 2 in 1 laptop with touchscreen with active pen, Ryzen 5, 512ssd, 8 gb ram, backlit keyboard and 3 years on site warranty. Moderate usage battery last for 5 hours with work and light gaming."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"How long did you wait for your C340?
I'm seeing delivery more than 4 weeks for the lowest range of C340."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for your review.
I am still thinking to change to Ryzen 7 after I placed order for Ryzen 5.
The difference is $100++"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I received it within 2 weeks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"value for money sia.
yea its a thinkpad. quality is considerably better than other brands."
Lenovo Thinkpad,yup. don't know why there are people here comparing ideapad series or acer low end mod.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Either students or those haven't heard of Thinkpad.
Ideapad is no no, once I tested that it is very crap laptop.
The LCD panel itself is very poor quality especially for entry models."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"What's the difference between E485 and E495 other than the processor?
Is the battery life better on the newer version?
I recalled E485 was only about $600 or so but it's now 800-900"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Battery life should be more or less the same but dependent on usage.
Take note of the WIFI card as E495 is using Intel WLAN which is better
than E485 which is using qualcomm.
If I were you, I just get the newer E495 will do."
Lenovo Thinkpad,anyone tested E495 under load? how is the temperature and fan noise?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"@orlengtao surprised that you are not getting better battery life like the e595 as per Hive
Can you run the following command for battery life estimate. there will be a html report generated & then just look for the batt estimate heading
1 Run CMD as admin
2 powercfg /batteryreport
Perhaps @Hive and @batniss swift 3 can run the above command & share their results as well. If e485 and e585 owners also share their results, then easier to compare."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My battery last 4 hours on first charge, full charge.
Haven't go to second charge yet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Unfortunately we shared different opinions on ""value for money"". Hence even if i managed to show you a better result, it will not yield much to the people who already has fixated mindsets. I am just sharing with an open-heart yet all i got was sarcasm. However, i understand some people are die-heart fans so is ok.
I believe a Thinkpad can easily thrash Nvidia MX250 because of the built of the laptop. Your processing power is based on the word thinkpad. Put the thinkpad word means ur laptop is faster by 2000% like those people stick ""Type R"" on the back of the car... nitro boost yo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I also don't know why. I thought is Thinkpad. No idea when it becomes IdeaPad. Didn't know intel & nvidia are considered low end mods either. Now i know, i rest my case."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"should I get the e495 or a485? mostly using it for videos, excel ~3-5mb with macros surfing net with 10-15tabs and occasional light gaming.

e495 seems to have solved the thermal throttling issue, but battery life is weak, generally less well built than A series
a485's thermal throttling issue seems to be quite serious even though it's supposedly better built? only Ryzen 3 Pro or Ryzen 7 Pro is available for selection. Which is better, given the thermal throttling issue? battery life should be much better with the additional 72wh battery.
Going to get another 8gb stick for either choice.
Would love to especially hear from users of the A485 Thinkpad!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"sure will do it tomorrow. I set high performance and max brightness, maybe that's y lower. TBH, if battery life is a prob, don't get this
Edited: my battery life report
save that as .html"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Incase you need more reasons to get the e495
3500U is definately the better option imo. better sustain load then 7."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Battery report for A485 Ryzen 3, with extended 72kWh battery + 24kWh built in battery.

>> Current estimate of battery life based on all observed drains since OS install
Since OS install 	9:34:22
Workload is O365 Outlook, Word, Excel, Acrobat, Web browser Chrome, firefox"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"E495, take note thermal throttling on A485 is serious as it is only single heat pipe compare with E serious.
Unless you have deep pocket than go for the new T495 but I feel E495 will do fine."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not to mention the Spectre and Meltdown security issues plague Intel processors which impact the performance.
However like in the article mention AMD laptop battery isn't that great
so have to wait for E495 review than how long exactly is the battery."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Current estimate of battery life based on all observed drains since OS install:
3:34:37 h
This is on a E585 with the following specs 2500U, 2x8GB RAM, M2 PCI-E Samsung PM981 256GB and Samsung 250GB.
Been using this notebook for 7 weeks now.
Primary usage is having 3 different browsers Firefox, PaleFox, Brave running at any time, occasionally running Virtualbox.
LCD brightness 80%."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Been camping here a while.
Hope to see the battery life for E595"
Lenovo Thinkpad,E595 just over 4 hours of battery life. Maybe if office work light usage typing surf net could go almost 6 hours with screen brightness at medium.
Lenovo Thinkpad,What is the difference between E495 and E595 other than the screen size and keyboard? Battery capacity is the same right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yup. The E585 & E595 does not make use of the additional space for a higher capacity battery
Lenovo Thinkpad,"So apparently, Linux compatibility has been improved in the Ex95 series. Though you will need kernel parameter to work with the NVME SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Just placed an order for E495
Lenovo Thinkpad,"How do I clone the original factory image? Because I ordered the Windows 10 home edition. Planning to clean install Windows 10 Pro
Sent from Samsung SM-N960F using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lenovo have download tool to restore the laptop back to factory.
However I would advice not to use that as factory image are rubbish.
Even if you want to sell, can just install Windows 10 home on it
and done."
Lenovo Thinkpad,how's the T495 like? hardly any reviews yet. Can get it at about $1250 now..is it worth it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Play the spin wheel for 15% off discount code. About 1025 after that for base option.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"using ""COUPO"" allows for 18% off..
just wondering whether the a485 or the t496 is the lesser of the evils - thermal throttling & being heavier vs more expensive & having the exhaust beside your mouse"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"How to do a clean install? Seems like the default windows 10 home digital license is tied to the laptop. I dl the media creation and install with a USB but it always default to the Home edition. I have a oem Windows 10 Pro key
Sent from Samsung SM-N960F using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Agree with the E495 being the better deal in this case. And yes, the A series is really about portability and light weight, so the cut back on the heatpipe is certainly a problem. In fact, when I was reapplying thermal paste for my E485, I realized the 2 heatpipes heat up significantly even with the slightest load. So if 2 is just enough to keep the temps in check, 1 heatpipe will likely not cut it unless it is one fat heatpipe."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Download Windows 10 ISO to USB.
Just install as usual, it will install Home edition first.
Than later open the MS store to activate the pro key.
Windows 10 will upgrade itself to Home than to pro."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Tried but still say my laptop is tied to the windows 10 home digital license? Anymore with the same problem? Maybe I shd use a earlier version of Windows creation tool
Sent from Sony SGP771 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Right Click on the ""Start"" button and select ""System""
On the ""About"" page, scroll down and click on ""Change product key or upgrade your edition of Windows"""
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Doubt it's Windows build error, where did you buy the key from?
If from Caurosell or places that sell $10 keys, those probably are MS volume
license key.
You need the Windows installer from the MDSN/Dreamspark website
in order for the key to work. As such key are either enterprise
or education license.
It's still a pro version but with a different type of license.
Take note unless you are intending to use the laptop for office, like domain joining than you need pro version.
Else home version will do fine for home use."
Lenovo Thinkpad,after seeing another folk posting abt this quite gian liao
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Whoa, the T495 does have 2 more LCD options.
Memory is 8GB soldered with an additional slot for expansion.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"T series have more option than E series, beside that.
There is also WWAN card, take note by default it is included.
If you don't need it than remove to save $.
Max out configuration will cost about $1.8k - $2k so twice of a
max out E495/E595.
The only concern is if it is still using single heat pipe, for gaming
it isn't ideal.
There is the X395 but the only downside is the RAM cannot be upgraded."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"T495S vs X395
Much difference except the display size and battery wh?

Another question is that Lenovo Ideapad S540 seems similar in specs.  But it does not have the $1 3 year warranty upgrade and less configuration options. I am looking at it mainly because it seems lighter and slimmer.

How does S540 compare to E495? i am using an Ideapad 710s for past few many years. Overall it works well for me, no issues with the hinge, but admit that touch pad is poor. Changing because it is rather low spec i3, 4gb ram and getting slow for my needs mainly chrome with 15-20 tabs, word processing, netflix, no games."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The normal HDD is optional. You can always add a 2.5 inch SSD or HDD later since the drive cabby is included by default.
It's mostly for folks who need:
1 Extra storage
2 Dual Boot
Thinkpad E series despite being budget Thinkpads, will still have better build quality than most Ideapads.
Since it's not mentioned specifically, the WIFI card on the S540 is most likely from Realtek or Qualcomm.
So the E495 have a small advantage here due to it's Intel Wifi card.
Lastly, Business line laptops tend to be better supported than consumer lines.
Meaning more frequent & regular BIOS/driver updates."
Lenovo Thinkpad,The wifi card that was shown when I configured my ideapad L340 gaming was the same as the S540 and I expected something not from Intel. Ended up to be the Intel AC 9560 when I received it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I would advice not to consider Ideapad the build quality is not as good as Thinkpad.
Most will opt for SSD + HDD, SSD for OS.
HDD for data, data backup and games.
Especially if SSD fails, at least HDD act as backup."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If current HDD used less than 400GB, then drop the HDD and get SSD512G. If over 400, get the HDD.
Netflix, HWZ, no games: Ryzen 3 + SSD + 8GB RAM is enough. More core = more expensive= more electric = more heat = more fan noise all for nothing when they are not used.
Your cheapest upgrade could be buy a SSD to replace the HDD + 4GBRAM for current system."
Lenovo Thinkpad,shall wait for promo first
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I switched from e485 to IdeaPad 720s and disagree that the build quality on the E series Thinkpads are better. I think IdeaPad higher end series quality wise is better than entry level Thinkpad. For one, the screen assembly on the e485 is too thin such that just touching the back of the screen will cause the LCD to warp.
But between e495 and s540 I will choose e495, if only for the ability to charge the laptop through USB-C which can come in pretty handy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If the OS in SSD, once fails, it fails?
The best way is to setup RAID1 for SSD+HDD?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I've used a high end Lenovo laptop previously and yes it is definitely better. However we need to factor in their price range. Lenovo 7xx series is considered high to mid high end, while the ThinkPad E series is really the budget end. So it is not a good comparison. It will be more appropriate to compare a Lenovo 3xx series with the ThinkPad E series. And in this case, I believe the ThinkPad build will be better since it is after all targeting corporate clients."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Honestly if OS is on the SSD, I don't see the point of doing a RAID 1 on it. It fails it fails. You can always reinstall the OS back on a replaced/new SSD. If you are worried about reinstalling all the apps on the SSD, just do a backup image of the drive and store it somewhere. If required, you just need to clone the image to the new drive. I don't see the need to complicate solution using things like RAID where it is will just exhaust the already limited storage space in a laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No need, what I meant as SSD have write cycle limit.
If it fails and you have to wait for RMA.
At least you can install OS onto the HDD as well as store
all important data on the HDD than SDD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"After viewing for days between E495, E595, X395 & T495
Decide to take up E595 that fits my tight budget
Delivery date estimated at 4 - 5 July"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"In the 1st place, RAID 1 can only be done between storage media of the same
size & type.
You can't do a RAID 1 between SSD & HDD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"if SSD exceeds the TBW and fails, i don't think it is eligible for RMA. Even SSD vendor exclude TBW exceeds from RMA."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for sharing, just citing why there are options for SSD and HDD.
For me my data usually are on HDD but not SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for all the advice. Haven't been following the CPU news for years, glad to hear all the positive things about AMD these days and would like to support them in my next laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for this thread. Just got my E595 today.
My RAM option is 8GB but usable is 5.88GB only.
These 2.12GB is used by graphic card?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"How long it take from the time you order and reach SG?
Mine seems to be estimated 3 weeks++"
Lenovo Thinkpad,It took less than 2 weeks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"How are you checking to see that you have 5.88GB left? The integrated graphics will typically only take up 256mb, and should dynamically allocate more ram to it when you are gaming."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Agree with this approach. However given the fact that nowadays the SSD storage size is reasonably big, if one don't game much, there should be ample of space left. So nowadays, I don't really care that much whether to save on SSD or mechanical drive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I check both Control Panel -> System & Task Manager-> Performance
Both show 5.88GB Usable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"add only $1 million for a 65W ac adapter!!
And $855k for a USB dock"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not the 1st time I have seen pricing mistakes on their Estore.
Saw a >$65k  gaming laptop in April."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Most folks will not be able to check out since credit card limit is insufficient.
Lenovo Thinkpad,My order still not shipping...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Expected to ship shows 22nd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes mine too, reserve 2.1gb ram that is weird.
I try to disable microphone via Bios IO access and i have BSOD. Can someone help to confirm their unit have the same problem please"
Lenovo Thinkpad,So your order shipped？
Lenovo Thinkpad,Nope. No movement
Lenovo Thinkpad,Well 3 hours more to 23th June and nothing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"if u c any wrong pricing that makes the laptop damn cheap and free, do sic.
thanks"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lol are u hoping to make a profit like the singtel pricing error for nokia 6610 in 2002? No more. Lenovo terms and condition will not allow for it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ok, my laptop got shipped but my credit card was not charged. I made payment using paypal. Should i be concerned? When the accessories was shipped the card was immediately charged."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Nothing to worry. They are using ERP system where shipping and billing are two separate function. Their billing run is most probably batched and run periodically. Your PayPal will be deducted during their billing run.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Glad to hear that, waiting mine ship tomorrow"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Now that t495 is out, will y'all choose t495 or e495? Both are AMD ryzen processor but t series is more expensive, why is that so?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"- T series have better build, chassis between T and E are different.
- Longer part availabity for T series since the CPU/APU is
under pro series while E series CPU/APU is consumer grade
- Better configuration like better screen, WWAN cardSIM card can use,
docking station and many others.
Basically T series is intended for business, for home/student
E series will do fine.
E best config is about $1k, T series best config will cost about $1.5k - $2k.
For gaming wise, would be E since it uses the consumer grade CPU/APU
and the heatpipe inside is dual not single which is found in early A/T series.
Pretty much E series will be ideal regardless of usage, unless you want premium laptop and better parts like screen than go for T."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The E495 no backlit kb right?? That's the deal breaker for me, else will be ideal... hmmm.... if goes forT495... the config I get will be ard $1700+ vs the E495 $1200+.... pain...
Funny the description mention got option for backlit kb... but not offer on the model they selling."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, backlight only on T series."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks... not sure wanna up another $500 as the config in E495 is good enough for me, though the T495 screen is delicious...
...."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"T495 one ram slot is soldered, vs E495 of which 2 slot is available, which was the dealbreaker for me. Also cooling is not as good as E495."
Lenovo Thinkpad,OIC... but why oh why they cannot offer a simple backlit kb in E495.... sigh...
Lenovo Thinkpad,e495 cooling is better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"but the price also different ma
For under 1k.. thinkpad is still good."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I just got my E595 and found out that my E595 has a dead pixel. What should I do?
call for exchange or call for onsite warranty?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,You should look up their dead pixel policy first. I get a sense 1 dead pixel is going to be ignored.
Lenovo Thinkpad,When was your credit card charged? For dead pixel policy is min 3 dead pixel to qualify for replacement or on site support.
Lenovo Thinkpad,their dead pixel policy is 3. It just less than 1 week. So sien.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not sure when it was charged.
I just receive last Monday."
Lenovo Thinkpad,When did you receive the invoice for the laptop after the shipping notification email? 1 day after?
Lenovo Thinkpad,ya. 1 day after shipping notification email.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Btw, if just surf web, watch YouTube, do we really need those 400nits display??"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Nope. a 250 nits display will suffice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks, will save me $$$...
Any case, if I wanna go with Thinkpad I need to get the T495 / T495s instead of the E495 cause of the backlit keyboard... basket, with the specs I want, could have pay ard $1200++ instead of $1600++ to $1700++
So T495s > T495 cause its lighter??"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"glad to help. with my 250 nits display i never go pass 50-60% brightness level else it will be too bright esp since i use my laptops for long periods, my eyes cannot take it lol"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes T495s is lighter but much higher price than T495.
Take note if you intend to buy T495, if you want to save $.
Make sure WWAN/Mobile broadband adapter is removed.
As by default it is included with T495."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Noted, thanks bro. Still  considering.... if they just include backlit option for E series..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Bro not sure I miss out anything, but I don't see any WWAN Adapter added in the first place when I configure??"
Lenovo Thinkpad,The brightness is desirable only when you are planning to use it outdoors frequently.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The t495s batt slightly bigger 57w vs 50w on 495 got option to add wwan
Sent from Sony Z4 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Get delayed 😐
Lenovo Thinkpad,What model you ordered?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"E595, dragged to 26 June"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone facing white spot issue on the LCD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Nope. I would send for warranty claim. This is different from dead pixel policy.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyway, just received my E495. Impressed by the built quality. No flex on LCD. Hinge is solid too. Built in RAM is samsung. Added 8gb stick of Cruical ram Micron and it works."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Good to gear that
Mine just out from HeFei"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am looking for a Lenovo Thinkpad
I mainly surf internet, microsoft office and some simple gaming maplestory and fifa online 3
Any recommendations ? Thanks"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Buy thinkpad for photoshop ha
Lenovo Thinkpad,You got any good recommendations other than that
Lenovo Thinkpad,I tok you expert in ps
Lenovo Thinkpad,I am impressed by T495s but the E585 is still working fine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thinkpad T495s
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks a lot
Lenovo Thinkpad,You want to sprout nonsense everywhere in the forum ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,I think will be good to know if you have any specific requirements and your budget. Even the humble E495 can handle all the things you mentioned easily.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi
Weight <2kg
Low budget, around ~$1,300 price lower the better
No need numpad, but the arrow keys must be big
Memory 8GB should be sufficient I guess ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,u can consider this after the ecoupon discount:
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you are targeting a budget laptop, then I feel that E495 will be a good fit. The downside is the poor battery life, which I think can last anything from 3 to 4 hours if you are just surfing net and doing light work on it. If you are not too concerned about battery, E series will be good because it is well built, and there is sufficient cooling for the CPU/GPU. And yes, it should be around 1.7KG."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks guys
Battery life not an issue as I am always on the charger"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Comparing this Thinkpad E495 with my Company issued Dell Latitude 5480 laptop, E495 wins in built quality."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"One more thing - I prefer external battery over built-in...
I have the impression that built-in battery doesn't last long
True"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thinkpad has the utilities that stop charging your battery once it reach a certain percentage.
Built in battery have the same lifetime as external battery. Plus this is thinkpad. Spare parts will be easy to get."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone encounter this prob? E495 cannot connect to 5g wifi?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hi experts, when do lenovo usually have sale? need to get one before 2nd week of Oct for my classes."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Been visiting thier site almost everyday before the purchase
There will be always promotion on different reason like GSS/Raya/IT Fair etc
It will be good you just list down your budget and requirement so other ca advice you
When made a purchase, just buy and make use of
cash back feature"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"What do you guys think of these 2 ?
Any configurations to improve/change or some other models to recommend ?
My requirements:
1. Thinkpad T495

2. Thinkpad E495

3. Thinkpad E595 got numpad though, not really something I am looking for

Thanks"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Only few points:
- For OS best opt for SSD + HDD
OS on SSD while data on HDD
Windows 10 will crawl on 2.5"" HDD especially those with 5400rpm.
- Ram wise
Either opt for 2 X 4GB to tap on dual channel or get 1 X 8GB than add another one.
AMD Ryzen will benefit from dual channel.
For me I will choose the E series than the T series especially if you intend to game."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"When I got my E485, this is one of my consideration. While the internal battery is small, I've managed to get a Aukey 26800mah portable battery that is able to charge the laptop via the Type C port. The Type C charging point is also better as I don't get tied to some proprietary charging port."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Budget less than 1.1k
Laptop for medium sized data analytics with python
Gaming; only play hearthstone
Good ram best is those can upgrade,
Able to dock on docks to link up 2 external monitors
Light."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can anyone please share what is their e495 nvme ssd brand and speed please.
Mine got replaced to Toshiba today because cant solve a driver issue.
Boot up and folder files loading became slow."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks a lot for the info
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hihi
Processor
- AMD Ryzen 5 should be sufficient right ? Need to change to Ryzen 7 ?
- SSD + HDD
How about I choose a dummy HDD and select a 500GB SSD ?
Thanks"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"- Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 not much difference so 5 will be enough
- Really up to your preference but I will opt for SSD OS and HDD Data
Else you can opt for bigger SSD and a dummy HDD.
However bigger the SSD it will cost more."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The RAID/AHCI driver what is currently being installed?
MS one or AMD?
Maybe you want to try AMD Chipset driver from AMD website.
Extract the RAID/AHCI driver and install see whether does it improve or not.
For what I know Lenovo doesn't provide Chipset driver for AMD based laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,mine is E595 with 512GB NVME. The brand is WD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks for the update. Can help do a speed test for comparison please.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Made some changes, looks good ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Quite similiar with my E595 configuration
Just recieved my lappy and feel snappy so far"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Remember to add 1 buck to upgrade the 1 year carry in warranty to 3 years onsite warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,How to add the 1 buck upgrade to 3 years onsite??
Lenovo Thinkpad,Some faster some slower...
Lenovo Thinkpad,I think the 3 years warranty cost changed from $1 to $72.50 now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thank you appreciate your help
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I don't know if it is a psychological thing that you find it slower. While the numbers on the benchmark look like a performance drop, that don't really mean much in real life scenarios, especially when it comes to boot up speed. Check any reviews out there and you will noticed that even from a SATA3 SSD to a full speed NVME drive, there may only be a few seconds difference when it comes to boot up and file loading speed. Boot up speed is likely a second difference."
Lenovo Thinkpad,yeah true. i also thought my laptop slowed down after using it for a few days.. UNTIL i went back to my old laptop with slow HDD and then back to the new one and suddenly it felt as fast as new again
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The E485/E495 is an underrated gem.
With proper tweaking, it's a very capable machine."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I agree. Only downside is the poor battery life, due to small battery. But one can overcome this problem with a good PD power bank that can output at least 45W."
Lenovo Thinkpad,which ssd u bought?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone knows why Lenovo SG site don't offer 4K screen on their X nor T series?
Lenovo Thinkpad,E495/E595 comes with samsung SSD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not worth seriously, not only pricing but battery will drain."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Bought outside. I bought samsung 1tb ssd at amazon for only 150 sgd.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Roughly how Long can the battery last ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,My usage is surf net + YouTube. Roughly around 5 hours.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone try to use its 45W charger to charge Surface Go?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Which model? Can share more details? Really good buy.
Sent from HUAWEI MATE 10 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hi guys,
Not sure this is a valid question - If I opt for additional SSD , Lenovo will install the OS on SSD right? The last thing I want is for them to install windows on the HDD duh when I added on SSD"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually I see no point in having a 4K screen on a laptop. First the screen is too small, so you will need to scale the fonts to about 250%, and in some cases that it does not scale, you will struggle to see. Secondly, it drains battery fast which is not good if you bring your laptop around. Thirdly if you game, there is no mobile graphic that can offer you a smooth game play at native resolution if you are into modern graphic intensive games.
My recommendation if you do want a 4K screen, just get a 4K monitor to supplement it. I got a mobile 15.6 inch 4K monitor for about 250 bucks. It has the same problem I mentioned in my first point, but its optional and I usually only plug it in when I need 2 screens for work, or for watching movies."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"4 to 5 hours max. If you want to extend the battery, you can always buy a 20000 MAh or higher PD power bank with a minimal of 45W output to give it more power. The power bank is optional only when you need it. In case the power bank dies after some time, you can just get another one to replace."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Should be on the SSD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It's the PM981, the E485 I've ordered comes configured with it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wah... Much faster than my E595 WD.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks ...
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For students, will a Ideapad 520S better suit their needs or u guys still think Thinkpad E495 is the way to go??  The ideapad lighter though."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Curious about this too
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think so, my company issued X series with dual drives has the OS on the SSD."

Lenovo Thinkpad,did you apply shopback? they are giving 9% cashback for lenovo's site
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It's the usual Lenovo hardware lottery. Dell does the same too.
They usually have a minimum of 2 suppliers for most hardware components."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes I did, thanks to reminders in this thread"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi there, wanted to check if anyone tried running a 4K video on this GPU? I noticed its lagging somewhat. Its not a E485/585 issue, but I read it somewhere that mentioned that the driver is the culprit."
Lenovo Thinkpad,My e595 lags and sometimes goes black screen for a second before playing 1080p video on YouTube.. not sure why since my config is Ryzen 7 3700u.. not sure if its because Im using single channel 16gb ram only.. will adding another 16gb stick help in this case?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"On which web browser?
Also update to the latest AMD graphic drivers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"using chrome?
its chrome problem.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Disable HW acceleration, some had done this and it works."
Lenovo Thinkpad,My config is Ryzen 5 and 16GB Ram. Also facing the same issue. Using chrome browser.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For Youtube, I agree it is a problem with Chrome. After all, I have disabled HW acceleration for good on it due to multiple issues with it not just on this laptop, but on my past few desktops as well. I just tried on Edge and it works fine.
However I do noticed some initial video lag when I start watching a movie on iTunes too. No issues on my desktop, but on the laptop, it seems to lag whenever I start the show. Its not a network issue as I download the shows I purchased. I think need to try and update the driver to see if the issue will go away to if it is an iTunes issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi, any one can recommend compatible RAM to replace? looking to replace with 16GB x02 piece and anyone can advise if this E595 will run smoothly with PhotoShop usage? Thanks in advance! =D"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"nah, what u need is a discrete card which this notebook doesn't have.
Oh wait, with the Thinkpad badge, you shouldn't have the need to change anything it should still run like butter."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Thinkpad E595 review is out:
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks! sounds like i shouldn't worried.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It depends on your usage and expectation actually. 2 things I feel will be a problem if you are a hardcore photoshop user,
1 Screen is not that great - You will need a better external monitor.
2 CPU is that very powerful due to 15W TDP - So you can't expect it to process as fast as say a 35/45/65W CPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"16 GB should be able to run Photoshop well enough. You should use the money to buy a bigger SSD, CPU and best screen as Photoshop is more disk and CPU intensive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"E595 is using low wattage CPU at 15W, so even if it can run.
It won't run that as fast like desktop or laptop with H series CPU/APU.
Since it is intended for portability and long battery than high performance.
Unfortunately AMD Ryzen H laptop are not available locally,
example Asus FX505DT AMD Ryzen 5 3550H, Nvidia Geforce 1650
would be a better option.
Alternate would be Intel H series since most of them are sold locally.
This also applies to Intel so depend on your budget, H series laptop
are much expensive since they usually means gaming laptop.
Example Dell G5 at $1.5k would handle Photoshop much faster than E595
since it is using Intel H series processor.
Downside of laptop using H like Dell G5 is the weight."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all,
I got my E495 for 2 weeks and really enjoyed as it is better than my work Laptop which is an E440. Able to play casual games at low setting is great for me.
I do face a small issue, I had shut down the computer but often it restarted randomly instead of shutting down. What I mean is after I shut down, the screen turns black and then it sort of restarted the computer and goes to the start screen
Any assistance would be appreciated"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Few things:
- Have you perform full Windows update?
- You can try this:

-

- Try use CMD,
At run type ""Shutdown -s -t 00""
All else fails, may have to do a clean format.
Maybe either driver or OS issues."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I still facing the same issue. Will try to upgrade to 1903 and see how.
Lenovo Thinkpad,This is quite odd. I face an odd issue as well where the laptop will randomly boot into repair mode at startup.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I had a similar configuration on my S340. Only difference is I had a 512gb SSD and no HDD
Is there a difference between L340 and S340?
Paid 590 for this after shopback"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"An Update, this only happens when the laptop is plugged in. MY setup is the laptop with HDMI out to the monitor. Once I plugged out the power cord and shut down the laptop. It will shut down without restarting.
I tried to reset the power option, Lenovo Vantage and also what techidiot suggest. No luck for now but will see after it will happen again after a feature update."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"There should be an option in the BIOS called Power On with AC Attach BIOS > Config > Power, trying setting that to Disabled if not already and see if that that helps"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all, hearing all the good things about AMD E series really gave me the confidence to get E495 with the configuration below with the aim of upgrading the ram and M.2 SSD later on. Only taking 512 NIVME as I'm not so experienced in self-installation of NVIME.
Most importantly, can anyone share their experience of DIY upgrading and advise the recommended brand and model of rams/ssd besides Crucial, who listed themselves as Lenovo compatible.
Or is there any shop recommended to bring down and ask them to help me install the parts I want? Thanks for any input!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Take note warranty you can change to 3 years.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"But its not on $1 or $0.01 offer anymore. Now 3 years on-site warranty $72.50.
It's still worth it? Not sure of RMA and warranty process as this is my first Lenovo Thinkpad"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Oh... than it's up to you. Cheers.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"72.50 to be honest is not expensive, though I am unsure if the warranty is onsite or carry in. If it is onsite, then you can consider from a peace of mind perspective where you don't have to bring the laptop down for servicing since someone is supposed to come to you for repairs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"On site warranty means they will service your ThinkPad at your office or home. Save the hassle to send and collect from service centre.
Most importantly, your private data will be safe."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeah, i also just bought via Lenovo and got the $72.50 3 years on-site warranty. Just order the Lenovo X395 using the Ryzen 5 3500U. Hopefully will be ok"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Was deciding between E494 and Ideapad S540, but bought the Ideapad S540 instead due to the nicer design. Paid for extended warranty for a total of 2 years."
Lenovo Thinkpad,ThinkPad is for easy open and good typing experience. Ideapad is more lifestyle and focus more on slick design.
Lenovo Thinkpad,X395 or e495 better? Why is x395 more exp even tho the processor is just ryzen 3
Lenovo Thinkpad,"14 inch via 13.3 inch
What do you decide this between both?
Weight : 1.25kg vs 1.75kg
X395 Ryzen Pro vs E495 non Pro CPU.
X395 ram onboard while E495 ram can upgrade.
E495 no fingerprint and backlight keyboard.
The rest all same"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"As what obichacha have quoted, X and E series are different.
The APU/CPU is also different, X395 uses Ryzen 3 pro.
X series is intended for ultralight weight and portability
so it is much lighter than E.
Take note X395 ram isn't upgradable and it only have SSD option
as compare with e495 where you can opt for SSD and HDD.
Basic use e495 will do fine."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks, I will try on that. So far as long the laptop not fully charged at 100%, it will not on. I played with the Lenovo Vantage to stop charging at 95%. So far no issue"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Power cord at 65W mean it charge faster then 45W?
Lenovo Thinkpad,X2 faster than the 45W
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lol 😂 hopefully will ship out in time
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just received my E595, can't help but notice an electrical buzzing sound.
It's not loud but it's audible in a quiet room.
You guys think this is normal?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"oh no, i feel like getting E595 also, sounds like HDD issue or fan issue.
otherwise, how is the performance so far?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,No complaints about performance. Will monitor the buzzing sound
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I own an E595 and help my fren buy a budget HP Ryzen 3 laptop.
So far veey satisfy with the performance for the money paid."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually the performance of Ryzen already proven.. i tested multiple setup with Ryzen 3 & i think compare to Intel entry setup this really flies...
only concern is on the reliability.. need to see how it is proven.
AMD used to gave us reliability issue around 2-3 years... with processing speed improving & SSD these lappy nowadays can last 3- 5 years... & still very good"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Nowadays the recent laptops can’t even last more than 4 years, cause due to software upgrade much faster than our hardware.
Unless you keep this for general use purposes.
For AMD technology can last you more than 3 years, this is consider Super worthy for money."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo kept postponing ... twice .. saying parts issue ... cancelled my order ... hope you have better luck.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"How you cancel your order? My E490 also got delayed, tried using their live chat but it doesn't even load the thing when I press it, do I have to call them? Wonder if I can still cancel since I already received my bag and mouse first."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"G5 where got so cheap
Maybe G3 la
Hahaha coz I wan buy also"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Mainlycoz of this window 10? Then shitty to me
Lenovo Thinkpad,What games r u playing???
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Then go live chat and ask for more discount.
Usual they do for all customers"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I got my refund thru livechat at the lenovo website.  the customer rep emailed their logistics side to expedite but even he didnt get a reply from this own logistics!  he helped me close the account.
i saved myself the nightmare of delays and further delays and went to SLS and bought a Dell on the spot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Buzzing sound may be a coil whine. At least I don't notice it on the older E485.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I don't know how you can quantify AMD reliability at around 2 to 3 years. Do note that say if you buy a laptop, while the laptop is powered by an AMD chip, the parts selected in a laptop is the responsibility of the manufacturers. So if you want cheap, then do expect some corners to be cut, i.e. poorer quality components used. Moreover, there is no guarantee that even top end components will not fail. I've used multiple laptops, and I am sure Intel powered laptops have a clean sheet in terms of failure rate. But I don't ding them as it is the laptop manufacturers' problem most of the time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeah bought the same accessories as you.
Waiting for them to deliver to me on 13 August 2019"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"AMD laptop still cheaper in markets.
Talk about reliable wise, just use to it, cause they are newer in market now.
How they proven has not issue, anyway just trust on ThinkPad with add up your warranty.
I don’t think that Intel CPU doesn’t needs warranty so far.
For me that is the options, either AMD or Intel.
IF you have more budget go for Intel will do.
I will look forward about AMD performance 😂"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lol your ordered is faster than me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Another reason going for Ryzen for me is to prevent intel monopoly. Lol 😃
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Intel is fine, just the CPU runing hot when charging while runing a software.
Mine was i7-8550U the exhaust fan runing high speed all the time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"just wanted to share some notes on the E495.  was deciding between either the E495 or E595, as the price difference was very slight.  In the end, choose the 14"" as it is lighter.
ordered on 23/7 and finally got it on 2/8 late at night.  impressed with the UPS delivery as they delivered at 9+ at night.
upgraded the M2 SSD to Adata XPG SX8200 Pro. very impressed by the performance! did not realize that PCIe gen3x4 NVMe is so much faster compared to traditional SATA SSD. cost $120
also upgraded the RAM to Crucial DDR4 2400, 2 sticks of 16GB, total 32GB. cost $190
bought both from SLS, good value for $ upgrades.
overall, very impressed with the build quality, the keyboard, the IPS screen, easy to upgrade both the RAM and M2 SSD.  also came with the 2.5"" bracket, so I was able to reuse my old 2.5"" SSD from my old laptop.
I would say for a $700+ laptop, this is the best value in the market now for the specs. especially the FHD IPS screen, the Intel Wireless-AC 9260 2x2 AC, Bluetooth 5.0
consumer grade laptop price, but getting more business grade laptop quality.
great keyboard, comfortable to type on for long time, not sure if it is really spill proof like the old generations Thinkpads... but for this price, no complaints.
Cons, heavy compared to my previous 13"", but the X395 was a little pricey and not as value for $ as this.  no backlit keyboard option on the E495, if they had this, it would have been perfect.
I hope this helps folks out there deciding if they should consider buying this."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Nice, I decided to go for the E490 instead but damn your shipping is not bad, I ordered mine on 25/07, was expected to shipped on 2/8 but now the expected shipping delayed to 6/8, the wait killing me"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Casual Games like World of Warships, Starcraft 2 and RTS games. Trying out older titles like Left 4 Dead 2.
So far the power issue is solved. Not sure why it is so but will monitor if have any issues."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"just ordered the E595.
Upgraded:
Ram 8gb x 8gb
screen to ips
256gb ssd
3yrs on site warranty
remember to use shopback for additional 9% off expire tomorrow"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just received my Lenovo X395 with Ryzen 5. When i started updating system updates, install Office 2019 and syncing my emails while charging, the laptop is intensely hot. But after that, its cool. Fast and Smooth"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hahah, no worries bro.
Can tell you , even my X1 Carbon 6th i7-8550U had same issue , the air vent blower hot air non stop, especially charging while installation."
Lenovo Thinkpad,54% discount for T495 now
Lenovo Thinkpad,yeah its insane..
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I bought me t495 just last month with only 15% discount..... Should have waited...
I wonder how limited is their limited stock"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Do you have the discount?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Where?
Lenovo website?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Seems like T495 won't be able to support dual channel memory? Only one onboard memory and one SODIMM slot?
Lenovo Thinkpad,54BDAY
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yup, on the official site.
Code:54BDAY"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"To be honest, you will never see this coming. Since you already got it, just enjoy it. No point stalking around the site to monitor prices."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I didn't stalk the site, promo email in my inbox with a prominent big big red red 54% laughing at me"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Very seriously, crazy offer , I buy later.
Mobile browser has issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yep. This offer for T495 is even better than student discount.  I am waiting till tomorrow to buy as I left a message for ""free on-site 3 years"""
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hi what model is this? isnt the x395 better? also 256GB Solid State Drive, M.2 2280, NVMe, Opal, TLC
vs 256GB Solid State Drive, M.2 2280, SATA, OPAL 2.0, TLC
which is better?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"NVMe PCIe Opal is better, actually ThinkPad used with Samsung PM981, this is realiable product."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"X395 the higher model. Yes.
What we mean to say is that for this ntational day promotion, T495 promotion percentage  is better than X395 promotion percentage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Bought mine finally, fast hand fast leg before sold out."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you compare the laptop weight and design with chassis cover, X395 is better than the T495, just X395 without extra ram slot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,ur forgetting the wwan. t495 has it
Lenovo Thinkpad,how come ur price lower with the same specs as mine in my laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Why my same config costs more than you? Did I missed out anything?
Lenovo Thinkpad,ya i am same as you. same price. how come hes is lower?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Not too sure what specs do you added.
Lenovo Thinkpad,same as u posted on the forum lor
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can you all share your specs?
Lenovo Thinkpad,can share ur order number?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lai lai show what you added?
I am very interested to know about your specs as well. 😆😆😆"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Cannot lah, order number is confidential 😏"

Correct boh, going to hoot! felt sad for my E585 and my wallet"
Lenovo Thinkpad,huh u got e585 still hoot
Lenovo Thinkpad,"E585 is last year lah but this 54% is too awesome to miss!
heart pain!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya lucky HWZ members keep posting for discount code.
Otherwise miss out the good deal today."
Lenovo Thinkpad,next year national day u how? buy another one har?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"They don't have this yearly de, that's why... maybe they wanted to promote AMD CPU.
Only Ryzen 5 can have onboard 16GB memory, if you order Ryzen 7 is only can have 8GB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wa damn so tempted to hoot! But my E490 delivering tomorrow...
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Order T495 and return your E490, probably need to pay restocking fee."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"T series and E series what's the difference?
Is the cooling better on the e495 or T495?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"the wwan option and mobile card already is worth more than $165 i check for other models, dont"
Lenovo Thinkpad,i wonder if the multi touch option for screen is a good choice?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"if onboard is 8, and add another 8gb .. will it be in dual channel"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hoot Ryzen 5 because of this issue. So on board 16GB + another 16GB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Looking at the 8 + 8 option
Lenovo Thinkpad,Good for you!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is three year on site free of charge or really $72.50?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Based on what i add.. it puts 72.50
Lenovo Thinkpad,"On board 8 GB can it be taken out and replaced to 16GB coz i wanted to
upgrade it didnt get from lenovo. thanks"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This is soldered on I think. 1 soldered on, 1 replaceable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thank you bro. So no more 0.01$ three year on-site for today.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The restocking fee turned me off, will just settle with my E490. Enjoy to those who are hooting the T495!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,It should be soldered on. not removable iirc
Lenovo Thinkpad,"After adding the price,
it is still worth it i guess? cause of the bday coupon."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Oh then i can only add another ram in the empty slot ...i thought i can replaced it to make it 32 GB ...now i stuck with it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you want 32 must go with 16gb option for the onboard..
than the other 16 i guess u can put in yourself? Not sure
i rather just get 16 + 16 like the other guy if you need, save your trouble."
Lenovo Thinkpad,16GB is enough for all uses. No need to worry.
Lenovo Thinkpad,oh dear wonder whether i can cancelled the order?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Why? So good deal today.
Lenovo Thinkpad,You could try live chat but they ask me to email to cancel orders.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"T495 : 8 or 16gb onboard is selected.
Additional 16gb ram slot for you to add or keep it empty.
A. 8gb onboard + 16gb = 24
B. 16gb onboard + 16gb = 32
C. 16gb onboard like my specs now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks very much for the help
Lenovo Thinkpad,Agreed. Tks for confirmation.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"[Quote]
I was wondering whether 16GB will be supported of not. Officially , accourding to Lenovo recommendation this laptop supports 4GBSoldered + 8GBOpen slot = 12GB of total memory. But I checked on Crucial offical site what model I would need. The site showed me 16GB would be supported so I ordered one. I put the 16GB in open slot & turned the laptop on. WALLAH...IT WORKS !!! Now I'm getting 4GB + 16GB = 20GB of total memory. I was facing stuttering while playing Gears of war 4 but now the stuttering is gone. The RAM gives enough head room for multitasking also & help to run graphics intensive aplications so easily .
But previously I was getting 30GB/s read & write speed from OEM memory , Now it goes down to 20GB/s read & write speed. Although I am not seeing any issue with this speed but It is quite slow than OEM RAM.
Anyway 16GB will work on single RAM slot.
[unquote]"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Additional ram can buy from amazon or AliExpress
Samsung, crucial, micron : ddr4
SG$ 13.36  62％ Off | Crucial DDR4 RAM 8GB 4GB 16G LAPTOP 2400MHZ 2666MHZ  2133MHZ  1.2V CL17 Memory so-dimm ddr4 For  notebook"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya actually my office workstations need 32gb to run : 3 to 4 Revit Model and autocad as well.
Actually 16gb is good than enough, specially for this business laptop.
Again out of market gaming laptop just comes with 16gb of standard specs so far.
[QUOTE=stillgottheblues;122159641]"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ya too good a deal to miss I think i just add another 8 or 16 GB myself
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks for the infor
Lenovo Thinkpad,the only negative is the display 1080p. why not 2k display?
Lenovo Thinkpad,very tempted to put in my order
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You can said, they offer with 400nits for this packaged.
If compare to Lenovo Malaysia just had 300nits and without backlit keyboard ,
Lol"
Lenovo Thinkpad,3 hours more to go!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Forgot to say, please use cashback to login Lenovo and get further discount. I got $101 cashback Can refer you if you are new and get another $5 off each person I think."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Could not resist..
its a pretty good deal!
get it people!! before its gone!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Buy now regret later
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I don't know whether there will be another good deal like that, try to amplified to as many people as possible but most people are not interested, LOL"
Lenovo Thinkpad,400 nits no multi-touch? So it's between more nits or touchscreen feature?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Brightness is more important than touch in my opinion.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes they have option for multi touch but the Color accurate very bad, just 42% of SRGB only"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks guys. Just ordered and received this on the page. Is it normal?
Your order needs to be further reviewed.
Your request has been received and is being proceed. We will contact you to complete your order. If you have any additional questions or if any of this information is incorrect, please call 800-601-1481 and refer to the order and customer number."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Maybe is your credit card transaction issue.
Check online ebanking is it go through.
Can ask the live chat."
Lenovo Thinkpad,i got the same page also. checking with live chat now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Live chat could not help. They will get back to me next week. CC was not charged.
Could be qty for promo hit liao... Oh well hope they eventually complete the order."
Lenovo Thinkpad,my live chat told me to check tomorrow for the email confirmation. got some compliance check.
Lenovo Thinkpad,did u do the cashback?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyone miss yesterday deal?
I had never get this price before.
Good deal for T495. 😍😍"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I missed the deal !
Lenovo Thinkpad,yeah i did. thats the problem?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Whats so good about this laptop?
I see dell $1.2k with 1050ti siaz"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"ThinkPad is known for its durability and if you get the 2-yr premium service package its value for money.
For Dell, unless you are referring to their Latitude range....
My opinion only.... Dells Inspiron is comparable to Lenovos IdeaPad range."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Dell keyboard can’t meet a ThinkPad level yet.
Dell keyboard touch feeling most likely same as MacBook Pro.
For me ThinkPad keyboard is a bested, like no other.
Again Dell business laptop more on aluminium case while the ThinkPad on plastic, poly foam mixed with carbon design, much durable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I dont know much about diff model as I used a few before only.
Now comparing to dell G3?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"8th Generation Intel® Core™ i5-8300H Processor Quad-Core, 8MB Cache, up to 4.0GHz w/ Turbo Boost
Windows 10 Home 64 bit English
NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1050Ti 4GB GDDR5
8GB, 1x8GB, DDR4, 2666MHz
128GB M.2 PCIe NVMe Solid State Drive + 1TB 5400RPM 2.5 SATA Hard Drive
Dell is like the above and is a gaming laptop, the base config is $1,195.00.
T495 is a business class laptop. For $1,200 plus actual cost $2.3 plus you get much more. 32GB ram, 1TB SSB, WWAN etc all under 1.6kg."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Easy... it's a ""thinkpad"" lenovo
keyboard, quality all of a certain standard.
T series hardly easy to find under 1k for such specs...
The 32gb ram and 1TB SSD option also worth it .. 1.2 +"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Don’t said about 32gb ram 😂😂😂
I miss the chance due to Budget on 1k.
Just now bought additional crucial 16gb DDR4 2666mhz from Taobao. 🤭"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Specs may trump E495/E595/T495 since it is using Intel H series.
I myself is using Dell G3 Intel i7, few things to take note:
- Surface is rather hot when gaming and fan is loud
- Despite it is slim but it is heavy around 2.5kg and a massive power brick.
E495/E595/T495 weights below 2KG
Build itself is not bad but mostly plastic so to compare with business
laptops is not a good comparison.
For Dell premium consumer grade laptop would be Dell XPS
but XPS price you can go for T series instead."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Must come this space often, lenovo still will churn out AMD laptops more and more"
Lenovo Thinkpad,How often are such promotions ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Still a good deal
Dell G3 cannot compare to T series, one is gaming consumer, one is business enterprise.
Other than a better gpu, the other specs and build will lose out to T series, though you wouldn't really buy a T series for gaming other than some light ones.
want to compare T series, dell business Latitude would be a better comparison imo"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yesterday I chatted with the support. He said that he could not provide free three year on-site at no cost . However , he could provide three year on site at 1 cent + laser mouse at 1 cent + top load case at 1 cent.
So I placed my order without the three items and he manually added it in for me order total increased by 3 cents"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lenovo generally have the usual promotions quite often..
During those events like IT shows etc, nightly discounts, anniversary etc.
This one was NDP, i guess until next NDP?
Keep a lookout on this thread sometimes"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Shiok! save even more!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I hope we get dual heatpipe cooling
for the T495.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I see. Thanks
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyway just single heat pipe only.
Cause that is business laptop.
Look at T490 come with Dua heat pipes, but just single cooling fan only"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks for all feedback
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yes. This 54% promo for T495 was unprecedented.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Dell G series can do compare with Y series Legion gaming laptop only.
But the design too bulky 😆😆😆"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This is the highest offer I have seen for a Thinkpad, though I wish it was a T495s version"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Very bad, I didn’t check with T495s model.
Now the most higher discount code was : COUPO"
Lenovo Thinkpad,T495s do not have 54% discount. You could have to cough out $728.86 more!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Haha, but T495 good enough for me.
As Long this model can have additional ram slot to add on, while the T495s don’t have.
About the weight of T495s is lighter as X395."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Dear all.  I will soon have two windows 7 dinosaur laptops that I will not use. Can I confirm that generally there is zero resale value?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Maybe if you can somehow upgrade it to win10
Otherwise.. don't think got much use.. maybe some legacy user will buy and use"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can you show the model/specs of dinosaur laptop.
Regarding the windows can update easily."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Which models
Lenovo Thinkpad,"any1 know if e595 can run in flex mode?
i have 2x4gb
would like to change to 1x4gb + 1x8gb
cos i need more than 8gb but not more than 10 - 11gb"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"32gb Max DDR4 2400mhz
Either 4 + 8 or 4 + 16gb ram , if you have 2666mhz the board just recognise on 2400mhz only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Both are Sony Vaio from many years ago bro.   Very old models. I don't think Sony make them anymore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Have they updated you on the status?
Sent from null using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Just curious how T495 can have max of 32gb since onboard is fixed at 8gb
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Base package can’t select for extra 16gb onboard.

Step 2 upgrade your APU to 5300.

Step 3 additional 16gb free slot can be add in future or at same time.

Total 32gb ram, 16gb onboard + 16gb ram on addition slot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thank you Obichaha.  This is very detailed. Now I also understand why I don't see it the option is not available for Ryzen 7 combination that I ordered
Lenovo Thinkpad,nope. u waiting too?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i skipped the t495 as the screen 1080p nia.
only setback else ill pull the trigger"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Option for T490, T490s and X1 Carbon 7th gen 😍😍😍😍😍"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes. Hoping for good news
Sent from null using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am thinking which option should I pick:
1. Memory - I have an existing HP 4+4 and Lenovo 8+4
Memory usage on the Lenovo is around 30% while the HP exceeds 40-45%, and the HP laptop is laggy I am unaware if there is any other reasons

2. SSD
PCIe-NVMe and NVMe?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Nothing wrong with the screen size to be honest. This is a 14 inch laptop, so I don't see the point of getting anything more than 1080p. The resolution is about as high as the onboard graphics can support anyway."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ryzen 7 CPU have 8GB soldered on RAM while Ryzen 5 can select 16GB RAM.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You should add for 8x2 = 16gb dual channel.
Ssd 256gb is a minimun, but that is fast."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Miss the deal, now best px is 1500+! Boohoo"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just do my customize same specs as your.
The minimum was 1.8k, how you get from 1.5++?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"How you manage 1500?
got another discount code?
same config now around 2k"
Lenovo Thinkpad,same. probably got to wait till tomorrow already
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thank you. But will 4+8 = 12gb be sufficient?
How does the RAM work actually, as in which RAM will the computer it utilize first, whichever RAM on the 1st slot?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes 12gb good than enough.
If you have extra Budget go for 16gb more than enough.
Usually graphic card will taken from total of 30% memory.
So your efficient memory just left about 70% only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,8 + 4 and not 8 + 8? Don't want dual channel or do this laptop don't use dual channel?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Laptop working for combined of total Ram, doesn’t mean do you want the Dual channel of the same memory, either 4 + 8 or 8+8 or 4+16gb, cause some of the laptop comes with 4GB onboard, after added with 16gb ram, you can have more multi tasking."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks
I am considering E495.
My Lenovo G40 has 4 slots I suppose.
Slot 1 8GB, Slot 2 Empty, Slot 3 4GB, Slot 4 Empty
Speed 1600MHz"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes you can consider for E495, if you can get cheaper now.
The discount code : COUPO.



Below is our bro selling new laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Talk to Lenovo live chat and let them know your Cart ID.
Apparently there was an issue on Friday and some orders were diverted for export compliance review. The review has been completed and the orders are saved as carts, so need to reorder again. Only Cart ID of failed order is entitled to price match for the new order."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anybody sign up for the UPS MyChoice?
When I try to sign up they ask for my address, but I cannot change the country to Singapore, it's fixed as USA

Posted from PCWX using POCOPHONE F1"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Don’t use mobile, just go for laptop browser for sign up delivery status will do"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ah okok thanks bro
Posted from PCWX using POCOPHONE F1"
Lenovo Thinkpad,so fast deliver the mouse and bag i think
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ya. Within 2 days
Lenovo Thinkpad,yup got it. thanks!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Haha mine also , receiving on 19th Aug.
Bag and mouse only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Are u going to install Linux on ur lappy?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No just remain as Win 10, cause never use linux before , I have many software is supported by windows only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I see. I am currently using macOS, prefer Linux/unix kind of system. Windows not really my thing"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"So many years used with MAC OS , I felt that windows more suitable for me.
Cause I can do more thing than MacOS."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Mine ship on 24th 😍
Lenovo Thinkpad,I received my mouse and bag liaooo
Lenovo Thinkpad,Same by today
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It really depends on your usage. For most folks, 8GB is more than sufficient, so 12GB is good enough."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Even though the rams are not the same size, it will still run in dual channel. Its not like the old days where you need to get matched pair of rams in order to run them in dual channel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Not aware of that or else I would have picked the Ryzen 7 CPU with 8GB soldered on. Haizzz
Lenovo Thinkpad,What did u picked?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My P1 Gen 2 comes with 64gb ram , open 3 revit model and one autocad 2018.
The ram for 16gb more than enough."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Whoa the specs are 🔥🔥🔥 The ram comes in 2 x 32 GB sticks or did you upgrade yourself cos its v ex to go with customised option on site.. Asking cos I am thinking of buying 32gb ram sticks but cnt find
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yup, I’m customised on site, 32gb single stick still can get.
Samsung or SK Hynix only. But the price for single stick included shipping around $300 each can consider upgrade your new SSD.
Show you recent 1TB SSD speed from Lenovo. They used Samsung PM981a OEM.
The speed is incredible 😍😍"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ryzen 5 and 32 GB loh
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone got shipping updates for T495s yet? I did not get any update so far.
Lenovo Thinkpad,The laptop will only arrive on 29 August.
Lenovo Thinkpad,My T495 just got shipped out of the Hebei factory. Waiting for UPS to update on the scheduled date in Singapore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,My also shipped out already
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Why we all order at same day , my ship out on 24th Aug for T495 🤔🤔"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Depends on config and availability of parts?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Haha , I think so, cause mine has maximum customised , just except on 32gb Ram."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Mine too. My one also 23rd then sent out for delivery
Lenovo Thinkpad,There is one section when ordering where there's red text that said sent after 2 weeks . Maybe they are waiting for stocks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just checked again, mine not shipped yet. Anyone else ordered T495s instead of T495 here?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Just got mine for t495 lol 😝
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone has good recommendation for M.2 PCIe SSD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Got many Adata SX8200 Pro
WD SN750
Intel 760P
SP A80 silicon power
Samsung 970 evo plus
Samsung PM981 or PM981a OEM"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks for the recommendation. Gonna read up some comparison then decide which to get.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wasted. Missed the National Day Promo for T495
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all,
For the T495,
I would like to ask, can the SSD be partition eg: 512GB into 2 drives eg C: drives, D:drive? Thnks!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Sure Can , try to watch from YouTube 😍"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi obichacha,
Thnks for the enlightenment!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My Thinkpad is E495. So now I can't get M.2 2280 SSD, have to get 2242. But options are limited. It seem Toshiba is offering it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,The shipping is delayed? Now shipping on 5 Sept.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"When will shipping date be available usually? I ordered on 14 Aug after follow up on the bug on 9 Aug. Received the mouse and case today. However, still no date on the 'expected to ship' field in the order status."
Lenovo Thinkpad,You can try to contact Lenovo
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not much choices now.
Can get from Taobao 512gb by Lenovo
I have buy from Taobao, if u want can help u buy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,This time it's about 1 month. Maybe no stock.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"What can do?
Wanna get cheap and good specs , just wait will do.
Mine estimate ship out on 30Aug, just got updated."
Lenovo Thinkpad,didn't know that until today. on both Intel and AMD platform?
Lenovo Thinkpad,My shipping postponed from 19 August to 11 September
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My still on the way.
No change in date.
Specs wise different that's why probably faster."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Mine arrived in Singapore this morning but scheduled delivery is still end of 22 Aug Thur.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Which model?
Have u customised?
Why so fast."
Lenovo Thinkpad,T495. Customised. Ryzen 7.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks bud for the information. Can u PM the seller u bought from instead? I'm getting other stuff from TB as well. One if it is an ssd enclosure.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Haha never bought yet, you can do a search , they have plenty of seller. 🤣"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hello, can i ask if i want to extend my e595 to two monitors, do i REALLY need a docking station or is there an cheaper alternative?
Thanks in advance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Comes with HDMI port and PD type C for display port.
You need to buy display port / hdmi cable to type c cable for 2nd monitor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thank you, so in short, i need to buy one more cable right? sorry I am noob.
I know the dock is plug in and wala.

also, maybe dock is more neat?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Go shopee look at Baseus or Ugreen type C docking if you want.
But price is more or less $30>"
Lenovo Thinkpad,thank you! will go check it out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"whoa.. i'm surprised!
received my T495!
First impressions
- light
- material more premium than E series even the keyboard.
- speaker grill on the top versus below of E series
- the usb-c port on the left is slightly awkward.
- SSD is WDC not samsung
- out of box is 1809 windows. Should be I see wrongly, not 1803. Lots to update until you get to 1903.
Don't forget to load Lenovo vantage after that to load the rest of the stuff.
- highest nit screen seems like the correct choice."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"lol, i want to pull trigger then now like dun have second option of SSD for E495/595. sian"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi may I know what’s WDC ?
Never heard before 🤔🤔"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I think is western digital
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Western Digital, FYI they brought over Sandisk so some Sandisk SSD
products are identical with their WD counterpart."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"WD not bad wor, think to get their Black
SN750 for my backup drive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Sorry I have the question:
How many gigabyte you bought they packed with WD ssd?
Thanks"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Damn missed the ndp promo. Wait for bf sales
Lenovo Thinkpad,When is “bf” sale?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"What is the ndp promo? I missed out on it too.
Sent from lalaland using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Received my T495 yesterday evening. Factory installed OS Win 10 1809. Now installing and configuring the laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Black Friday sale on 29th Nov
Lenovo Thinkpad,"512gb, that's why shipped faster."
Lenovo Thinkpad,54% off for AMD selected models
Lenovo Thinkpad,Not just AMD processor models. T495 and T495s with AMD processors and Thinkbook 13s with Intel processors.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually I’m miss out to look at T495s lol.
Nvm.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Except for weight, I guess T495 is better since T495s max RAM is only 16GB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Maybe i refer to this thread , they all go for T495 and do upgrade all Max specs on 32GB ram. Probably is one of the reason."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I think for E595 isn’t that cheap?
Lenovo Thinkpad,What is the price for T495 after discount?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Less than 1.1k for mine
Lenovo Thinkpad,"54% will cost less than 2k.even if you hoot the highest specs. Jin song, and hard to come by offer."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The speed of the wdc SSD is slower than the samsung one..
FYI
i'm okay with it though, still speedy for me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"32gb is not possible for those who chose Ryzen 7.  Therefore if you max out the processor, iroNically you can't max out the ram."
Lenovo Thinkpad,But still better than T495s Max 16gb only 😆
Lenovo Thinkpad,The option to choose 2nd hard drive for E495 has been removed ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The thing is E495 without any ssd for selection.
If you has remove the HDD, is consider no come with any windows, u need to install by yourself with get Sata 3 2.5” ssd install your own."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Previously the option to choose 2nd hard drive was there.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Don’t seem they have 2nd option.
Maybe they no longer selling 2242 m.2 ssd"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all,
I know this idea might be far fetch and there is no harm trying.

I am one of those bros who missed out on the 54% off the T495 promo on 09 Aug.
I will be posting on Lenovo FB home page, to ask them can they consider bringing back the promo again for the upcoming IT show on 05th Sep.

Hopefully, with ppl supporting, Lenovo might consider bringing back the promo, of a similar discount.

Thnks for reading.
Wishing everyone a great weekend!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Default is 128GB SSD with no HDD selected. Do check using their online chat. This was what I was told in the online chat last week, but I did not confirm since just asking only"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I alps.missed. Will support if u post
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Probably they want to push the 2 day models, E495/E595 there is a SKU
that can be delivered within 2 days.
These SKU have SSD but not customization.
Or maybe they noticed, most opt for HDD than add in their own SSD.
Cheaper that way than going for Lenovo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I just realise that E495/595 if you come into customise they no Ssd for selected🤭
Most likely they force you to get from ADD packaged, then can enjoy the shipping time.
Price more or less are the same."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My 1TB SSD is of the make ""SAMSUNG MZVLB1T0HBLR-000L7""."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wow, how come u got your faster than us?
Mine still awaiting till 30/8 then ship out."
Lenovo Thinkpad,2 lane or 4 lane PCIE?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Samsung PM981.
Sorry is PM981a same as mine from P1 Gen 2.

Read write speed"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not sure bro.  My config was Ryzen 7 + 16gb + 1tb ssd + IR screen. Not sure if this affects the lead time. It was attempted delivery two days ago on Thursday 22 Aug but I was not home.  So I received on second attempt on friday 23 Aug.
As my three year on site was a manual addition by the CSO for 1 cent , I had to register the laptop - choose ""electronic"" at the bottom of registration screen instead of ""none"" or ""hardcopy"" - and enter a pin code and authorisation code sent via email for the three year on site."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Bro. Not sure.  I don't know how to check. Maybe I will check CrystalDisk later just finished vacuuming the floor and am very sweaty now
Good to know that there is a concept of lanes.  Tks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Meaning less ppls will get the Ryzen 7 pro model.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You’re the smarter"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Upgrade Liao, get Irobot Roomba or Roboking , my house using roboking , that’s very helpful for me"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"A few days ago, I have posted the request already in their FB to show interest.
At least we try to show Lenovo there is interest to revive the promo again. Although it will not be 54% discount, 20% or more discount is still better than nothing.
I hope there will be supporters for it, so the chance might be there.
Thnks for yr support in reading my post."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi Bro,
I would like to ask, after negotiation with the CS for the 1 cent, 3 yr on site warranty. Did you have to complete the payment process first, then provide the Lenovo CS your transaction no?
Can you pls share with me the steps of the procedure, so I know what to do when I intend to buy the T495? thnks!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi Bro
They will charge into your credit card , but in the pending status.
Until they shipped mouse or bag and withdraw the laptop amount from your card.
After they ship out the laptop then recharge again.
Mean you buy now and pay next month or another month, due to delay the shipping date."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks bro
On Aircon cool down cool down"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi obichacha,
Thnks!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks guys. Hope they put back the SSD option again
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes bro. You are right. In detail these steps were:
- I told CSO I will buy Ryzen 7 only if it came with three year on-site as an incentive/trade-off for Ryzen 7 not being able to configure 32gb
- He agreed and asked me to place an order without the three year on site. The order total was 1063.06 and card was charged for a unconfirmed amount of 1063.06.
- Thereafter, he could ""see"" my order and manually added mouse +laptop +three year warranty for ""free"".  However I could see that it was actually not free since it was one cent each and now my order total is 1063.06+0.03=1063.09.
- upon shipment, I my card was charged with 1063.09 instead of 1063.06."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi Bro,
thnks!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Guys for thinkpad if order online really takes a month before i can receive?
Do they have lenovo stores when i can grab and go? Coz im travelling soon and i need a laptop. I cant wait that long..
Where can i buy thinkpad models? I only see other lenovo models"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Try to visit Funan mall they have officially retail shop for you to grab on the spot.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Last week, I went to sim Lim to enquire for T495 models. They tld me models XX5 models online channel only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,The Funan mall have many choices
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i didn't take a month..
about 1 week plus ?
depends on the specs really, see avaliable parts."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Officially delivery is 2 weeks
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I'm planning to get E495 laptop in 1 or 2 weeks. Pls let me know how to get a good discount.
I did live chat, they offer me a 15% discount for 'PAYDAY' coupon and 5% rebate, total of 20%.

Try to talk to CS team to nego for $0.01 for 3 yrs on site warranty instead of 5% rebate.
You can calculate again, the $0.01 for 3 yrs on site warranty savings is a bit more than the 5% rebate."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone receive your T495 yet?
Lenovo Thinkpad,I received on 23 August.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Got mine today. 16 days lead time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lol 😆
just receive ups tracking today,"
Lenovo Thinkpad,So when will you get it? Mine will come next week.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all,
I am thinking of getting the T495
but I am not sure which option to choose
Should i get
1 AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 3700U Processor or AMD Ryzen 5 Pro 3500U Processor ?
2 14.0"" FHD 1920 x 1080, IPS, Anti-Glare, 300nits, Multi-touch or 14.0"" FHD 1920x1080, IPS, 400nits, Anti-Glare
I am mostly using for work and creation working using mostly Adobe illustrator and slightly use of Photoshop.
Hope you guys can help on this"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Get 3700U or 3500U come with 16gb Ram.
Actually no regret to add on from 400nits display.
Higher brightness will help u see clearly in dark area."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yup... probably next week will get it on hand.
Actually I just got my X395 on hand ,
Thinking to let go my T495 🤣🤣🤣"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lol,  why get so many? To sell?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"X395 for my Wife actually, she don’t want and give me used.
My T495 waiting too Long.
What can do? No point to keep many right!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,First impression with Vega 8 - can play CS:GO medium settings at 60 FPS on 1080p monitor. Much better than Intel integrated graphics.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"ThinkPad bring nice specs for us.
I am love it so much"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually 300 nits is already very bright. Most of the time, you likely will only be using to close to 150 to 200 nits. Even for outdoor, 300 nits with a matt screen will work. 400 nits in the dark is too bright especially when sitting very close to the laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hahah, get the most highly brighter you have no regret.
At least can adjust as you want.
Yup exactly 300nits is good than enough."
Lenovo Thinkpad,300 nits is not bright enough fo some. There are other laptops with 500 nits.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For me 250nits display brightness is something too dim, try to get higher as you can. 😂"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for all your ans I roughly knows what to get.
I wait for this week PC shows see if there is additional discounts on Lenovo website before getting a purchase."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you are using it for Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, it's better to get the non-touch screen with 400 nits brightness.
The multi-touch panel with 300 nits brightness has only 45% color gamut while the non-touch panel with 400 nits brightness has 72% color gamut."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Received my set this morning. The T495 is a great improvement from the E585 in terms of build quality.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"How come nobody use the small business sign in to get 20% discount...
Can use shopback somemore"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Cause nobody has company. 🤔🤔
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yup, whoever take 250nits to 300nits the Color too bright and dim.. don’t really get the corrected Color for the overall views.
Just except on 400nits come with 72% of gamut. This is help a lot for viewing in photos editing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"We bought when there is 54% discount plus using shopback, there's another 100 plus."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Get the highest nits, cause the color is the best for the options I think.
I using the brightest so far I find it good for the price."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can someone share where is the best place and method to buy ThinkPad ?   Through Lenovo website itself/online malls/physical electronics store/IT shows?
I'm thinking of extending their 1year base warranty to 3 years which seem to be the pricing sweet spot. Slightly confused by the 3 different upgrades: Carry-In, Onsite, Premier OnSite.
which wty upgrade do you guys recommend?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Online is the best place.
Physical store wise, you cannot configure the specs to your liking and
not able to use promo codes.
- Carry in means anything wrong with the laptop, you have
to carry it to the service center. Which is in Paya lebar for what I know.
- Onsite means anything wrong they come down to fix
- Premium Onsite this warranty is suitable for business than home users.
What this means is expect ""Next day"" service without waiting for parts and etc.
Onsite warranty will do fine for home users unless you are buying to use at
work than get Premium onsite.
The type of Warranty also applies to other manufactures like Dell and HP."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for the very informative reply on warranties!
btw, how do you guys ask for further discount from the CSO? Do they give discount on top of whatever eCoupon code alr on web sitite? e.g. 'TECHSHOW' at the moment"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Have to wait for others to comment.
I am here to share my comment/suggestion since most
here have never used AMD based laptop before."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"plus shopback lor
5% more"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anybody order the X395? Is it good enough for basic usage? Browsing.. Travelling.. Ms office...
Sent from OnePlus GM1900 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If i install a ssd after choosing dummy hdd in the config, will i void the warranty?
Sent from Samsung SM-T720 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yup , I have X395 for my current toy.
This is great laptop, battery life’s more than 10 hours.
Everything can do, such as doing the design work or engineering or light architecture model from autodesk Revit or autocad or some contractor software as well.
The best part is cpu fan rarely kick in.
Make you u add on 16gb ram and 300nits display will do.
Currently installed the HD clear screen protector looks like glossy as X1 Carbon HDR display.


Also applied carbon sticker to avoid scratches"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Dummy hdd they will remove the Sata cable.
Unless you leave it as 5400rpm hdd.
Nope they won’t void your warranty cause you didn’t touch the rest like CPU or motherboard parts else."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"so does anyone think the COMEX offers are good/worth?  or is online order still better priced?
btw, when you guys mention ShopBack here, you all referring to the coupon code @ shopback.sg?
how do you guys ask for more discount through CSO on top of coupon code?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Take note COMEX and retail shops don't carry AMD laptops
like Thinkpad E495/E595.
If you are looking at Intel based laptop with better pricing than
head down to COMEX."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"what is your config? Im looking at base model with 2day delivery
Sent from OnePlus GM1900 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I think almost near to full specs
Lenovo Thinkpad,"where can i get the sata cable?
like this one -"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"what discounts did you apply for your purchase?
did it take very long to arrive? The customized ones indicate 'Ships in more than 4 weeks' while the 2-days delivery one pre-configured abit too basic for my needs"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Sorry which is your model?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yup you need to play awaiting games more than 3-4 weeks after you place your ordered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi obichacha,
Can you advise where you bought the carbon stickers and how much it cost? thnks!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"how much after discount?
i had another order from a dealer in carousell...
X390 intel model i5 16gb ram .. @$1650... best price i believe than waiting for 3weeks haha"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can get from AliExpress
Key in carbon sticker will do"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I order from when during the sales , around $1700 for my X395."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi obichacha,
Tnks!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"shopback upsized to 9% til 9th sep
talk to online cso, might get 20% off and 0.10 for 3 yrs warranty. all depends on which cso..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyone have issues with missing keystrokes on E495? Think this issue was there with E495 until a BIOS update fixed it.
Any idea if this happens on T495 and X395 as well?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Everything should be solve after windows 1903 version with Lenovo vantage update will be going well
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Probably when I buy, I will try my luck and upfront request CSO for $0.10 for 3 yrs warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,just say u saw it bundled with some systems
Lenovo Thinkpad,"difficult to smoke leh.. they will ask which system and they can check their internal system as well.
Will just have to try luck lor"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Got mine yesterday too
But this is the intel model i5-8365u x390...

Sent from OnePlus GM1900 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can’t wait your battery reviews
Mine fully charged can last more than 8-10 hours by AMD Ryzen Pro 3500U"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"When i try customize E495 or E595, it doesn't have the option to customize the 2nd hard drive because i want ssd + hard drive combo.
They only have option to choose what capacity hard drive you want only.
Ridiculous
fooking lame. Like that need to wait brack friday"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"actually i didn't smoke, just said i saw it bundled with some of their deals and he said ok almost immediately. i was surprisingly shocked too
just told me to order, state order no and he will price match"
Lenovo Thinkpad,ok. I will try my luck when I order. thnks!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone has any idea whats the difference between 45W and 65W charger? Will it really charge faster? Looking at E595.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Charge faster, especially needed for E585"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For some reasons, this option is gone. Try to buy outside, it should be cheaper too, and you'll have more options."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Get 65w instead of 45w charger
Lenovo Thinkpad,was told they do not have stock
Lenovo Thinkpad,"got offer again for 9.9 - TODAY only
now considering whether to get X395 or T495s
which is better ah ?
priced at 1144 and 1422 respectively
ryzen 5 pro 3500u
16gb ram
256gb ssd
backlit kb
65w adapter
3 year premier support wty
same weight at 1.28kg
the only hardware difference is the IPS 300 nits ~ 400 nits and WWAN
13.3"" and 14"" display not alot of difference right ?
sibeh jialat ... dilemma liao"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"tried to ask for $1 3Y Onsite and got rejected lol.
Oh well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not much different.
13.3 vs 14 inch display lol
From the viewing angle on 14” slightly wider than the 13.3” display only.
The height both are the same."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Same.
But well the discount is rather good, already pulled the trigger on a x395 base model.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"is there any overheating issues with these processors?
planning to get ryzen 5 pro 3500U for coding in Visual Studio .NET and MSSQL"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"So many users here, nobody complains has overheating issue.
To be honest AMD far better than the Intel 8th gen cpu, cause power saving and less fan on."

Sorry, just to check.. am new to AMD stuff.
I dont really understand the configuration.
Earlier up the list it says INTEGRATED GRAPHICS,
But later at the end it says AMD RADEON VEGA 6 GRAPHICS.
So what can i expect the laptop to come with?
Is the Radeon vega 6 the default integrated graphics?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The vega graphics is considered integrated gpu I think, like the intel 630 graphics on the i7 9750H  line"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ok got it!
Thks for the info!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"for t495, onboard or added ram better?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Max out the onboard since its not user up-gradable , the added ram can install yourself."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Max it 16gb onboard, in future can add another 16gb by yourself"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Don’t take TN panel, you will regret"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"thx guys!
10 char"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Many generations have passed, Athlon Era like Athlon XP tend to overheat.
Ryzen is a completely new CPU, DIY space it is selling very well.
Need not worry about overheat but Intel will be a different story."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Depend on your budget, best onboard + added ram for dual channel.
That means 8 X 2 or you can get onboard 8GB than buy from outside additional RAM."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just pulled the trigger on T495. Around $1150 if shopback is successful.
The sales were really really tight, they won't budge on adding extra % or freebies. It's going to be my first Thinkpad"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Double9 sales for today only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"actually with the 39% off, think cheaper to get from lenovo, no?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Additional crucial 16gb ddr 4 selling $85-90.
But if come with onboard either 8 or 16gb make sure added to max."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Oh yes the current 9 9 sale, better take advantage of it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Already ordered bro.. haha..
Anyway i like my screens dark.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hahah, dark is ok, just a bit grey color.
Cause TN panel just come with 45% gamut only"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Suggest you to cancel the order and get the Full HD IPS panel instead.
Or ask CSO whether can change the order or not.
TN screen not only dark but the LCD panel picture quality is worse
than IPS panel.
It's up to your preference anyway."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Haha I had my previous experience, i always adjust the color setting to suit from my eyes, end up sold the whole laptop.
Cause really cannot take it.
Looks sometime my eyes very uncomfortable.
Actually in this thread can found many previous user they asking about replace to IPS panel as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeah i understand what u mean.
My requirements for screens are very basic..
So probably wont bother me that much."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Any major differences between X395 and T495 that I should take note of? Looking at these configurations.

Price is like 10 dollar differences, but seems quite similar to me.
Mainly using for school, some data modeling and simulation."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"From your customised.
X395 is lighter and better battery life also 300nits display.
T495 battery life around 7 hours full charged and slightly heavy weight.
Screen wise 250nits not as good as X395."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thank you so much obichacha! Okay, I think I will go ahead with the X395 since I'll be carrying it out a lot and battery life matters quite a bit more to me. Thank you for taking your time to give the spec sheet! Very helpful."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all,
Just placed my order for T495, this would be my 1st Lenovo Thinkpad.
Hope it does not disappoint.
Thnks to obichacha suggestion to choose the 400 nits option, so can have options to adjust the brightness.
Over the weekend, I went to comex to see the difference between 250, 300 , 400 nits.
I used the T490 300 nits and E490 250nits display unit as a reference, I found the 250 nits too dim. Since Lenovo today, have a decent discount, decided to take the 400 nits option.
Most impt it was still within my budget.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Even before I wanted put in request for $0.10 and $1 for 3yr onsite warranty.
The CS immediately told me $72.50 is best price already.
I believe alot ppl were requesting for it as well.

The CS sounded very pissed off when I was persistently pestering her to consider my request."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Great specs, hope after you will enjoy the laptop, cause fully customised by your own.
Actually Lenovo very smart, the display from 250, 300 nite they product as 45% of color gamut, only 400nits come with 75% of true color.
Cause we spend more time to looks from the display right, should go for the most comfortable one. 🤭"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Something fingerprint missing 🤔🤔
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hm. Don't think I will use it so I didn't take. What's wrong?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Nope, there is just $15 only, if I didn’t get wrong.
Cause it's damn fast to unlock it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yah, $15 before discount. After discount its like $9ish.
Now I feel like I want it.
I already ordered can change easily?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Go support for live chat
Lenovo Thinkpad,No shopback this time round except for selected models.
Lenovo Thinkpad,So they will eventually deny this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i just bought this hehe
hope it's a good buy
i wanted to get T495s wan but then my friend say 1.4k for T495s
might as well get X395 @ 1.18k"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Which model do you bought?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Got the T495. Shopback didnt mention any specific model, it just directs you to their site right?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Shopback has been very strict many years back already.
There could be a chance, the cashback could be rejected also.
Although my cash back was tracked, I am mentally prepared for my cashback to be rejected. Try to treat cash back as a bonus,  fingers crossed, our cash back can be accepted."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can confirm X395 can get cashback from shopback. Those buying remember use shopback its on 9% cashback right now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone got movement on yesterdays order?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Based on the past feedback in the forum, from those who bought with 54% off.
The mouse and laptop bag would arrive first followed by the Laptop separately.
Since Lenovo, indicate 2 wks lead time, we have to patiently wait.
Some even had their laptops after 4 weeks.
Since this was a sale, our shipment could be even longer than lead time due to surge in volume."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Now they set the shipping period to 4 weeks, so long! I hoot 5 sets for my Company now have to tell the guys to wait 1 month and see all their disappointed faces."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"lol ok lah , good things must wait
anyway i not in the hurry also cos i still have my x280"
Lenovo Thinkpad,4 weeks for production and delivery is not acceptable in this age. They need to buck up their production line. Lol! Lol!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"too bad they dun sell in their retail stores.
those peeps who cannot wait wan can buy off the shelves.
i heard x95 series stores dun carry"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi, Can check where to get the screen protector? and you cut the carbon sticker by yourself? Looks nice."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya, my screen protector bought from AliExpress, try to get 15.4 inch ThinkPad model. Carbon sticker also from AliExpress.
Just diy cut to fit.
But I get to used , cause I had done few ThinkPad already.
Links showing the photos diy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,that sticker after u tear off will leave any residue boh ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"just wondering why lenovo never give us the choice to choose black or silver color for the laptops
i saw lewis's X1C 6th gen, that silver / dark grey damn nice sia"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Refer here, over a year after tear off without any sticky glue on surface."
Lenovo Thinkpad,This time X1 C7 no longer available for silver color.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"So these estimated ship dates are blank is normal?
Or should it straight away display after payment?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wait after next month
Lenovo Thinkpad,"normal lah, after u place order liao....next day or 2 will reflect shipping dates liao"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wah, your laptop eta 17 Oct. Mine don't even have a date yet. I also ordered a X395."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"never own a thinkpad before, any recommendation for one without breaking the bank?
I basically need it for surfing, youtube etc. and some light gaming like CS go only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yah lor why they need so long also. not as if they got no stock for parts,
lelomo very big company leh

anyway i not in rush to get it. i still have 2 thinkpads at home haha"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"AMD based laptop usually are not sold in retail channel.
For business/education, reseller/distributor also reluctant to quote AMD laptop.
That leave only online store as the only place to buy AMD laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all, just nice wanted to buy a laptop for my work usage. Is this the minimum setup I should consider for x395? I'm using for basic word processing, and occasionally image processing needs like illustrator and photoshop.
Processor : AMD Ryzen 5 pro
Operating System : Windows 10 HOME Should I go for Pro version
Memory : 8GB DDR is 8GB sufficient
Hard Drive : 256GB SSD
Display : 300nits
Power Cord : 65W AC Adapter 65W instead of 45W for faster charging?
Thanks in advance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think that 16GB RAM good for future since can't add on any more
Win 10 pro not necessary you need it, but RAM you need it more than Windows upgrade."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks for the suggestion. Seems like I missed the 9/9 deal. Currently it's 1.5k with all the listed specs. May wait and see if there's 10/10 sale available.
Lenovo Thinkpad,most likely it's 11.11
Lenovo Thinkpad,sad just missed the deal also
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If AMD is improving in performance, why is there the reluctance?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Many factors:
- There is still perception that AMD CPU is slow and hot
- AMD OEM products don't sell well so most don't carry
- Most prefer Intel than AMD
Walk into any retail shop, if you ask their opinion about AMD laptop
they will quote the above.
For Ryzen to rise in OEM/Retail channel may take time, since
AMD reputation over a decade isn't that good.
I myself the only user who uses AMD since
Turion Mobile-> Phenom Mobile -> AMD APU Era A Series Mobile
Last time it's very hard to find AMD laptop and there is no online
store to buy such laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyone know the SSD is MLC/ TLC/ QLC?
Mine is WDC SN520. Cannot find the SSD type in WD website."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Found here is TLC
Can replace for Samsung 970 Evo Plus in future, I think doesn’t bigger issue"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am going to try out AMD for the first time, so hope the experience will be good.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Make sure to get Ryzen Pro 3500U or 3700U to save your time
Lenovo Thinkpad,"knn lelomo says my bag and mouse arriving on 17th. then ups today wanna deliver to me
i am not at home"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"so this ""512GB M.2 2280 NVMe TLC OPAL"" from lelomo is using what brand wan"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"pro and non-pro , very big difference ah ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"In the specs for E series didn’t mentioned on Pro.
But T & X has Pro, I’m confused 😐"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Those OPAL is Samsung PM981A, I did share before"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Don't worry like obichacha shared, get either Ryzen 5/7 for best performance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"oic , so this one should be fast la. then no need for me to buy 970 pro"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Performance wise between both is more or less the same.
Only pro chips have security features and longer part availability."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"just asking if this X395, can it plug in e-gpu ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"All AMD models doesn’t had thunderbolt from Intel device, wait for next gen USB 4.0 combine with thunderbolt 3."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"oic ok. then i will just use this a netflix and net browsing lol
use back my desktop haha"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lol 😂 🤣🤣 you are Right
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yah anyway i am big fan of thinkpads
so buy one more if got super sale also ok wan
i currently have 2 thinkpads
X1 yoga and X280
once u try a thinkpad u never look back.
other high end laptops like mbp, lg gram, alienware - all cannot fight with thinkpad's keyboard and durability"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Got an ETA for my laptop.
Also got my mouse and laptop bag delivered today."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ai yah.
Wasted to hoot 512GB from lenovo. Should get the 128GB and upgrade to Samsung 970 Evo Plus."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I thought they bundle with Samsung PM981a , that's fast enough."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is the x395 a good buy? The battery is rated around 10+ hours?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all!
A future x395 owner
waiting for delivery ETA 19 Sept
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT
edited: turns out..my company bought the T495s"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"User here, from 8-10 hrs not an issue"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Excellent. Planning to get the x395.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"same here, just got updated last night.
The accessories were shipped from hongkong though UPS, my colleague ordered couple of weeks back and were shipped through Tiong Nam which I think were locally stocked. Looks like a lot of people purchased during the sale.
Hopefully the laptop is delivered earlier than the estimate, probably next week if it's really within 2 weeks shipped from the order date. The UPS tracking for the accessories says today will be delivered by end of day."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Haiz, kept hesitating to place order during 9.9. in the end gave it a miss...now a bit regret lol
Sent from Xiaomi REDMI NOTE 5 using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I got the same delivery date as you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Reviews
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wait for 10.10 or 11.11?
Electronics price will keep dropping.
Buy only when you need it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,thanks for the link. Been looking for new reviews for the T495!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can check for X395 is the maximum ram I can put onboard is 16GB. I cant add on more RAM ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"16gb onboard, must be configured before you check out."
Lenovo Thinkpad,weird uh...seldom see x395 reviews
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks Obichacha can I add above 16GB by myself ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Only left E495 and X395 review.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I got YouTube reviews , do you want?
But for X395 only"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can’t, X395 or X390, T490s and T495s or X1 Carbon 7th gen all comes with onboard, meaning the Ram is soldered onboard.
Actually the idea is come from macbook 🙊"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i saw some but no sound wan lol then got 4 parts video damn shaky
show me urs"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lol not posted yet 😂😂😂
Got here only"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hello! Me too.
You ordered during 9.9 sales?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"just ordered 16GB RAM and delivered within 2 hours.

should be compatible based on their site:"
Lenovo Thinkpad,How much where do u order?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"$115 from Amazon Prime Singapore. The unit itself is from Convergent Systems who is the official distributor, so no worries about the warranty.
I was looking around for the cheapest one, found on shopee but it looked dodgy they priced them at $104 only.
Took a look around qoo10 and lazada from reputable stores like  video-pro and convergent systems and it was around $120-$130ish.
I read something about the AMD Vega consuming some RAM and also better with dual channel. Didn't think of this when configuring the system during the sales, so ordered separately just now.
At lenovo site the 16GB addon was additional $180, but with the 39% will be $110.
so not much diff buying it separately  fortunately."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Bought mine from Taobao, included shipped around $90"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is there a noticable performance boost with dual channel?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually can’t feel like changed ssd from lower speed to high end speed.
Ram help for multi-tasking and open/close more faster with runs more software at same time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just nice got IT fair promo
So hoot online custom config + shopback
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Their ""reason""....
Less movable parts = thinner laptop
OH PLEASE.......
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"looks like the Lenovo mouse and bag would be delivered on 14th Sep.
Status indicated cleared HK customs check already."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"ok lah fair enuff.
soldered on board = thinner = which is true
u won't wanna see ur note 10+ be as thick as a laptop
cos there is 1 physical RAM slot on the mobo lol"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"mine shipped and delivered within 2 days.
why can't they do the same for the machine lol
Lelomo very big company leh"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Any idea about the heat? Is there any heat problem especially if it's gonna be left running like 24/7 constantly
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Of course there is hotter and warm on palmrest, even you left it inside the aircon room.
Even tho intel models"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Suggest go for desktop than laptop if you intend to run 24/7.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yah desktop if u wanna run 24/7.
i never off my pc before since i built it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Have you clean those dirt on all fan blade?
Lenovo Thinkpad,i got filters on my casing. so i just need to change filter nia
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Either put air filter or buy air blower
Which can be brought at Challenger."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Nice 👍 feel like a server
Lenovo Thinkpad,Desktop will have higher power consumption  esp when you leave it powered on 24/7
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can choose power supply with lower watts or down clock
Posted from PCWX using POCOPHONE F1"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"There is power efficient desktop that uses Intel T series.
But these desktop are rather pricey.
AMD also have power efficient under Ryzen E series.

However that is exclusive to OEM and cease to exist anymore.
Since with their new 7nm CPU, it is much power efficiency."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No, the lower/higher wattage power supply has been debunked. What you need is a power supply that is more efficient. Look at the efficiency curve with your usage if you want to save every last watt.
Downclocking will lower power consumption but ultimately laptop will still draw less power. It depends on what you are doing with the laptop turned on 24/7 and your use case anyways."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ah, I am unaware of that T series chip.
Either ways, I see no reasons why laptops cant be used as 24/7 rigs. If anyone is concerned about heat, a laptop that has good thermal design can efficiently remove the heat produced and will have no problem running 24/7. As for battery degradation, get a lenovo/asus idk if asus does it as well, there are ppl who say it does. do your research if you intend to go with asus and turn on conservation mode to allow the laptop to draw power from the wall instead of the battery."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Are you work in IT 🤔🤔
Why keep laptop run on 24/7?
Anyway just remove that battery will do."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Some of the laptops, the battery can't be removed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,My issue with Asus is that the chio zenbook uses fan-less cooling and non-removeable batt. Motherboard overheated despite low usage. Now its an expensive paperweight.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lenovo can disable battery, make sure plug in power adapter for all time, following remove out the battery."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes some laptop the battery cannot be removed.
Brand like Dell, you can set the laptop to run from AC.
But even so, the battery will wear out overtime."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"So sad I missed the deal, even though I got the E595 earlier. I am not happy with the E595, might consider a change."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can you share that E595 can install the NVMe PCIe ssd instead of m.2 ssd
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Nope not me, another forumer asking if should use laptop or desktop for 24/7 ops
I replied saying laptop will work fine too"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"While this is true, however a desktop is generally more efficient in getting things done since it runs much faster, and can then go back to idle mode. Moreover, you don't have to get a very high end desktop with high power PSU. Its possible to setup an Ryzen 2400G rig with a 150W power supply."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Just received the mouse and topload laptop bag.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"turns out my company ordered the T495s and not the x395
just received it this morning"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Received the accessories too or with the laptop?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yeap came with the LAN docket I ordered.
65W power brick in order to have that ""fast charge"" ability"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am assuming you ordered way before the 9.9 sales?
how long it took for you to receive the shipment email from the date of ordering? and how long did the shipping took to reach you?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My T495 delayed to 03 Oct. typical Lenovo. LOL
Guess this the norm for T495 sales order."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"according to my finance....
placed order on 9.9
12.09 got shipping order.
supposed to received on 18 but we were surprised it came in this morning"
Lenovo Thinkpad,probably they prioritize the same specs bulk/ biz orders.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"probably. anyway... IT guy not around to set the laptop up today for admin access.
but the laptop IS REALLY NICE.
the laptop hinge has been re-designed to allow single finger to lift the screen open"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Pls help to take a photo of your T495 for sharing. Thnks!
Lenovo Thinkpad,Really? Why X395 can’t do that.. still need to hold on body then lift the screen up
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am surprised that the single hand opening is possible with T495s.
I have seen a fair bit of T495s reviews and i don't remember any of them talking about t495s single hand opening.
I only remember Lew unboxed therapy talking about it with the X1 carbon 7th gen
oh! and the red ""i"" lits up too haha!

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi Bro,
Thnks for sharing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ugreen 65w usb c pd charger on Lazada can charge t495s?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If your t495s is still under warranty, try not to use 3rd party power brick cuz it will Auto void the warranty
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anker 100W Pd4 can charge also, just draw from 65W max current only.
there is same as iPhone 18W Pd an even 65W still chargeable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"There is depending, cause thunderbolt 3 can supply 100W Pd for any laptop, if this one Lenovo claim can’t use , mean all those Intel model no longer has thunderbolt 3 port connection already"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I will always suggest to check with Lenovo especially if your laptop is pretty new with valid warranty
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"BTW I’m first time to heard about use with 3rd party power adapter can be void the warranty.
Even tho self replace SSD/Ram they can void your warranty as well.
Anyway those PD power delivery is varies current supply’s
Except those old sch type power brick can only use with the original one, due to 3rd party can’t given 100% accurately voltage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"He probably meant if there is a power surge, it is not covered under warranty"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Just received my laptop bag + mouse from UPS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyway just use whatever you can.
I have no comments, cause since I did mine quite sometime already.
So far so good, I use with xiaomi & ugreen and Anker PD as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyway if you worry about that, please do with live chat and get the proper result.
Lenovo will help you to clarify."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"this is what I meant. using an unauthorized 3rd party charger always have the risk to cause damages to the laptop.
and if the damage prevents the laptop from powering up or display weird issues, Lenovo has the right to charge for servicing or even decline to service the laptop.
anyway.... it is always the consumer's own risk to use 3rd party products which are not approved by the company, especially charger."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Off course your company laptop, company not allow mean don’t use any 3rd party, settle."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"just a quick update on the battery life
I started t495s @ 100%, running on wifi around 7:20pm. Power mode I switched to ""AIRPLANE"". Brightness 6/10. Keyboard backlight OFF.
Eye care mode OFF, setting is +1 towards COOL
Tasks:
- internet surfing
- email replying
- replying to HWZ forum
Time Check: 8:51pm battery left: 82% 5hrs, 15mins left"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"it has nothing to do with ""company"" or ""personal"" laptop. for laptops, I will use the official charger provided.
and maybe its just me...
anyway.... different people, different POV, that's all.
the laptop is yours... you wanna use 3rd party laptop charger to power up your brand new laptop... by all means."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, laptop is mine, I did with my previous laptop more than 3 years hasn’t issue.
Unless you buy the cheapo brand charger.
For me I had no issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Generally I feel it will be fine as long as you are not using some brandless and cheapo Type C charger. I've been using my E485 with Type C PD chargers from Aukey and Xiaomi for more than 6 months now, and its fine."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually I been used Xiaomi 65W highly recommended by HWZ , in real life xiaomi laptop also come with that original 65W PD for xiaomi laptop.
It’s fine for me. Just except my ThinkPad P1 workstation could not use lower than 135W power supply."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The Lenovo original 65w adaptor is already small enough. The cable also long enough.
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"wao kao, the delivery date became 17th October lol
i bought my x280 & x1 carbon 6th gen
both customised was delivered within 2 weeks.
is this x395 too cheap for them to process faster"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Believe me nowadays X395 overwhelming than the T495 😅🤣🤣🤣
Cause it’s lightweight laptop and affordable price, performance wise is damn good.
Just don’t complain about the chassis and quality of surface very plastics feel, can get scratches easily.
Even tho that shipping box container can leave a mark on lcd front cover. 😑"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"any lobang where to get evo plus 1tb on the cheaper side? local stocks are around $450++
and are you 'Benefon' by any chance? there's a lot of similarities lol.
wow. 17th october, is it still within the stated shipping estimate on their product page?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Got, can get from China TB only
Nope that benefon is phototype 🙊😂😂😬"
Lenovo Thinkpad,How much did the 1TBs costs?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you wish to use third party charger,
No one is stopping you from doing so.
But laptop usually have specific charger to be used with it.
Wattage, current have to be within specs to power the laptop.
Else it will affect many components like mainboard and battery.
Mainboard is the most costly to replaced.
Lenovo themselves have their own power bank for Thinkpad but pricey.
As well as there is docking station that uses Thunderbolt or USB to be powered.
I know some don't like to carry the power adapter.
If can carry one universal charger for  everything that would be better.
Sorry to say this, please don't treat laptop like smartphone.
Smartphone you can play around with different charger. Laptop wise you have to be careful."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"$3XX included shipping loh
Pm me we go another room"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"the link u showed is 45W, is there a 65W model?
ps - ok, i found it"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"AliExpress got 65W model.
But can't show the link here 😘
Even tho shopee also have"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yes, i googled and saw a few
thanks"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think will wait for Black Friday and see if the prices go down. Currently on Amazon Prime, the 1TB costs S$304 with free shipping.
There's one 65W GaN chargers, one of them is SlimQ on indiegogo. Their plug is the US 2 pin unretractable though. But if you look at the form factor, it really is slim like a mobile phone charger.
The thing that worries me about these chargers from ugreen, baseus, slimq, xiaomi are their safety certifications.
Are they really safe? and are they certified?
Those 2 pin plugs somehow looks less safe than the 3 pin plugs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya almost that price, you can look for WD sn750 slightly cheaper to compare with 970 Evo Plus.
I had done few of them, for those come with 65W PD supply, so far so good, cause Lenovo vantage can set on stop after complete charged.
There is no issue for me, if you worry better do not try.
For my case , if going for outdoor , I will bring my xiaomi 2pin 65W PD alone with me.
Just in case my laptop run out of battery.
At home can use that original 65W type C adapter to save your life.
Since it’s free come from the packaged."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hi guys, during customization, there's an option to choose the power cord. i chose the 65W thinking it will come with the 65W power adapter....did i make a mistake here?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yup come with 3 pin UK plug
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i meant changing the option on the power cord will change the power adapter too?
ps - just checked delivery status and yes, it's included. apologies for confusion lol"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Oops if you forgotten , when customised , didn’t selected from 45W to 65W Lenovo will save some money from your packaged
Those standard was 45W charger only"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"default is the 45W adapter. when you upgrade to the 65W, you get the 65W adapter.
Both of them use 3 pin UK plug, and USB-C on the other end.
So yes, you get the 65W power adapter."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya sia me too. Delayed 2 weeks.
It was by 1 Oct, now it's 14 Oct."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I saw Infinito Atrix shop at Funan carries X395 - Ryzen 3 around $1.2k
E595 - Ryzen 5 around $1.2k
That is the only place I saw carrying these models.
Did not see E495/T495."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My shipment date was 16 Sep push back to 17 Oct.
Call them they say part shortage heatsink and fan.  Thought this is normal parts."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"this is the X395?
My T495 thankfully still on 3rd Oct scheduled delivery.
Yeah it sounds kinda weird that they could have shortage of a common part."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lenovo XX5 models, online channels only"
Lenovo Thinkpad,sounds like bs to me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i saw that as well.... but the specs quite on the low side, thus the low price for x395"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Don't get me wrong, the unit sold at that shop the spec is so so.
But that is the only place you can have a feel of the unit itself.
Even next door Lenovo showroom don't have a demo set
for customer to have a feel.

If anyone want to buy, best would still be through online."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya went there a once, first time to touch and play with X1 Extreme and get and touch on keyboard.
This is great demo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i also went to both stores to see see look look
I was actually very very very disappointed with the Lenovo flagship store. SO MUCH Space but not all the product lines are on display..
like What the F**********"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Same here and I think most retailers/distributor won't carry/sell
AMD OEM products in retail shops.
There is perception about poor performance, heat issues as well
as poor popularity thus low sales margin.
I did ask some shops Not those at Funan, they recommend Intel instead."
Lenovo Thinkpad,sigh..... my asus netbook PC 1215b with AMD Brazos APU chip is still going strong and iirc it is the only netbook way back in 2011/2012 which can run games
Lenovo Thinkpad,Guys do check your shipment date.  It is improving for my case from Sep 16 to Oct now back to Sep 28.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"morning half-day working from home.

- Email, internet, word, ppt, excel
- Whatsapp PC version, Zalo PC version
at 1:05pm, battery at 42% 2 hr 15 min left on my t495s"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Is your screen the Privacy Guard enabled?
Also, anyone used corsair force mp510 nvme ssd? Compared to the 970 evo plus it looks more worth it for the price"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Get Trancend MTE220S, Silicon Power A80 or Seagate FireCuda 510 or Samsung PM981a, HP Ex950, WD SN750.
Corsair Feel like in cold door.
Anyway PM981a not bad one"
Lenovo Thinkpad,E495 review is out:
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I need to check if I have that function key button or not
Just take note that the Privacy Guard feature actually dims your screen by a lot

Lenovo Thinkpad,"I heard someone told me, can remove that pre-installed protector, at least the display itself is 400nits"

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Make sure you guys do not upgrade to Adata SX8200 Pro the ssd urself is double side. Due to tiny space, it’s not suitable for laptops user."

Sent from Samsung SM-G965F using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Is your own?
Have you try to convert the hdd into ssd?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I noticed that my credit card has not been charged yet for my 9.9 purchase. Already received the laptop  bag and mouse, x395 is supposed to arrive on 3 Oct. Does Lenovo only charges me when the laptop is shipped?
Sent from Samsung SM-G970F using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, somewhere they did mentioned that they will only charge once they have shipped."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Any idea whether the T495 fits a double sided ssd?
PM981a this is the OEM version of the 970 evo plus right? Whats the price range at and where to get them?
970 evo plus you can order from qoo10, the ship from korea for around $295 with coupon"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hi everyone, just ordered ThinkPad E495.
Just want to check can I buy another 16gb ram but different brand? Also, any recommendations for 256gb SSD.

Lenovo Thinkpad,oh different machine. i think the X395 all delayed
Lenovo Thinkpad,can i know what's the cost of this config?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I just checked my T495 ETA, still as per 1st delayed date of 04th Oct."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Total is $1264. Inclusive of the 3Y addon at $72.50, $1 bag and $1 mouse.
Used shopback too at 9%, so total will be $1150 if the cashback is approved."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can I check what’s the best alternative to ThinkPad x1 carbon gen 7.
Like one that’s not too overpowered and cheaper"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"noted, thx"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I just suggest Vaio s13
But the support..... Probably not at Thinkpad level
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No regret to get X1 C7 with HDR display.
At least the screen n keyboard is so awesome.
Once you go for ThinkPad, u never go with other Brand’s anymore."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lenovo shipping is getting very ridiculous. Who the fark wanted to wait for  more than 1 month later to receive their laptops? Are they crazy? This is the 2nd time they are doing that!
The first time, they wanted to compensate me with a portable HDD but till now there is nothing received from them till now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"What did you order? Custom specs? When?
How much delay?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i emailed them asking why taking so long...they never reply
i am like being ignored totally lol
waited 7 days for their replies but no response
so i went to their facebook kpkb.
now they say will get their team to get back to me
i told them my friend who bought the same model as mine. got it already
wait and see lor.
mine was pushed to the furthest date lol knn"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Placed order on 9 sep and estimated delivery on 14 Oct. Who can wait for so long for a laptop sia!
I advise you guys either buy in shop or buy other brands. Their way of doing business is dubious."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Its like theyre making each laptop individually by hand lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i think they seriously have a backlog of the popular model, maybe they won't dare to do big promo anymore...
i got 2 e595 slated to deliver early next mth but was delivered last week after updates."
Lenovo Thinkpad,u tried live chat?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wow!!! That's....
No wonder my office last minute changed from x395 to t495s

Lenovo Thinkpad,"The date keep changing for me, 3 Oct to 14 Oct and back to 3 Oct. I also received a notification from bank that my credit card was billed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"So your card just got billed today? I think that's a good sign, which means they are ready to ship it soon.
I saw threads on another forum that got their X395 orders cancelled by lenovo. Hopefully it won't happen to Singapore buyers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"What can do?
Mine is under half half situation now.
Either they cancel or send out soon.
Already keep more than 3 weeks from 29th Aug."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"their live chat also useless wan.
they are the one asking me to email
emailed liao, waited for 7 days no response, then i dulan went to FB straight away message them
only then they responded."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I received the below from BOC:
BOC: A Retail Purchase of SGD 1,027.76 was completed with your BOC Card -XXXX on 22092019, 11:25 at LENOVO SINGAPORE PTE N. Please call 1800-3385335 immediately if you have not authorized it."

Hopefully will get billed and update tomight"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Mine same as you, got tracking now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"With regards to the amount being charged..
Did u have any add-ons like the wireless mouse, carry case etc for $1.00?
Were they charged together with ur thinkpad?
Mine was just the thinkpad charge alone..
Wondering if they will charge another time separately."
Lenovo Thinkpad,The amount excludes the $1 mouse and $1 bag. So I supposed $2 was billed earlier.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ok thks for the info..
Lenovo Thinkpad,is this a new type of finish? never seen a 'glossy black' before
Lenovo Thinkpad,New model 😍😍😍😍
Lenovo Thinkpad,"if u have seen a glossy black piano b4....i think it's that kind of finishing
which will attracts 200% more fingerprints and smudges lol
i prefer the current one like x1c and x280
or the silver color matt one"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Rubber paint like X1 Carbon/ Extreme or P1, the surface not as good as normal black color for X395, T480 or T460s.
Due to a bit stick on dust."
Lenovo Thinkpad,tml shud be reaching sg liao
Lenovo Thinkpad,"what's the benefits of getting x395 than E495 apart from..
-military grade testing
-longer battery life
-lighter"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"E is entry so build quality is different than X series.
X is portable since it is 13"" compare with E at 14"".
Depend on your budget and preference whether light weight or.
T series you can consider as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"T series would be more expensive. Budget is around $1k.
I was thinking if it is cheaper to buy during Black Friday."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I will also recommend to head down to Funan Thinkpad store and physically try out the E series, X series, T series, W series
Try out the keyboard, the typing, the feedback, the travelling between keys.
Try out the screen, the viewing angles, touch screen, non touch screen. The built in privacy guard

Lenovo Thinkpad,How different is Lenovo E495 from Lenovo Ideapad S145 which was selling at $699 at last Comex. S145 has 256GB SSD and 2GB Geforce graphics card.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ideapad - Consumer
Thinkpad - Business
Thinkpad will be better than Ideapad, keyboard, mouse and etc.
But depend which configuration you are going for?
That spec you show isn't well balanced."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"okay, thank you. Actually after posting the pic, i went to look up and compare Thinkpad E495 vs Ideapad S145 and saw that E495 ius better than S145 in many aspects."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"ideapad keyboard cannot make it one.
later buy liao regret
thinkpad has the best keyboard of ALL laptops in the market"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"sigh, no updates on my order yet. I guess there is a chance it will be delayed further.
Is there an option to cancel? Let's say if the shipment date will be postponed again."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Call 800 600 1481 look for after sales.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Just received my X395
Lenovo Thinkpad,"was it shipped 2 days back?
that was quick.
what's your initial impressions of the laptop?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, it was shipped 2 day ago. Initial impression, ""light"" as compared to my Asus N53  I have not played with it yet. But it looks good"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"FB message them....
mine originally estimated to arrive on 17th Oct...
after i kpkb to them in FB.
The x395 is coming today. waiting for ups to deliver nia"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I did. They keep giving the template answers.
""Custom machines may take time depending on parts availability.""
Even messaged them directly through their site and they only quote the estimated shipping date. They even offered to ask the factory, but till today no updates from them.
on another unrelated topic, logitech mx master 3 is available for PO at shopee  at $169. They are offering $50 vouchers for the first 100 customers. I chat them and they said it's still valid.
Maybe you're also looking for a mouse to compliment your X395"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"oic. thanks but i dun use normal mouse wan
i have been using trackball mouse for nearly 18 years liao"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Does the x395 or T495 come installed with 4G LTE card slot? To put a sim card for connectivity.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Both is available, this is optional to add on in customized"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just loaded my t495s with the following program:
- Adobe PS
- Adobe Ai
- Adobe IDD
- Adobe Pr
I trialed with a 1.8GB PS file from my company server and it took around 2 minutes to open but after that... its VERY SMOOTH"

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Did you select or was the WWAN option selected?

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Oh, extra charge? I don't think i took that then. Guess this is a dummy sim card slot but somehow i can still take out the sim card tray."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The specs shows the slot behind is for microsd card too, which means probably its double sided slot.
Check the pic below the spec sheet:

Just got an update for estimates delivery date.
Damn sien wait almost one month.
I am not too sure can buy direct from US website then forward to vpost."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"when is your expected ship date?
uh, on August you said you had 3 thinkpads on the way lol which includes the P1 Gen 2.
also have you noticed the base price increase on the Singapore site? or does it only occur on the Malaysia site?
I've noticed that the upgrades are no longer $1 or $0.01, like the 3 Year Premier NBD and Onsite warranty upgrades.
Even the bags and mouse are additional $9 now"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Sg base price always damn expensive than the MY one.
Worth to buy only at National Day.
Regarding my P1 Gen 2 letting go soon.
So far I had my X395 for wife and me got the P1 , if already sold , I got nothing on hand, but hopefully the X395 will be on time after In early October.
To be honest MY premier also cover in SG.
Shouldn’t an issue to claim in Sg , like my previous dell XPS."

But seldom use them

On-site warranty need to wait for the parts and arrange available date for you.
Premier they come to check on-site after next day.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Have you tried ordering from Lenovo MY website ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes I did that, even tho pay via my Sg card and ship to JB address from friend"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wait.. Singapore card can be used on Lenovo Malaysia site?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Keke even on tomorrow Citi45 offer code
Just refer to another forum will update all"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Reason for letting go p1 gen 2?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Careless did the scratches on the body cover.
Not so obviously, but for me is not in prefect Liao"
Lenovo Thinkpad,but over MY side carry AMD?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"All the same, they do more offers X395, T495
Only, the rest like E495, E595 Sg Super cheap here."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Goodbye Intel: Thinkpad T495s with AMD Ryzen is the better choice for many users
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks.. Gonna look out for citi45 promo tomorrow.
Lenovo Thinkpad,No more good deal man.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"if there is anywhere that can buy insurance for thinkpad laptops...
i will definitely get it.
means i can drop as much as i want or get it stolen

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lol , drops is depend how you drop it from.
I didn’t drop before, just recently in MY offers few selected model RM1 for accident cover.
For normal laptop once you had completely made an payment, could not added for any warranty cover anymore."

It is not working on the T495 model.
Have anyone tried the code other other models?"

Lenovo Thinkpad,"I digress. Just upgraded my E585 wifi card to Intel AX200NGW & it works pretty well. The default Qualcomm QCA9377 is a bit slow as it's 1x1 only.
As some others have mentioned, Lenovo seems to crease their long time policy of whitelisting Wifi cards in their recent laptops Thinkpad line at least.
Intel AX200NGW is a good option for guys using E485/E585 who are stuck with mediocre Qualcomm or Realtek wifi cards.
The card is available on AliExpress:
For the E495/E595/T495/X395, there is little need to replace the default AC 9260, unless you have a 802.11AX router at home/office."

Just received the invoice from Lenovo for my T495 this morning, ETA should be ard 04th.

Lenovo Thinkpad,yup. your recent buy no sealed sticker?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Where is the rams? Under the batt? Or on board?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"X395 , T495s, T490s, X1 Carbon 7 all Ram onboard."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"still in Incheon. based on other posts, it will go to Shenzen first then to Singapore. How come the X395 orders only took 2 days ah to reach Singapore?

X1 Extreme Gen 1 is back in stock somehow lol. only 1 spec."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"What specs u ordered ?
How come customised still ship out as fast."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I don't think it's considered fast? Ordered during the 9.9 sales.
website states 'ships within 2 weeks' right? and it shipped 3 weeks exact from the date of the order. probably will take another couple of days to reach here. which means 4 weeks total.
the other guys custom spec X395 and T495s shipped way faster. shipped within 2 weeks, and reached 2 days after getting the shipped notice :/

Lenovo Thinkpad,Depend on luck maybe ☹️
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yeah I guess so. maybe I pissed off the customer service

pic from another guy. it shipped using UPS Worldwide Express Saver which should be way faster.

whereas mine shipped using the UPS Worldwide Expedited lol.
remember folks, be patient and don't piss off the customer service"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all, I want to purchase E595 without HDD and only SSD but it seems like the customize option is not offering this. It doesnt even let me select SSD, when they have E595 pre-configured at 256gb SSD already available for sale. Anyone knows why this is the case?
I ask the livechat like 3 times, 2 times they didnt respond and 1 time they said 'checking' and i waited until the chat timeout"
Lenovo Thinkpad,There is a option for the E595 laptop with SSD but you cannot customize.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thats exactly what i said. I want to customize the other options, hence my question. Cause it doesnt make sense to me that they have a pre-config one with SSD but dont allow SSD customize?
Thanks anyway!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Probably limited stock so they list different options.
Else alternate is get with a dummy hard disk than add SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,T495 now 28% off plus shopback 5%
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If get a dummy hardisk, how they able to preload windows os inside the laptop?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,he probably meant get the cheapest HDD and later upgrade them to SSD yourself.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Finally gotten my cashback succesfully, for those who yet to get cashback just monitor closely as there is no reminder when it get rejected."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi bro, When did u made your purchase?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"no OS if dummy HDD, checked before"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"if 3 days after purchase and cashback still not tracked, should submit missing cashback under ""click activity"""
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Sorry my bad, get the HDD than clone the image over to SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I'm waiting for x395 promo...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Got one I found it CS
Lenovo Thinkpad,Not sure if his is just tracked or paid out already. My NDP period purchase is still under tracking status.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Gonna post this for reference for those waiting for their shipments.
I've been looking all around while waiting for mine, and not to much details on the ordering and flow to being delivered.
So, ordered on 9th September, with it stating ""Ships within 2 Weeks"".
Received confirmation straightaway after ordering and they put the total amount on 'Authorisation Hold' on your bank account.
Accessories were shipped within 2-3 days, and Lenovo will charge your account for the accessories amount. If the item is in Singapore, they will ship through Tiong Nam, but if it is out of stock they will ship your accessories from their factory using UPS. Here is the flow of the accessories:
Spoiler!   OrderedSeptember 9, 2019 ShippedSeptember 11, 2019 DeliveredSeptember 16, 2019
Now, back to the laptop.

So the estimate for the shipment itself fluctuates until you get shipping confirmation from UPS. I was given an estimate of 27th Sept being shipped, and estimate delivered on 3th Oct initially, then it got pushed back to 30th Sept being shipped and 4th Oct for estimated delivery.
My card was charged +1 day after the UPS confirmation.
The Laptop warranty also auto-registers when the laptop is shipped.
There's the whole flow to being delivered.
Depending on when you place your order, 'Ships within 2 Weeks' is not accurate. Mine took 4 weeks to reach.
If you are in a hurry to purchase a laptop, I'd suggest to get them from a physical shop like Flagship Store in Funan."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"@Banana10
Congrats to your new toy.
Hope you will feedback after usage 😘😘😘"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"How is the battery life for users of X395? Personally, I feel like not good enough, maybe for me...
Any tips for battery saving?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"How many hours can last for your.
Mine fully changed can last more than 6 hours at least, display set on 70% of brightness , 300nits display."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Rumor that AMD will update the chip with faster CPU and GPU.
Still under 3000 series
Maybe a sign that this series will EOL especially the price but uncertain."
Lenovo Thinkpad,will wait for further cut!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Stay tune
11.11 maybe"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"its not a rumor. most likely renoir apu will take over for mobile.
thats why i decided to skip this thinkpad gen as jumping from zen+ to zen2 architecture will be very significant for ryzen mobile next year"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I can't put a number on it right now. I try another day then I let you know. I'm guessing 5 - 6 hours max, perhaps.
I'm using the 1080p display, should be 300nits as well."

Lenovo Thinkpad,What application is that? I only see this.

new mobile chips using the new iris graphic IGP."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Try to get this
Lenovo Thinkpad,This is mine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i read abt 3550u althought that shld be because of the incoming MS Surface products.
this is probably just a stopgap measure and i dont think Lenovo will issue a minor hardware refresh midway.
the real deal will still be zen 2 mobile next year"

I get mine from TB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yeah the right one, usually the paste those at the bottom.
so they probably forgot? lol"

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all,
Those who missed out on the 09 Sep sale 39% discount for T495.
The T495 is on 40% discount now under ""Double10"""
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I just tried to compare the pricing with same specs as mine, and found out the DOUBLE10 is still more ex than the 9.9 sale.
Even though the DOUBLE10 code has 40% off, it is capped at only $500.
Whereas the 9.9 sale there was no cap.
ordered mine at $1265, and the current sale price for same spec is at $1398.50. That is 9.5% difference. And lets not forget there was a shopback at 9% during the 9.9 sale.
so, you decide if it's a good time to order now."

Before cut, try to get transparency paper or tracing paper.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Normal used such as your input, more or less around 5-6 hours"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone know if it's ok to leave my laptop charging or should I plug out once fully charged. Does it make a difference to the longevity of the battery since the battery is non removable?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Depends on your display brightness, so far 5 -6 hours for me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can set from vantage battery threshold stop at 100%.
Usually I will keep it charged overnight."
Lenovo Thinkpad,you can just leave it plugged.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ok, thanks!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"the battery threshold at Lenovo Vantage can automatically cutoff charging to the battery.
I set mine to charge when below 60% and stop at 80% leaving it plugged it and using it.
Based on what I read, it's not good for batteries to be at 100% all the time. And do not use it till really low %.
Optimum for battery is 40-60% range if you want to extend battery life.
Again, you can do your own readings and choose what to follow.
It's up to you whether you value your battery more or the experience you get from using your laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"oh ok. Thanks for the insight.
The below was quoted from a reddit post, might be helpful."

What would u guys do?
Any way to get some cash out of it?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, the minimum does not matter. Only thing that matters is the max threshold should be about 70% for double lifespan.
Then again take it with a pinch of salt.
If 70% charge not enough to maintain your daily usage then I rather you up the max charge %"

Lenovo Thinkpad,"My friend have 2 units Thinkbook 13s, receive early November 😏😏

Lenovo Thinkpad,T495 and T495s have different specs. T495s is lighter at about 1.3kg and t495 at 1.5. Battery is also bigger for T495s.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi delete your pm quota
Thanks"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I heard that T495s battery last longer than the T495.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Want to pull the trigger on T495s Ryzen 7, but the lack of reviews kinda hesitate me.
Any T495s users here got any experience/concern on this machine, especially on the fan noise/heat I read on one of the web review.
Thanks!"

Compare with T495 and X395,
T495s has the best battery life. Slightly better than x395.
Not sure if it's the 3700 chip vs 3300 chip. Read that 3700 chip is not very efficient? But I am a noob. Maybe someone can advise."
Lenovo Thinkpad,JUST realised that x395 review is up!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My T490

And X395 both has wifi on."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"T495s can probably run for 7 hours with WiFi and word and songs. One of the user posted.
How about x395s? Can share the time?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"dun really like their reviews of x395 lol
they took ryzen 3 pro 3300u to compare with i5s and i7s
how to compare apples to oranges
shud have gotten the ryzen 5 pro 3500u vs i5

it depends on what u doing with it and find one screen size that suits u."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"oh ur x395 is a spare laptop??
x1 carbon like out of stock but i'm also interested in the ultra slim/portable category of lenovo because weight is truly an issue for me
btw, why u upgrade to IR cam ar?"

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Any idea when is the earliest the AMD APU zen 2 will come out for laptop? I think they gonna announce at CES 2020??
When they announce in jan 2020, means lenovo have stock to sell already or must wait further? If yes, must wait how long based on past history?
I'm not sure about AMD product cycle...reason being is if I dont see any good deals, I don't mind waiting to upgrade to Zen 2
The 1k SGD for maxed out T495 deal is really too good...dunno if it will come this 11
tl dr t495s > x395 > t495?
tbh t495s have bigger screen and is same weight as x395...so why choose x395 ar?
1 For x395, if want to plug in the Ethernet LAN wire into laptop, need doggle?
2 Does T495 or t495s come with native ethernet port?
When play games, I always use wired; thats why asking about this ethernet port
3 When closer to 11.11, lenovo will come out with more surprise deal issit?
4 If choose multi touch, will it affect the display quality due to 300 nits only?? saw sth like multi touch, less gamut or true color what is gamut lol
I saw previous replies that said to upgrade to 400 nits to give flexibility...is the upgrade worth it?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If your budget allows you to get a much brighter screen...
Go for 400 nits or even 500 nits
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"New gen will not launch that fast especially the Zen 2.
Earliest will be Mid 2020.
For now you can consider Thinkpad based on Ryzen.
But if you are gaming like playing COD Modern Warefare
than suggest go for gaming laptop instead.
Online gaming best is to use native LAN port but not dongle
or WIFI for the X395.
USB LAN Doggle uses USB interface isn't that fast like native
LAN port due to USB speed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wah mid 2020? Then I guess buy now
I only play dota 2 with friends, don't play other games
Yes, I think native LAN port is sibei important. I cannot stand lag even if wifi 5ghz.
Any idea which ThinkPad lineup or series that have built in native port? Does that mean all X series don't have native LAN port?
As I'm not hardcore gamer, and weight quite important, I don't think worth it to upgrade to gaming laptop unless really no choice"

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Zen+ you don't like? Don't tell me you fear overheat and slow?
AMD have come a long way since Thunderbird which have
such issue.
Anyway if you wish to buy Intel, no one is stopping you other
than your wallet.
When you see Thinkpad based on Intel, it is usually cost more than
the price of AMD based laptop.
If for work, Intel i5 with Intel UHD will do. Gaming wise best go
for Intel based gaming laptop.
Thinkpad with option for discrete graphics, certain models according
to review site it is very warm under load.
Options like discrete Radeon graphics and etc. can get warm under load.
Gaming laptop will have better cooling especially with twin fans.
For me AMD based Thinkpad still worth it unless perception of AMD
is what bother you.
AMD Ryzen 5 3500U VS Intel i5, CPU is more or less on par but
the iGPU Vega graphics trash Intel UHD easily."

Edit:have reconfirmed with another CSO. Only for THINK series, the warranty will be extended to Singapore. So we no need to go back Malaysia for servicing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,if 2nd or 3rd yr have issues...gg
Lenovo Thinkpad,Have to go back to msia during weekdays. Righy now Malaysia Lenovo is offering 3y premium support for just RM1. I think is a good buy and pray it does not give you any problem after the first yr.
Lenovo Thinkpad,60% gadgets and laptops usually dies or become problematic just after warranty ends lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Usually new laptop got issue is when you received.
After that no issue is consider no issue at all.
Common problem is display death pixels, keyboard no function or tracked else.
Very seldom hear about motherboard issue or battery failure within warranty"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Some cso may give u free mouse or power bank
Lenovo Thinkpad,I dun hv a malaysian address then how to buy from Lenovo Malaysia and ship to SG? Plus the shipping still cheaper?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just to check when I configure the T495s, it says that ""WWAN Selection: WWAN and Integrated Mobile Broadband: WWAN No Card with Antenna"". What does that mean? Comes with built in LTE slot to put sim card?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Such as X1 extreme midnight sale at 1.6k only, I dun think u got enough time to wait"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Put in your nano SIM card can work already
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No forwarder in Malaysia actually, for those traveling daily to SG , maybe they can help.
But no guarantee is sealed in box.
Cause the SG custom will tax for 7%, if this is fully sealed in box.
For example like thinkpad have come with plastic sealed on the laptop itself should not be an issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,dun have leh
Lenovo Thinkpad,"There's 2 options:
Integrated Mobile Broadband
1 Fibocom L850-GL 4G LTE CAT9
2 WWAN No Card with Antenna
Both cost $0; which huan better?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Go stay in a reputable hotel in Malaysia and ask them to keep the parcel for you. Still cheaper if go on weekdays.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"WWAN and Integrated Mobile Broadband - SIM Card slot
Any country SIM can be used.
WWAN No Card with Antenna - No SIM Card Slot since WWAN Card
is not installed but antenna is inside meaning can add on later.
WWAN Card is only useful for those who intend to use mobile data
on the go.
If the cost is worth it than go for it, else use a dongle or huawei mifi
but you have to carry it around.
If lost during overseas or travel than gg, WWAN card would be better
no need to carry it around and the SIM card is always inside the laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I see, so if both $0, choose the one with card.
Sad thing about T495s is that can only configure up to 24 GB ram?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,T495s and X395 maximum up to 16GB ram only
Lenovo Thinkpad,"So if u choose WWAN no card with antenna, cannot put sim card in the laptop to use? If can why still need the WWAN card?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all, have reconfirmed with another CSO. Only for THINK series, the warranty period, no matter is 1 or 3y, will be extended to cover Singapore too."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Looks like coverage
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Errr.. The SIM card slot is added when the WWAN card is installed.
Both are required to work as the WWAN card is the modem card in order for the SIM card to communicate and make connection.
It does not work like HP SIM card slot if that is what you are asking."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thinkpad series is international warranty. Even if extend to 3 years, just that it will become carry in for out of home country."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone felt that it's a pain to have the fn key on the extreme left and ctrl on its right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Isn't ctrl on left and right?
For which model?
PS I don't have lenovo laptop but if no ctrl key on left, then I won't buy one ever"
Lenovo Thinkpad,What I meant was fn key is on the extreme left of the keyboard and the ctrl key is on the right of the fn key. This setup is different from the usual keyword configuration where ctrl is on the right and fn is on the left
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can change in bios
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ooh.. Thanks! Found the steps in Google.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For those using x395, should I go for multi-touch display? It will be a cool function but will it have any impact on the lifespan of the screen?
The price different between multi-touch and normal IPS is around 40sgd if buy from Malaysia site."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"How you buy?
Current their website have buggy, when check out appear the error message.
Can’t even made the payment."
Lenovo Thinkpad,SG or MY site? Didn't notice any bugs yet. U going to buy another one? 😄
Lenovo Thinkpad,"can i check multi touch means touchscreen?
meaning can use stylus and write stuff and won't have big issue?
or is it only for fingers?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,i'm just waiting for Black Friday/Cyber Monday. Possibly getting the T495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Now my Lenovo SG save to cart direct link to maintenance page lol.
Lenovo malaysia no matter use what’s cards, still have an issue, payment couldn’t get through, after charge RM1 in your CC.
Give up my order for Lenovo Urban Targus backpack in blue color that is nice, SG website do not selling that backpack."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"based on historical trend, black friday discount better than 11.11 or sama sama?"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Have you bought?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wow... Look like there's no delay compared to 9.9.. Ordered on 7th, expected delivery is today."
Lenovo Thinkpad,How many units you bought?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Why cannot use type c dongle instead of traditional full rj45 port?
Most ultraportable laptop no longer comes with Rj45 port, except those thicken chassis still remain as full rj45 socktet for office used."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"@those who bought from Malaysia, did u get the free power bank from CS for adding their REPID?
Was the power bank listed in the order and email sent to you? Rn, I can't see the power bank in my order. Don't know if I should chase them or not
@obi:personal preference...for me, quite important. For others, WiFi will do"

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just wondering for those who got X395 on Ryzen Pro 5 3500U, how much did they score on PCMark 11? I think Lenovo throttles T495s to reduce TDP cos of heat... Manage to get ard 3000+ only."

I thought accessories should be fast and simple since I saw some posts here say they got it after 2 days
But no issue rah. Weird as first time buy and thought will receive quick like others"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Spent time to tune and eventually, decided to reset the laptop to stock image and download the AMD chipset drive to install. Finally, manage to get all the core to boost and can see that it is boost to the limit of 25w and finally getting ard 3700 for PCMark 10. It seems that the Lenovo stock driver isn't optimise for the AMD chip and need to download the AMD driver to install manually..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Is there a checklist or guide of things to do when receive ThinkPad for new users?
For example,
Update Bios, drivers
Install Lenovo vintage?
Windows update
Any bloatware to remove or settings to turn off always on USB?
Anything else?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Dunno. Maybe some experts can do that? I did install the latest AMD kit chipset drivers etc from Lenovo but it seems to be buggy which kills off performance. I hardly see my core 0 and 1 to move above 1.5Ghz during load with min cpu state at 90-100%. I have no idea it was stuck and that resulted only 3000 pts for PCMark 10. The laptop felt so slow like an 5 yrs old laptop.
After several tries and errors, I decided to download the latest AMD chipset drivers from AMD this time instead of Lenovo. Using AMD uProf, I can see that all my cores are active and can hit 3.5Ghz or close to 3.7Ghz and occassionally hitting 25-28W and stable around 20-22W during load. My PCMark 10 result jumps to 3700 pts. It does not really matter which power profile I use Lenovo Intelligent or AMD Ryzen Balanced.
The latest AMD chipset drivers from Lenovo for T495s is buggy... don't use it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just finish setting up my x395 ytd. Spent quite some time to configure nicely. I just used Lenovo vantage to update everything, including bios, Radeon graphic, windows updates, etc. I encountered the radeon setting and version not compatible. So need to go into registry to make some changes."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyone has issues with your T495s reading microSD card?
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I did put in the card then boot up but didn't detect the card. Remove and reinsert then able to detect. Maybe the first time I didn't insert properly?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Same cos windows will auto update the driver and end up it is not tally.
I installed the latest adrenaline raedon driver from AMD which is newer n better.
Did a benchmark run? See if it matches or close to those benchmark results... I did that and realise the Lenovo AMD driver isn't working well and my core 0 and 1 got stuck at 1.5ghz even at load. Manage to resolve it by installing the latest AMD chipset drivers."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hmm the story is dont update from vantage or windows update?
direct download from AMD website?
what's the correct sequence to update?
AMD->vantage->windows update?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Will windows or vantage update overwrite it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Overwrite which one? The AMD driver from AMD website is the newer version so windows n vantage will not overwrite it unless it has a higher version.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I will try again

Lenovo Thinkpad,"hi, this is my graphic driver version for my x395: 26.20.11028.6003
Is this the latest one?
Tried using bluestacks, unfortunately the game is too laggy. Not sure whether it's becos of the graphic.
Found some more drivers over here, not sure is this compatible with my laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya this is the latest AMD graphics drivers for Ryzen Radeon Vega.
U might want to download and install the AMD chipset driver too. https://www.amd.com/en/support/chipsets/socket-fp5-mobile/amd-ryzen-and-athlon-mobile-chipset"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks alot!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wanted to give the Lenovo AMD kit a chance, I went to read up the Lenovo AMD kit and see what are the driver version... Uninstall the latest AMD driver and install back the Lenovo drivers. After I verify the driver version to ensure it was installed properly. Got to uninstall the graphics card and install Lenovo ones cos if not Windows will install back its own Vegra version.
Run the pcmark10 again, and this time the results is within expectation ard 3650+. The fastest I got with using AMD driver from AMD website and I got around 3740+. Latest AMD still faster. I suspect when I reinstall the windows, the drivers are not loaded properly probably so of the drivers are installed automatically by windows with the wrong version that resulted in only 3000+ pcmark10 score."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hmm so if install latest AMD, windows will uninstall and install its version?
For users who receive new laptop, first step is
1 download lenovo vantage and install lenovo drivers
2 windows update
3 install latest amd drivers?
Thanks for sharing this...my laptop arriving soon
edit: this pcmark 10 need to pay to use? can't find free version..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"first step is
enjoy your new laptop
why need to do so many things lol
just let it run automatically lah"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not sure cos maybe I have a few version of drivers...
My set comes with Vantage installed. Anyway, just go and check if you are running the latest Lenovo drivers such as AMD Kit will do. Look at the readme from the Lenovo website to see the version and compared to your installed driver.
For the AMD drivers from the AMD site, u can ignore unless u wanna try the difference.
Pcmark10 needs to install steam to download and launch. There is a free demo version which is good enough."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"haha, need to setup and configure for best experience mah
hmm okay, the problem with installing the latest AMD drivers from AMD is that windows will uninstall and install its own version?
i see, then i will just follow ur advice and install lenovo drivers then win update"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Usually I will teardown to replace from 128/256gb of SSD instead of 1TB storage.
Follow by fresh windows installation and install all my daily use software will do.
Last step enjoy it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ya agreed. I went to tweak cos I feel that it was a bit slow initial even normal usage and realized the drivers wasn't installed correctly and slowness can be confirmed and now with the correct drivers installed it is much better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Is this possible if I, first do a bootable thumb drive?
And then swap the SSD for higher cap?
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya need download windows installation disk for USB drive.
Follow by replace ssd done and tag on F12 when startup , select boot from USB drive.
Make sure go for customise mode to format your ssd or do partion at same time before fresh windows installation.
Link below"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya cause Lenovo ssd upgrade very expensive , usually I will buy ssd for my own.
Before customised try to select the minimum storage as you can."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"wah, got so many bloatware to slow new laptop down, even if top spec?
so many ppl reinstall windows when they get new laptop?
but since so many old bird lenovo buyer do it, i will play for a few days then try fresh install when got time before i transfer all my old stuff over to new ssd"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"So if you upgrade SSD on your own, u usually choose the traditonal HDD and then do u separately buy a SATA ssd or NVME m.2? Assuming T495."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"But if you upgrade yourself it will void warranty, right?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lenovo allow u upgrade like ram, wifi card or Ssd, but make sure do not touch the rest.
If they won’t allow you upgrade mean the screw have warranty sealed sticker,
If anythng wanna claim , the original ssd try to keep with original software.
Anything went wrong just put back for warranty. once got an issue u need to restall your windows as well, otherwise ur data all expose for someone."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wah must give them the drive? Can just take out the ssd before passing to them? Should have ticked the keep your drive during purchase issit?
Don't wan become Edison Chen wor"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hahah , if u remove they claim that void your warranty how?
Make sure check with any SA.
If they come onsite and copy out all your data how?
Later you be another Stomp 🌟 person."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Good to know this... Thanks. going to buy E595 soon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyone knows what was the 11.11 discount % for E595?
Can assume same or better discount for black friday?"

Lenovo Thinkpad,How about Lenovo ThinkBook 15? Is this a worth it? i7 10 Gen is about 1.6K. How does Think Book compare with Thinkpad?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/lenovo-thinkbook-13s-vs-lenovo-thinkpd-x390/
Lenovo’s iconic ThinkPad has been its go-to laptop line for business users for years. But the company decided the ThinkPad might be too much for small business people who might want something that’s not quite so business-like. Therefore, it created the ThinkBook line, which melds consumer and business features for someone who’s looking for a mix of both.
If you are really not sure which one to get....
Then I strongly suggest you to head down to a physical LENOVO authorized dealer which offers a wide range of Lenovo laptop for you to try them out physically.
To me, typing experience is one of my top priorities.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"i dun think the keyboard , typing experience will be the same as thinkpad."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"ThinkPad more on carbon , plastic and poly material, design for drop and durable chassis.
Downside is bulky and dirty with fingerprints, also thin bezel.
IdeaPad metal body, better feel , bezel less, anti fingerprints and easy to maintain.
The good thing is less bored."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I bought E595 yesterday.. the customer rep said if i install a RAM myself, it will void warranty. Not sure if he really knows whether RAM slot is sealed or not.
Anyone bought this already configurable model, can confirm whether RAM slot is sealed?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,CSO bullsh***ing you. Warranty only void if you damage parts due to actions like using a crowbar to remove the RAM.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"oh is it?
because of CSO i ordered 8 GB just to be safe in case the slot is sealed.. could easily buy 16 GB on amazon for that same price."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Why not

Lenovo Thinkpad,"I have a similar case as well for a few years back for a Lenovo Laptop. I brought a ThinkPad and the reseller offer upgrade of SSD. One year later, the SSD got a problem. I called the Customer Support Technician to come to the office. The Technician saw that SSD is third party. He/She said can void the warranty. So we explain the story to the Technician with the receipt and the offer taken in picture Saved by the account dept. He/She said it company policies but we taken it well after some explainations. They reserve the right to void the warranty.
I think they do not want to promise anyone that any RAM can slot in. Better to be safe than sorry. I got the E495 in July but I yet to open it yet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"That's pretty unlucky... SSD for issue after just one year
But lucky you have all the evidence saved. Otherwise really suck thumb

Any suggestion? Can i just get something that says DDR4 2400 mhz SoDIMM and expect it to work on E595...?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes the invoice was kept, it only reflected SSD upgrade with no brand indicated. So the tech guy cannot determine the upgrade is legitimate. So yeap. The aftermath was the tech guy ask me to go directly to the SSD maker and make a complaint and reinstall the OS on my own."

Not available for pre-model have to check with SA, usually try to customised by your own to be save place."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thank you sir! Was confused when I read some post that if select dummy drive for 1st hard drive and SSD as second hard drive then there will be no OS. Haha.
Both slots are 2.5inch sata slots right? Say if I select only SSD and would want to install another SSD on my own... Am I able to do that?"

I want the data on it.
I will buy a new laptop set with 128 gig ssd pre installed
I want to insert this old 2.5 sata into the the new computer
Will I void the warranty on the new computer?
If I insert ram from my old laptop into the new one, will it void the warranty too ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Generally if you upgrade/migrate parts from another laptop.
Warranty won't be void.
However:
- RAM must be of same spec and supported by the laptop.
- HDD wise you can migrate over but take the data you have
to either retrieve it first."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I have some technical questions. I noticed some people prefer to do a clean install of Windows 10 to remove bloatware and vendor-installed programs when they get their brand new laptop. I am thinking through about the process.
After you clean install, how do you handle the licensing portion or the activation portion?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If yours is a Skylake CPU ie 6th gen or newer, Windows should automatically activate  on its own. If you want to play it safe, get the existing product key using tools such as Showkeyplus or Produkey before installing Windows."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks Ark. I download Showkeyplus and was able to obtain by installed key.
For non-Intel like Lenovo Ryzen CPU in this case, will they automatically activate also?"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Don’t forget if the laptop itself without thunderbolt port there’s no function at all.
Lenovo Thinkpad,my friend also say most need thunderbolt... otherwise we will need to DIY using PCI-E?!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"PCIe card for desktop only.
But laptop don’t have any option to upgrade or add on media card."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not entirely impossible but I haven't seen anyone try. Our laptops typically have a mini PCIe slot for WWAN card. Some ppl will use it to install a PCIe NVME 2242 SSD, but I haven't seen anyone daring enough to try to extend this port for eGPU purposes.   To do so, you'll probably have to modify the laptop chassis significantly to allow for the additional cabling"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can find here from YouTube
Lenovo Thinkpad,"eGPU from Razer Core X , just plug in for any thunderbolt 3 port will work."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi, @bumdssa
Warranty wise, you may remove in future if anything go wrong, otherwise your data will be expose to someone.
Once you had remove your SSD 2.5 sata they won't void your warranty.

2. First Hard Drive --> I have selected 500GB
3. Second Hard Drive --> Which one will be better ?
Also, the OS will be installed on which hard drive if I choose both 1st and 2nd hard drive.

3. SSD can left this empty.
IF you have extra nvme 256gb , can use as main drive to booting up windows to save your awaiting time.
I mean do upgrade in future."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Seeking some help here.
Previously, I mentioned in this thread that I experience BSOD from time to time. It has gotten more frequent, so I contacted Lenovo, and they asked me to do testings, which all passed, and troubleshoot, which did not resolve the issue. The final step they told me is to reset my windows. As I was backing up whatever I need, I experienced BSOD 5 times in an hour. The resetting of windows failed too, so I had to go down to the service centre to borrow a copy of the windows to reinstall. Feeling that there is something wrong, I sent in my laptop and gotten it back yesterday, with the SSD replaced. Zzz. Dunno how the tests I was supposed to run didnt picked that up.
Anyway, thats not I am seeking help here for. My Seagate external hard-disk cannot be seen from Windows Explorer. Even the Seagate Toolkit cannot open the drive. But under device manager, the external hard-disk is there and it is supposed to be working properly. I tried updating drivers, but it says it already has the latest drivers.
I tried plugging that external hard-disk to my MacBook to see if the hard disk Ian really dead, but it can be detected and I managed to extract everything out into my MacBook.
Anyone knows whats wrong with the windows on the T585?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wonder check with you, do you formatted and do fresh windows installation?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"In my side, I chose the reset option as I dont have a physical copy of the windows. Failed.
After the service centre replaced my SSD, not sure what they did. I would assume its a fresh install."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"As per your specs , this is come with both drives?
Hdd for main and secondary was the ssd?
Actually service Center can be exchange from Ssd for main drive and HDD for backup drive D.
Anyway hopefully it’s working fine"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Only 1 drive. SSD for main. No secondary drive. I use external hard-drive for backup.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"usually after u place order, it takes 2-3 weeks to ship out?
When they ship out, that's when they charge to the credit card right?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo charge u after receive the UPS tracking number.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"ok can. I managed to get CSO to waive off the 3 years warranty $72.50. I heard some bros here did the same but they didn't waive it off. Hopefully mine waived off.
The 5% shopback is also a significant saving."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"which model did you buy?
you asked for waiver after ordering?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wanted to get T495 but no discount so i decided to get E495. i ask before ordering.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Using E485, anyone encountered random beep on their speakers. No sequence , beep at the max volume of the speakers.
Updated audio, video and lan drivers.
TIA."
Lenovo Thinkpad,any one know is there any Ryzen laptop with thunderbolt port?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thunderbolt is Intel with Apple project.
I don’t think AMD wanna pay license to Intel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Intel is licensing TB3 royalty free for inclusion into USB4. We'll see laptops with AMD chips and TB3-enabled USB4 ports coming in 2020/21.
Source:"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"TB3 is good to help those needed egpu for gaming.
But make sure the laptop can able to upgrade from minimum Ram 8gb to 32gb Ram at least.
Otherwise hang on half way or can’t shut down after exit from eGPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Fyi.  My T495 Ethernet port seems looser than most other Ethernet ports on other devices. Doesn't seem to affect the contact with Ethernet cable but still, I am not too happy about it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Okay thanks for sharing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,can't wait to see the new amd models!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyone have any recommendations for a GaN charger? Something cheap and reliable, preferably with SG plug"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi, can anybody direct me to the latest AMD driver software version and suitable AMD catalyst centre for x395?
My Radeon Software Version is: 19.10.28.08, driver version is: 26.20.11028.8001
Thanks in advance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Usually graphic driver for laptop best to use manufacturer than AMD.
On Lenovo support site, the driver you are using is the latest for X395
by Lenovo.
Unless you are having issues than update to drivers from AMD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thank you. How about AMD catalyst? Strangely the laptop does not come with pre-installed catalyst. My desktop does thou. Is x395 compatible with this program?
My laptop is lagging when running Android emulator, so I'm find ways to enhance the performance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Probably the driver is automatic updated by Windows 10 that is why the catalyst control centre isn't installed.
You can try:
- Download the driver from Lenovo website
- Disconnect the laptop from Internet.
*This is to prevent Windows 10 for installing missing drivers
- Download and run AMD Uninstall Ultity from AMD website
- Install the Driver from Lenovo
- Install the additional Radeon Application profile
Hope this helps."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks a lot!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"looking to get the E495 for purely work excel etc, currently using a mac.
Currently there's not much additional discount apart from the regular on-going ""sale"".
Is it an okay price, ThinkPad E495 - 20NE001FSG @ SGD$767?
Will there be any upcoming promotions / and if so, will it differ much?
Cheers"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I was waiting since Oct. 11.11, 12.12, black friday, christmas. No promo. Lowest is 21% ish. So i suggest you probably wait for at most CNY promo. Then if cannot get good deals, you just purchase it after CNY."
Lenovo Thinkpad,how much was the price after the 21%?

Lenovo Thinkpad,yup $1 for 3 years warranty almost like waive off.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Trying to factory reset a T495 but I can't find any Lenovo recovery program.
Is there such a program installed in the first place, or I simply use the Reset function in Windows 10? If it the latter method, will it install the Vantage after reset or require re-download?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Unless you are savvy enough, you can try clean install.
Preferably load the drivers from Lenovo after the install."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks.
Probably I will just do a reset with Windows 10 and download the Vantage and Radeon applications separately from Lenovo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i followed this link -
- to create a USB recovery disk for my T480"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just want to share my lenovo svc support experience for those interested.
My E585 was overheating under load and sometimes BSOD, so i used online chat to contact support. I was 1st in queue and discussed with the rep, showing her screenshot of 70C temp alongside only 20% cpu usage. She said engineer will be sent and I received sms confirmation about an hour later. Appointment date was next day.
Engineer called before arriving. He was very friendly and gave frank advice. He said AMD will run hotter than intel, so may want to consider laptop fan pad if I'll be using laptop for 8+ hours a day. After warranty, I can also consider replacing the thermal grease on my own. He checked then replaced the heatsink fan assembly easy, 4 screws and a plug, and said to call him directly if problem returns.
The entire flawless support process took less than 24 hours. I'm so glad I got their on-site 3-yr support.
Background of my overheating problem:
My 1 yr old e585 was reaching 85C while just performing backup or installing large software, sometimes resulting in BSOD. disks temp were just 44C, 54C A previous large windows update BSOD midway and corrupted my windows. This never happened before.
Took me a while to come to conclusion it was heat related. I ran lenovo's windows diagnostics software but fan test passed. Fortunately I found the problem after I monitored using HWMonitor. the engineer mentioned lenovo has a temperature software for download too
After the replacement, I ran backup and max temp immediately reduced to 75C. The old fan looked very clean and perfect, so it should be that the thermal grease lost effectiveness over time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,can share what is the lenovo temperature sw ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,thanks for sharing. will monitor the heat for these ryzen chip.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Tried looking couldn't find it. He may be referring to Lenovo Diagnostics Windows, under Tools tab there is a Fan Device showing current cpu temp and fan speed.
Btw also want to mention I like their diag software. Very comprehensive can check mobo, pcie, lid sensor, wifi, etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"no prob. he also mentioned overheating can damage mobo so need to be wary indeed. ryzen does outperform intel chips though, so some consolation there i guess."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I have used several gen of AMD laptop, temp have not reach that high before.
AMD Turion, Phenom II and A series, highest I recall was about 70.
Average was about 50 or so.
Maybe you have to do maintenance like:
- Update BIOS If you haven't
- Fresh install OS/Reset OS
Especially if your OS was updated from 1809 to 1903.
Best to do a fresh install.
- Try installing the graphic driver from Lenovo than AMD.

Lenovo version maybe older but the chip will run at it's optimal
setting like clock speed.
- Update AMD Chipset Driver"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for the link.
I wasnt able to select most of my USB disk as recovery during the process. Not sure the reason despite all my USB drives satisfy the requirements. Windows 10 is able to detect all of them.
Manage to create the recovery when I tried the last one."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You can try use Command prompt diskpart to partition the
USB disk suitable to create recovery media."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes my first instinct was check the software, so updated via vantage and windows updates. But didnt solve anything. I'm also using lenovo's graphics driver."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"what's the size of your drives?
I vaguely remember i was only successful after i pop in a 16GB/32GB stick, not sure which one i popped in.
Was concurrently doing another recovery drive for my HP Envy"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I'm using 32GB drive but it fails.
Resort to using a MicroSD card inserted into the USB card reader and the creation cam proceed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Does your thumb drive have other files?
Usually I use a freshly formatted flash drive
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think it's more likely to be poor thermal paste application from the factory or sub-optimal heatsink contact. That said, my E585 ranges from 42C to 88C during normal usage at room temp of about 29C.
It's possible that the newer BIOS have changes to the CPU throttling behaviour, cos I don't remember seeing temperatures of more than 82C a few BIOS versions back.
I have ran Intel i7 8650u on Thinkpad x280 beyond 90C under full load there is a limit to how well a slim chassis can cool.
The notebook design & thermal/power limits set by the OEM in the bios make the biggest difference.
It's not true that AMD mobile CPUs run hotter than equivalent Intel CPUs, at least for CPUs fabbed under 12nm/14nm process & set to run at similar power limits eg: 25W.
Just use CPU Coretemp."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all,
I am using a T495. My laptop has been lagging very badly  eg open chrome, open jpg file it spins for quite a while, even scrolling down a web page it lags.
I even have problem shutting down.
Could it be due to the windows upgrade to V1909 2?thnks"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Do a clean install if you know how to.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It was formatted several times right before I start the process of creating the recovery.
Yesterday, I bought another thumbdrive, same brand USB 3 and capacity, and it works out of the box.
Just curious about the reason it fails to work on the older thumbdrive despite Windows 10 detects and read/write flawlessly with it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"glad to hear that it's working for you now.
Mind sharing which brand/model thumbdrive giving you the issue?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Now bad time to buy customized laptop. Likely to take over 1 month rather than 2 weeks as shown on website from payment to shipping.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Sandisk Extreme USB3 32GB has the issue. But I dont really think it is faulty since Windows 10 is able to detect and I can continue to read/write files to it during my testing. Probably it is due to disk partition as someone has pointed out.
Bought 2 Sandisk Ultra 32GB with no issue out of the box."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Read someone purchase got delayed previously.
Bought mine before the CNY and fortunately, I received it 2 weeks later. If not for the CNY holidays, I aight receive it earlier."

Thus I usually use Ultra to do it than
Extreme pro."

Lenovo Thinkpad,My order back in June 2019 was picked up in Shanghai. They have many factory in China.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Dear Customer,
Due to the recent coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese Government has imposed regulations restricting the movement of personnel across many regions in China. This has impacted our factory operations and delivery schedule. Our factories will be partially operational during the middle of February before returning to normal operations by end of February. Therefore, your orders may be delayed for an additional 2-3 weeks. We are in constant communication with our factories on delivery schedule.
If you would like to know more about ready-to-ship options that are available in our warehouse, please contact our sales and online chat team at 800-601-1481 option #1.
Should you have further questions, please feel free to reach out to us. We are sorry for any inconvenience this delay may have caused.
Thank you for your support.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Hi selling my rarely use mint condition x395 max specs
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo factory will start full production only from 24 Feb.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Whether they can start successfully or not... That is another question.
What I heard is that China factories need to submit a request to resume work to the local Province authority.
The province authority will need to check if the factory is able to reduce n prevent local transmission of coronavirus to the lowest possibility.
Check whether have mask
Check this, check that.
If don't have... Cannot resume work

Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am using the E485 for about a year now and so far the temps are within expectation. Due to the size of the heatsink, it is normal for the temps to hit north of 80 degs. I've even changed the thermal compound to Thermal Grizzly, and at load, it will still hit the low 80 degs. While the E585 has a bigger chassis, the cooler and heatsink unfortunately is still small and the bottleneck. I can't confirm what is the temp threshold before it throttles the CPU frequency, but I believe it should be something like 82 to 85 degs.
Glad they resolved your issue."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Can I check if T495 WiFi card can upgrade to Intel AX?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This is just.....
I have raised cancellation request. Due to the various bad feedback on the lenovo forums about order cancellation, I have done one step further by cancelling the credit card I used for the laptop order to prevent it from being charged."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am not sure if cancelling your card will help. Normally once you placed an order, the seller will send a request to your card company to ""lock in"" the amount. The idea is really to prevent people from cancelling their card when they want to collect payment. You can determine if this is the case by checking your card limit vs the actual amount you spent the difference is likely the ""locked in"" amount. While the card is cancelled, if Lenovo decides to take payment, the amount will still be charged to you."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Do you need it to be mobile, i.e. ability to move around with it? If not, I rather you just go straight for a micro ITX rig.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just to check. Thinking of getting the x395. Any idea,
1. Besides lenovo sg online anywhere else can i go down to buy?
2. If only able to purchase from online, how long is the waiting time. Anyone bought from online lenovo store b4?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,last year I bought an IdeaPad for my in-laws and it took almost two weeks IIRC. Now due to COVID might be longer unless you buy ready to ship models?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"there is a flagship shop at Funan. But if you want to customize your laptop, then it is better to order it directly from lenovo singapore website."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Choose NVME. They will install OS on the SSD if it is present. Also, I would recommend going for the Ryzen 5 3500U. The extra cores are well worth the upgrade considering that there is no way you can upgrade later. But really depends on what you will use the computer for."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I feel the parts are available, just whether the factories have started work in China. I believe so, though not at 100% capacity. So I agree there may be a delay, but should not be that bad. Otherwise there is no reason for them to start a big sale on 3:3 which they can barely fulfill."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I see otherwise.
They will launch the sale due to no computer show in March 2020. Whether they can fulfill is up to China side. If can not fulfill, blame it on China. At least I told my boss I did my part while 20-30% of the sales may be dropped by customers, I still have that 70% for my bonus."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for the feedback
Working indoors, so screen should not be an issues.
No heavy macros or whatsoever"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lenovo so called ""NVME"" SSD are actually M2 SATA I think. I got very slow read write speed, not that of NVME. Changed to real ADATA NVME and got triple speed of the lenovo hynix SSD.
Lenovo SSD - 500MB read 200MB write
ADATA SSD - 1800MB read 900MB write.
Hynix is made in korea so...... can't be poor NAND memory right?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Maybe MX230?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Closest will likely be MX130. But do note that integrated graphics like the Vega 8 here is going to be slower since it shares resources with the CPU. The 15W TDP is going to be a dampener to performance as well when both the CPU and GPU are under load.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Are you comparing with similar size SSD? The last time I took out the NVME SSD from my E485, it was from Toshiba and it doesn't come with any DDR cache onboard. Without onboard RAM on the SSD, it will adversely impact performance. It was running faster than the SATA3 specs, so will have to be an NVME drive at least for my case.
Actually don't have to speculate if its NVME or not. Some apps will tell you what SSD is being used when you run them, i.e. Speccy, and even the more conventional HWMonitor should give you an idea/ model number."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My take is to up the RAM size to a single 8GB, and you can get another 8GB from Sim Lim. While you can run 4GB + 16GB in dual channel, I am not sure if it is ideal since 1 channel has 4x more ram than the other.
In addition, you should upgrade the 45W charger to a 65W version. I recall the upgrade was 2 bucks or less. While 45W is sufficient in most cases, it is good to have some extra legroom for faster charging, and it should be less taxing on the power brick when the laptop is under load."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Well, lets say I regretted upgrading from the default 128gb to 256gb from Lenovo. Yes it is in comparsion with same size 256GB SSD from Adata SX8200 Pro which I changed to this year I got the laptop last year in June."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I think it is more cost effective to get the default 4gb and upgrade to a kit. Amazon and Newegg sell cheaper. I maxed out to 32gb at only S$119 in Jan 2020 from newegg global.
Lenovo Thinkpad,If thats the case the I think just getting the base model then doing the ram upgrades and ssd upgrades diy is more cost efficient
Lenovo Thinkpad,Near MX130.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This is true. When I got my E485, the funny thing was upgrading to 8GB from the default 4GB did not cost anything. So I went for the 8GB and bought another 8GB stick from Amazon."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think it will be good if you do some comparison first. RAM wise, I believe it will be more cost efficient. For SSD wise, I am not 100% sure because you need to have an SSD in the first place, and the upgrade cost to get a 256 or 512GB is not that significant."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"my own t495s went with 512gb ssd and 16gm ram.
only thing I regretted was not adding the WWAN
anyone knows what is the maximum capacity for the sd card slot?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,WWAN card cost only $30 at aliexpress. But have to check if the antenna is installed or not. Max SSD supported might be 2TB. I'm using 2TB on my E495 with no problem
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I hope you are not planning to use the SD card slot as an alternative storage for your laptop though. I rather you install a 2TB SATA SSD than to spend a fortune getting an SD card. It is not cost effective and significantly slower than a proper SSD.
As to your question, I doubt there is a limit currently. The biggest micro SD storage size is 1TB currently, but that will cost as much as a 2TB SSD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"sigh...... not only that.... i need the Lenovo Thinkpad Sim card + SD card hybrid slot as well
2TB... cool!
i am thinking to increase both ssd & microSD in the near future when price drop
the SD card.... I just using as a backup"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My advise is not to spend a fortune on a SD card. It is not worth it at all. Just a 512GB cost you as much as a 512GB NVME drive, and it is painfully slow and not a reliable storage. If you need that much storage, invest in a NAS or use a Cloud account."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"waiting for the new AMD chips..
can't wait to see what they can do."
Lenovo Thinkpad,think you buy USB3 thumb drives or SSD better for backups
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thumb drives are not much better than SD cards in my opinion. While they can be faster than SD cards, but they just as much as a high capacity SD card."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Likewise. In fact I am more excited about the desktop APU since it will make a good low power computer with good graphics.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for responding, bro. I came across this comment by a reviewer:
If it had not been for the problem with the high-pitched fan noise, the T495s would have received our unconditional recommendation.
What's your experience with the fan nosie? Cheers!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No issues with the fan at all
This can be a simple call to Lenovo Singapore
Still.... we Have to look at the total number of people who posted their comments about T495s.
How many % of the users actually complaint about the Fan?
If it was only like a handful out of a few thousands... Then it's normal
But if the number is like every 5 to 6 out of 100... Then there is something really, really wrong with Lenovo QA & QC n they should be fired instantly

Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think review on noise is very subjective. Some people are more sensitive to noise for example.
I would expect the fan noise to be audible, which is not uncommon for laptops. It will be higher pitch due to the slim body of the laptop, thus, smaller/ slimmer laptop fan."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Waiting for their promo to offload those old stock for new chip
Sent from Rem Best Grill using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am not expecting big cuts in prices, especially for the E series since its been very attractively priced. Instead I feel the new series may be more expensive because just like what we observed on the desktop, AMD is trying to shake off the value oriented option perspective. While their desktop chips are still very competitively priced against the Intel parts, it is indeed not as cheap as the older Ryzen 1 and 2 series."
Lenovo Thinkpad,i more gian the t series due to the build quality
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is it still good? Or now its Lenovo DNA
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If I go for the T series, its mostly because it is more portable and gives me better screen options. Not too sure if the quality is significantly better though."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Sorry for the noob question but I've really been out of the notebook game for years and I urgently need a new laptop due the new work from home arrangements due to the Coronavirus.
Are Thinkpad T series with 10th gen Intel processors available in SG with ready stock? The usual big few player websites doesn't seem to have much love for Thinkpads. Thanks!

Lenovo Thinkpad,Available for T490 based on Lenovo SG website
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lookout for those laptop under fast delivery and take note the number of days that that it will take for delivery. Fastest is 2 days, but are generally the more pricey models and you cannot customize."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Got both the E and T... the T is definitely better build than the E series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yea.. looking very promising!
hope the COVID-19 doesn't delay the release!
can't wait"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Went to their website liao. Fastest is 2 days sua la, already need to work on Monday liao.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you need it by Monday, then online stores will not be an option for you because they generally take at least 2 business days to get the product to your place."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I feel the difference between the 2 boils down mostly to the size & weight. You have more customization option when it comes to the screen and camera on the T series, but that's about it from my observation."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"my nb aso all usb-c , what you guys use as 'thumbdrive' ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Probably can use those USB-A to usb-c adapter
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I'm using Samsung T5 for bigger files and multiple Sandisk SDCZ43
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not all adapters are created equal though. I bought a few different USB-A / USB C adapters/cables and some are only able to sustain USB 2.1 speeds. While some indicate clearly they are USB 2 only, it's not always the case."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"is this usb-c ? how is the speed?
I use the scandisk and speed over my adaptor is horrendous"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The Sandisk is type A USB 3.0, 90+ MB/s write and 130+ MB/s read. Never tried it with the good adapter which I left in office.
T5 is type C USB 3.1, I get 380 ~ 420 MB/s read/write large ISO with it.  With the adapter, the T5 gets about 90% vs direct. The adapters I use are USB-C one end T5, USB-A the other end  for laptop/ USB dock.
edit: I think this is the good one I'm using, based on my online orders history"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I get like 1-2mb/s sustained  for my usb-a over adaptor. so high chance is my adaptor CMI?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeah, sounds like CMI adapter. You gotta check the adapter states explicitly it is USB 3.0 or 3.1 speed. If you see USB 2.0 or ""fast USB"", or 480Mbps, then it is not going to give you more than ~20MBps from my experiences."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"then it should be the adaptor , 20/7 mb/s
maybe should get the usb-c scandisk type.."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually if there is nothing wrong with the laptop/ desktop, best not to meddle with firmware. I've been experiencing some issues with the laptop, and therefore, decided to take the plunge. So far this firmware seems ok and I have not experience the issues."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Usually after BIOS update, recommend to load Factory defaults.

Lenovo Thinkpad,The latest BIOS for my E485 seems to have fixed an issue where the system will randomly boot into repair mode at startup. At least I have not seen it happen after I updated.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Any ryzen gaming laptop coming ? With 1660ti or 2060?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"In SG have model like Asus TUF FX505DT, Ryzen 5 3550H Geforce 1660TI.
Challenger should have but the specs I share may not be same.
It's a rare model since AMD laptop are not popular in retail space."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can take some pics of your x395? How long have u own it?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes I agree. While AMD is getting more popular, finding a laptop with AMD chip in the big electronics companies like Challenger, Best Denki, Harvey Norman, Courts, etc, is still quite challenging. The most you find runs a Ryzen APU, and not exactly a high end model. Singaporeans will still mainly go for a brand they feel that is more reputable I guess."

Lenovo Thinkpad,So bad! Did they offer further discount for the long wait?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Looks cool. Let us know on the lead time!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Unlikely, haha these things have to demand one. They didnt even have the courtesy to apologize and inform on the delay"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Frankly speaking, I will still go for the ThinkPad E595. The i5 10210U is nothing new and just an overclocked i5 8xxx or 9xxx. Graphic wise, it is still rubbish relative the to Vega 8 GPU on the 3500U. Unless the Intel processor comes with a dedicated graphics like a minimal of Radeon 530 or Nvidia MX130, it is not attractive.
Warranty wise, I think its a year for the Acer. At least you have the option of 3 years onsite warranty with the ThinkPad. Only deal breaker now is the long wait time. I cancelled my order recently because of this reason as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Quite unlikely they will offer further discount since the laptop is already very discounted for the specs and they have already charged your credit card for the amount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Looking to get a windows laptop for microsoft office - excel/word etc. Currently using Apple.
Would like to get thoughts between ThinkPad X395/T495s vs. Yoga series C740?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,ThinkPad for me. My current ThinkPad T410 still superb after 8 years.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"X series light and long battery, T series business, yoga series light.
X or T should be suitable for you."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If I upgrade my own ssd, ram and m2, will it void the warranty?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Unlikely, unless you damaged any components as a result of tampering with the laptop. I did noticed that in some reviews, Lenovo seems to have slapped a warranty sticker over the NVME SSD screw, so if that is the case, then you cannot upgrade the NVME SSD without voiding warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Couldnt wait for it to land.
Ended up getting a 2nd hand dell xps15 9550. Came with 1tb ssd. Got it for a good price."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Any body knows of any coupon for lenovo?

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just ordered my x395 on Friday Night.
a few questions
1 Can I reformat the whole OS then install all the drivers/software from the site? or are some only available preinstalled
Reason why I am doing this is coz I have a 100% clean build of win 10 Pro 0 bloatware or m$ ""free"" games, software, etc. Will want to clean wipe then install only the drivers, and Lenovo utilities.
2 is the micro-SD card reader also a nano Sim reader? can I use a data sim card?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"There arent many pre-installed software in the default. The notable one is the Vantage. I reformat and and reinstall the OS and the drivers from Lenovo when I received my T495. Before that, you have to create the bootable thumb drive. Instructions are found on Lenovo site.
The microSD reader and SIM reader are different. The SIM reader is only functional if you have selected this option during the order and the modem will be installed in the machine. Otherwise, it will just be a SIM card slot. Not sure if the same goes to your X395."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No problem, my suggested steps:
- Prepare the OS installation USB
- Prepare and download the drivers from Lenovo
- During OS install, do not connect to internet.
This is to prevent OS from installing the driver on it's own.
- After OS install, than load all the driver before connecting
to internet.
- Utilities like Lenovo Vantage and etc. can load after everything is done."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yeah.. I will definitely reinstall vantage after I reformat. I already have a clean build of windows 10 ver 1903. advantages of working in IT haha... we clean install all PCs when we get them
sim card slot? I didn't have that option. only WWAN which I did not select.
I saw some posts here that they have internet access with simcard. hence im confused haha

Yup... that is my plan. I know drivers can be found on the support page of your laptop. Just enter serial number."
Lenovo Thinkpad,What abt using Windows 10 recovery function where u can format windows 10 so without reinstalling the entire OS?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"That one is different, is basically wipe any data as well as program and driver to original state.
Useful if you want to sell the PC without leaving any data behind as well as any issue reset will be useful.
Reinstall typically is for better performance for new PC since most use factory image which comes with bloatware.
As well as when there is new Windows build than typically reinstall the OS will be recommended."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Now is ver 1909 not 1903.
Lenovo Thinkpad,I know.. use windows update to get 1909 lol..
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Recommend you to build a new Windows USB Installer with build 1909.
Save time from updating to 1909 as well as when Windows update,
it will update from 1909/concurrent period.
1903 and previous build might take longer to update along with it's
own patches at the time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"idk if the microsoft site's 1909 is clean..
the 1903 is what my office uses hence its ""certified clean"""
Lenovo Thinkpad,No problems. I did a clean install after swapping out the SSD on my E485. Works fine.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Microsoft direct ISO builder are as clean as it can get. Unless your office using specialized ISO version with stripped features.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi not sure if this is off topic.. would like to know from people here, in terms of durability/ ""steady laptop"", can help to differentiate the thinkpad t495 vs the hp elitebook 745 g6?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thinkpad will be better.
HP Elitebook cost more, quality wise especially keyboard Thinkpad still is better."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"if u ask this in a hp thread, they say hp is better. if u ask this here, then they will say lenovo is better.
anyway, lenovo ThinkPad are notoriously known for its durability."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Saw x395 review damn good.... ticked on all the checkboxes ....can even use for gaming
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I didn't actually see an amd elitebook thread so i threw the question here.. was hoping on a more balanced feedback.. apparently the elitebook doesn't have any review for it. Hence have to ask.
I am biased towards lenovo too.. but the t495 build seems similar to 745 G6 and has two sodimms compared to t495's 1 sodimm."
Lenovo Thinkpad,My laptop has been shipped. Expected arrival end of this week.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Is the shipping time accurate? shows that its shipping out on 11 May!!! and expected to arrive on 15 May...
VR has alr been shipped tho so... I guess I can play VR during the lockdown $1 for the VR if you're asking"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Any comments to get the base e595 with dummy hdd and upgrade ram and ssd?
Will it cause warranty issues later on?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Objectively, I avoid HP laptops for retail consumers due to the poor experiences. However the Elitebook targeted for corporate users seems to be significantly better in terms of reliability and quality. I was using one in my company that last well over 3 years without any problems. The current ThinkPad I am using is more on the budget end my personal laptop, so will not be a good comparison for me to make."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hi thanks for sharing.. upon looking at it the amd 745 G6 isn't offered in SG, and it is alot pricier than the thinkpad counterpart.
for this month, it is just hard to decide, waiting for the zen2 mobiles for a better worth it buy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Whats a good price to pay for 2nd-hand T470s?
Lenovo Thinkpad,I've been researching quite a bit and I've come to a conclusion... T490s vs T495s. If both are around the same price. Which would be better? I understand that the intel T490s has better battery life. Anyone have real life experience with this 2 comparison in terns of battery life differences?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Intel if same price. Battery battery and has Thunderbolt 3 for added expansion capability such as eGPU. Only thing you lose is modular WiFi card since it's soldered on, unlike the AMD version which is a removable card."
Lenovo Thinkpad,intel has better battery life?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"same here.. ordered a ""ready to ship"" laptop.. it said within 2 weeks..
now it shows May 15.. feel like scammed.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think when you say same price, what are the specs that you are looking at? Generally any Intel laptop will cost more than one that runs AMD chips. And it is also generally true that the current AMD APU is not as power efficient as compared to an Intel equivalent. However the AMD integrated GPU is significantly faster. So it depends on your usage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,i think nowadays they ship faster. i ordered 2 weeks ago then yesterday informed me that they have shipped and scheduled to arrive this saturday.
Lenovo Thinkpad,what freebies are you guy able to ask to waive off?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"So my AR/VR kit, bags have arrived.

but not the laptop -_-

now ETA is June smlj sia...

from May, to Apr now June.. help la
who can I call/contact to F?
I alr emailed them"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think its a shortage of parts, not just limited to Lenovo. I recently purchased an Acer laptop 25th Mar with Intel i5 8250U also got delayed till early May. They eventually sent an email that due to overwhelming demand, my order is in backlog, and my order got cancelled."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I went to check the online site again today.
the only ""shortage"" at the customization page is the Ethernet dongle and 65W charger. Both of which are actually external devices..
the cpu I chose doesn't show a shortage. neither does the ssd the 256gb one has a waiting time. but I chose 512.
also, did you cancel the order or did they cancel it for you?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Waiting for third generation Ryzen 4000 series to be inside the ThinkPad, will hoot the highest spec! Hopefully Lenovo will offer these."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone uses this laptop?Hows the performance and any issue encountered?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Same for me. Bought the t495s estimated delivery date in June. Ask them to cancel but they ask me if I wanna proceed with a gst waive
Lenovo Thinkpad,Looking at around the same spec. T490s Intel i5 vs T495s Ryzen 5. Just that intel model Im thinking of buying a slightly second hand at around the same price as a new t495s
Lenovo Thinkpad,"True, but they cannot ship you a laptop without a charger."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I actually don't think you need the highest specs, especially when you are looking at the 15W chips. Most should find the R7 4700U with HT/ SMT sufficient and have a good balance between a good CPU and GPU. Most 15W chips are simply too power starved to maintain a good boost when both the CPU and GPU are under load. They can likely boost up to 25W, but depends on the cooling solution."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"did u email or call them? My ETA keeps changing so idk what to do anymore...

true.. but how can chargers be OOS? isn't it paired with the laptop?
EDIT: Just called them. Apparently there's a CPU shortage. the rest of the parts are available. Also, I told them to mark my account as corporate as I do make purchases on behalf of my company at times
EDIT 2: emails still 0 replies after 3 sends... And my bank charged me today. Does this mean my laptop has been shipped?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Looking good..
hope thinkpad don't disappoint."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyone received the E595 without backlit keyboard  LED icon on spacebar , my order mentioned the product came with backlit 6-row ultranav, was shown on website during order, today it does not show it. False advertising?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My Lenovo laptop is on its way here. Upon receiving, i plan to reinstalll fresh windows to remove some bloatwares.
Do I need the windows key or it will automatically activate once I log into windows with internet connection?
Driver wise, I should go into Lenovo website to automatically update most of the drivers but directly go to AMD website to get chipset drivers and radeon software right?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The key is registered to your laptop. If you want to play it safe, you can log in first before reinstalling to check if it is activated.
As for chipset driver, yes you can get it from AMD's site."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I thought the E series don't come with backlit keyboard?
Lenovo Thinkpad,the win10 license is hardcoded to the bios
Lenovo Thinkpad,"that is correct for E series AMD.
E series intel has backlit kb, but if anybody is asking whether can use the same backlit kb and install on the AMD model, answer is no."
Lenovo Thinkpad,thanks all. i need to remove all the bloatware that's why i intend to reinstall windows.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I suggest getting from your own laptop's serial number page as its customised.. But ya.. I will do a first time login before wiping too
yes. but you can upgrade OS too..

I Plan to do the same too"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"anyone can advise? not shipped but billed alr.. -_-
called them 4 times, emailed 4 times with 0 replies..
supposed to get callback from sales dept but no reply.
idk what to do anymore.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Tell bank to cancel transaction.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"will I still get the laptop?
also, what if bank asks for transcation cancellation slip? I've got that before"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"They should whack this on the thinkpad extreme series, right now their T-series do not offer 4k screen on Singapore site."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The bank will only hold the payment while they investigate. They will not cancel the payment because clearly the order is not cancelled, and they are not authorized to do that. Unless otherwise it is a fraudulent transaction."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"They will surely ask you for proof why you need to cancel the transaction, and will also investigate with the seller. They can't just cancel the payment without validation.
Unfortunately, this is common practice. I've recently placed an order on Harvey Norman, and they did the same. They charged my card, then drop me and email to notify me that the item's delivery is in backlog and will need up to 30 days to deliver. I checked the order status online, and the dates got moved for more than a month. They took 2 weeks to respond to my query and cancelled the order without confirming with me. So now I am waiting for the refund, that takes up to 30 days due to the COVID19 situation."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"wtf is going on man.. is it so hard to reply email? I sent Lenovo and cannot get anything
btw, ship date changed to 22nd Apr but I don't know who to trust anymore..
also, other than drivers etc.. is Lenovo vantage the only useful software that I need to download after wiping clean? Can I not download the rest of the software?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Generally most coy/office are not operating as well as overwhelm
thus either delay in response or no response at all.
Depend on model, example E595 other than Vantage, software like hotkeys integration This is for KB shortcuts as well as intelligent thermal solution."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yeah.. but no excuse to not read emails.. even im doing IT support and I need to read emails tho I cannot physically support lol..
I bought X395"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The extreme series will use the HS or H series.
U is unlikely
since U only 15w.
extreme like its name will likely use 35w or 45w chips.
Provided they even come out with AMD versions for the extreme."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hi, does anyone find the text display in x395 blurry, especially on some applications. is there any way to resolve this? Thanks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Try update the driver from Lenovo?
Their latest driver is 3rd April so quite recent."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For X395, I could suggest:
- Hotkey feature for keyboard shortcuts
- Power management driver
Other than that will be just drivers for most of the devices like
graphic, WIFI and etc."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lenovo fn keys are weird.. I just set the default..
fn+key for features.
alt+f keys for normal..
supposed to press both or something idk..
power management driver is included in the page right? Im referring to software lol.. other than vantage"
Lenovo Thinkpad,The shopback are good for online purchase too
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The performance of the gpu for 4800U is quite close to a mx250 from nvidia.
tasty indeed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think its certainly catching up, but should not be anywhere that close to the MX250 in games. This is especially so when looking at the 15W version due to power and thermal constraints when both CPU and GPU are under load. If it is a R7 4800U paired with an MX250 as a comparison, the CPU can take the full 15W, and GPU an additional 25W, though it will be more challenging to keep both components cool."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"then again, I wouldn't mind less power consumption in an ultra portable.. I have a desktop to game"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I don't disagree. In fact I am eyeing a laptop with R7 4700U. It should be more than sufficient for my usage.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Its bumper that none can add up to 32gb ram....
Lenovo Thinkpad,Which models can't bump RAM up to 32GB?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think the CS are scared of replying since I am sure they would have gotten a lot of angry customers chasing them for status. After all, they are the messengers and not able to really influence the factory to send it out soon. Another 2 more days man, hope they really ship it out.
As for drivers, I got most from Lenovo except for the AMD drivers. If any updates, Vantage will take care of it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"why cant get amd drivers from Lenovo itself?
also, finally got my tracking number"
Lenovo Thinkpad,If order from lenovo website need pay for custom gst?
Lenovo Thinkpad,X395 max is 16gb
Lenovo Thinkpad,How long from order before you get tracking number?
Lenovo Thinkpad,6 core 4500u uses same amount of power as 4 core 3500u but 40% faster
Lenovo Thinkpad,"20 days
u pay online when u buy"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wah.. That long.. I just ordered over the weekend... So at least 3 weeks wait for it...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Its factored into the price you pay when you checkout on Lenovo Singapore's website.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You can, but the AMD drivers on Lenovo's site may not be as up to date."
Lenovo Thinkpad,can share the link? im using integrated cards for GPU. so I thought just download the chipset drivers and it will be fine
Lenovo Thinkpad,"impressive.
can't wait for 4800u or 4900u !
near 60 fps versus 35+ fps  for 3500u in the game."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Same vega gpu. only 5% improvement
Lenovo Thinkpad,"5%?
based on the video numbers, doesn't seem like it?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,The improvements are definitely greater than 5% despite the drop in 2 CUs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyway, just wanted to give people buying Lenovo laptops a headsup. It seems that even with the extended warranty, the battery warranty is still limited to a year. So if your battery starts acting up like on my E485, then you are on your own."
Lenovo Thinkpad,is there any way to remove the battery and use the laptop on adapter?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Don't think so, some laptop can adjust the setting either through Lenovo Power management or BIOS.
There should be a setting to change to always plug in or so."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The battery is built in, so its not convenient to take them out easily. I also feel its pointless to take the battery out for a laptop. If you dont use them often, it will degrade too.
Moreover, you can set the max charge to say 80% and to recharge only when it falls to 70% or less. This way, the battery wont charge all the time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Still waiting for its tech refresh
Sent from Rem Best Grill using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"when zephyrus g14 will b available?
price will b <2k?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ideally yes since I am expecting Renoir gaming laptops to be in the USD 1000 segment. After all, all Renoir laptops are in the low to mid range gaming laptops. The top end RTX are unfortunately exclusive to Intel. Hopefully AMD can release their higher end RX series graphics in Renoir based laptops soon."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Laptop finally arrived
.
Bought on 3rd Apr,
Just reached 30 mins ago..
gonnna charge the batteries first then full wipe. after that can enjoy"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Congrats! At least it arrived in 3 weeks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wooohoooo!!!
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Drives wiped. Fresh OS installed and patched. will install the rest of what I need tomorrow
Lenovo Thinkpad,hopefully comes soon because china lenovo already selling 4500u
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lenovo Yoga
May start to sell in china, 4999 rmb about 1k SGD
AMD version only got 1 heatpipe though
Hope thinkpad got good heat management.
Acer 4700u performance"
Lenovo Thinkpad,How do you do that? Wipe and fresh install?
Lenovo Thinkpad,You can buy additional battery warranty for up to 3-5 years depending on ur basic warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Make sure you boot into your laptop beforehand.
Go download the Microsoft program for Upgrade or Make USB boot drive.
Then use that boot drive to install fresh Windows 10. It'll auto match your Home or Pro Type.... else there's a universal CD key for you to key in the product key page.
MAKE SURE to be offline when you do it, then it'll upgrade your OS from HOME to PRO.
After that, just log back online.
That's only if you have the PRO version of Windows 10."
Lenovo Thinkpad,i thing good about thinkpad is they tend to have stock for old laptops.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just checked with the Lenovo Singapore CS, and they confirmed that there will be updates with Renoir next month on their products."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"started selling in UK
max config is around 1300 for 15 inch
ram unsure if dual channel though"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"May? good news
can't wait to see what thinkpad can offer"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is the discussion in this thread the Lenovo Xiaoxin series?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hope they will have high end amd high-end thinkpad with high resolution screen. They tend to sell lower stuff and poor screen in SG. E.g., Extreme gen 2, if you buy i7 you cannot customised and most screens only FHD.
Come on give us a Ryzen 9 4000 thinkpad with a 4k screen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Which one is likely to be more durable？
T495 or X395
Both advertised to be very durable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I don't feel that a 4K screen is required on a laptop. Especially when Windows 10 is quite poor in scaling. I prefer a decent IPS screen with faster refresh rate and good brightness.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Between the 2, you should be considering the screen size and weight. Build wise is usually good for the T and X series."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It could be dual channel, but I noticed 2 things about Lenovo of late,
1. 1 stick of ram to upgrade, the other is soldered
2. They tend to gimp the ram speed on the lower end, i.e. Ryzen 3xxx supports up to 2666mhz of ram, but is limited to 2400 on the E series. Not too sure about the T series though.
If the options are not good, I will look elsewhere this time. Still somewhat disappointed with the 1 year battery warranty. Need to read up from other manufacturers to see if the same is applicable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"144Hz refresh rate.
1~3ms response time.
100% Adobe sRGB.
450+ Nits Brightness."
Lenovo Thinkpad,What model is this? Lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yay. better hold off one month...
also next years cpu will finally have upgraded gpu
https://wccftech.com/amds-next-gen-cezanne-ryzen-5000-apus-detailed-rumored-to-feature-zen-3-cores-rdna2-navi-23-gpu/"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Well, can't chase after technology all the time man. I feel the current Renoir is good enough largely due to the benefits of the shrink from 12nm basically a refined 14nm to a 7nm. Ryzen 5 is a architecture improvement on both the CPU and GPU, so should see better benefits."
Lenovo Thinkpad,450 nits is very bright though. I feel 300 nits is good enough for me. A good and high refresh rate IPS screen will be good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"See Lenovo or asus one fit my budget bo, leaning towards to asus due to the design
Sent from Rem Is Best Waifu using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yea, a good color IPS good brightness at full HD for 15 or 14 inch is definately great."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My decision will depend on the cooling solution. As it stands, Lenovo tend to use a single fat or dual thin heatpipe to draw heat away from the processor. This is the case for the E series at least. I feel the cooling solution is average, if not on the poor side as it gets hot quite quickly. The likes of Acer Swift 3 is the same if I am not mistaken."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Their screen is always look quality in terms of sGRB and Adobe RGB. Moe and more people are emphasing on good, bright screen, and it's one of the thing we look at daily besides the keyboard."
Lenovo Thinkpad,only high end model has got 100% sRGB and 100% Adobe RGB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"300 is just nice for indoor with lights... outdoor with sun a bit too dim

Lenovo will last longer than asus. esp the thinkpads"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My company is using all Asus and slow down after a while. End lasy year I hoot 5 thinklad for them during sales, and they chua tio thinking it's expensive, in fact it cost the same as Asus with higher specs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I stop supporting Asus laptop.
Mainly due to after sales support isn't that good.
For business recommend get brands like Dell or Lenovo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,yeah.. most companies I see these days use dell or Lenovo. occasionally HP..
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Most companies go for the one that quotes them the lowest, or best deal. Asus is unlikely to break into the corporate laptop market that easily. The big 3 if I am not mistaken are Lenovo, HP and Dell."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The screen looks better only because 4K laptop monitors are deemed as high end range. In fact, generally any laptop monitor above 1080p, i.e. 1440p, etc, will be expected to come with better color reproduction and brighter backlight."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I read this comment

Make quite alot of sense that being so thin, won't it matters to the durability whether in term of airflow in the internal or from breakage when it drops.
The ethernet port is useful imo.
The only thing disappointing is can only get the 3 cell battery
Other comments suggest that X395 is using the new carbon material that is lighter.
I'm also wondering is the X395 more cramp than the T495.
I've read some reviews on the blue screen on the T495 though,not sure if it is fixed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,X395 is magnesium.. and I really love the lightweight
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For budget.. this is really good.
can't wait to see thinkpad T series with 4800u
hope they don't gimp the cooling."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"At first i counted the T495s out cause it's labelled $15xx onward, but base on my config, only $100-$150 more exp than the X395/T495
Look like it's in my top list now.
The battery life is better than the X395.
The screen is 14"" 400nits.
X395's highest 400nits has an eprivacy filter which i don't want"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"There are lesser laptops with good sRGB and adobe RGB settings, as they cost a bit more. The lenovo ideapad with 4500 only has a 64% sGRB adn 48% Adobe RGB while the Macbook air had 97% sRGB and 78% Adobe RGB. Lenovo could have added another hundred to make a better screen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,what is the x395 sGRA and RGB percentage?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"the only downside is its screen nia, otherwise will be perfect"
Lenovo Thinkpad,wait for higher end model  more $  of course.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wait for Yoga Slim 7... that one got 100% sRGB
Lenovo Thinkpad,"See the updated E and the T series first
Sent from Rem Is Best Waifu using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,uk has really good deal on the new ryzen
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The base model not very enticing... need to do some additional customization.
Max out the spec cost around 1500 SGD"
Lenovo Thinkpad,can't wait for the T series.
Lenovo Thinkpad,To be honest the max out spec @ 1500sgd isn't really too bad of a deal if you need it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The IdeaPad 5 series is a step up from the usual ThinkPad E series. I am using an IdeaPad 5 with Intel processor and I would say the build quality is quite good. But I feel if its 1.5K for the max out specs, it is on the pricey side, but still a decent deal considering you are rocking an 8c/16t processor in there."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This is likely to cost more than the IdeaPad 5. And hopefully, the cooler will be enough to allow the CPU to stretch itself to its full potential."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You should be able to customize the screen to a better and brighter one, though you will not be getting cutting edge screens at the low to mid end range of laptops."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Another downside is that it cannot output 4k@60hz... Only 4k@30hz. To me this is a deal-breaker in 2020
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yea, if can be cheaper will be a solid buy"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hope they got massive discount like last time
confirm hot cakes!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I feel it is a PC manufacturers' problem in this case. Just like on the desktop where most mobo makers stick to HDMI 1.4, and DP 1.2, instead of going with the updated HDMI 2.0 and DP 1.4 standards. There are handful of mobos with HDMI 2.0, but not common for the AMD chipsets."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The price will certainly be better for laptops with AMD processors. Just that while this is new, and the only good 6 and 8 cores U series processor, PC manufacturer will take the opportunity to charge a premium, i.e. not providing much discount. Unless you don't mind waiting till later in the year to take the plunge."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"not enough volume to support ba..
who will use onboard graphics these days. those who only use onboard don't even know the diff between hdmi 1.4 and hdmi 2.0."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"very good
4800 looking more delicious by the day.
hope no gimp!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think hor if go for U proc
better get the slowest of all  which is still faster than most intel gen
because I feel usually U the fan also beh zai one"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"looks like I bought my x395 too early..
. but ok la. 1.3k a bit too hard to pass up.
3500u, 512ssd, 16gb ram"
Lenovo Thinkpad,a lot of ppl say wait for renoir but........
Lenovo Thinkpad,"x395 is lightweight so I don't think you will regret.
Successor to this model I don't think will be announce so soon."
Lenovo Thinkpad,yes. I bought mainly for the light weight...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Successor to the X395 isn't the X13 AMD meh?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"3300u, 3500u or 3700u"
Lenovo Thinkpad,waiting for high end AMD Thinkpad but don't think it will happen anytime soon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo will never sell gaming laptops
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The Legion line is aimed at gamers. There's also the L340, which was a low cost gaming laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"AMD mobile for so long, no manufacturer have push for high end.
Generally AMD laptop are found in low cost or mid range laptops
but no high end."
Lenovo Thinkpad,GTA is so playable evewn with renoir U
Lenovo Thinkpad,"whoa very impressive.
if they can pair the 4800U with decent cooling.
this is gonna be a great AIO desktop or laptop"
Lenovo Thinkpad,a taste of what's to come?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think with U , sure kena throttle......for intel at least la"
Lenovo Thinkpad,i think i just get the 4500U is sufficient liao
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I also think so..
I'm also thinking of something like
AsRock Deskmini A300 version  with Renoir A400 ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not for gaming but higher specs ThinkPad, like putting Ryzen 9, and good solid screen for content creation. Don't really want to buy P2 even now that intel had lowered their CPU prices by a lot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,seems like there is no more ecoupon that can be used now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,im using 2400G quite satisfied with performance. can play guild wars 2 on low at 50fps 4k resolution
Lenovo Thinkpad,wait for it to update to renoir should be better i Feel
Lenovo Thinkpad,save this as bookmark. once can order it will appear
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yup better. Good thing about laptop and desktop apu is that it has vce for gpu acceleration when encoding video, something not found in low end nvidia like mx250"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just want to check,
does the monitor that comes with the laptop support HDR?
or how can I check it?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"4500u compared
15w and 25w
5 deg C/1 to 2 fps difference"
Lenovo Thinkpad,think for 4500U leaving it at 15w better
Lenovo Thinkpad,That's why I can't wait for the desktop version actually. Most laptops unfortunately comes with poor cooling solution.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Its not limited to Lenovo though. The same goes to all the PC manufacturers. The top of the range is only limited to Intel processors, so you get a sense there is something fishy here."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I read about it sometime back, but it is very rare. Most are limited to 400 nits, so HDR 400, which is negligible visually. I believe even the laptop OLED monitors are also limited to 400 nits based on specs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It is interesting that its only 2 FPS difference. In the video, the CPU seems to be sustained at a much higher clockspeed on the 25W test. So the bottleneck is probably the GPU in this case."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"OEM agreements I guess. you scratch my back, I scratch yours? I would build my own laptop tbh. but sg does not have that service.
Mine is 300 nits.. but its not just about the brightness. Its about the color gamut, or clarity right? instead of 8-bit its like 10-bit.. but idk if my monitor has. how to check?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Most build yourself laptops unfortunately are not as customizable as a PC. Take Eurocom for example, they specializes in this sort of customization on a laptop. However if you realized, the level of customization is still very limited.
For HDR, I don't think there is a way to check if it is HDR compliant. You are correct to say that HDR is not just about brightness, but also the color reproduction of the screen. VESA standard suggests a minimal brightness level of 400 nits."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Colour gamut can test using a colorimeter. For Lenovo laptops, most are 45% NTSC or 72% NTSC 100% sRGB. think the 4k displays all exceed 72% NTSC.
Bit depth can check in display properties... But think most are still 8 bit. 10 bit simply means less colour banding when displaying gradients."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hope to see Lenovo Singapore bringing in AMD Renoir based laptops soon.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"100% sRGB means 100% colour accuracy?
I guess aftershock is ""build yourself"".. but its gaming only.. they sg doesn't have a DIY for laptops like PCs.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"T495 400 nits panel has got good sRGB of 98.6% and an adobe RGB of 63.5%. Adobe RGB is not import if you are not doing offset printing.
I do hope that have 500 nits with 100% sGRB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I bought X395. how do I check that?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Aftershock's customization is not much of a customization. They have regressed over the years when it comes to customization.
As I understand, DIY laptops should be very rare, and should be very limited in terms of customization, unlike PCs. This is because different specs/ features tend to have a different motherboard design, which in turn affects cooling solution and chassis design. If ever you find one that allows you to customize freely, it will likely cost a lot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yea man! can't wait to see those thinkpads!
hope they don't disappoint!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I've been checking everyday since the start of May.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"seems like no high end AMD cpu variant for thinkpad
was hoping maybe the p series or xtreme series got the new amd cpu"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I believe its Intel at work in the background. If so, what a dirty way of hindering competition."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Might not be solely the reason.
Lenovo might have signed different exclusive deals with Intel based on different product lines. Example T series 14 inches and 15 inches may have different contracts. 14 inches exclusive deal ended and so Lenovo brought in AMD.
Another reason might be, Lenovo signed a deal to buy certain number of 15W, 25W and 45W CPU every year in order to secure CPU numbers. They might not be able to use up all 45W CPU from Intel and no point to buy more from AMD 45W variant if they cannot move on low volume products.
Intel has a lack of CPU supply if any of you follow the news. Big players like Dell, HP, Apple and Lenovo would likely sign deals that supply them certain numbers of CPU for not just 1 year, but typically 2-3 years. AMD scores product design wins mainly are the higher volume 15W Ryzen 3300U/3500U/3700U.
If I am Lenovo or one of the big players, I can afford to sell 10% of the sales from AMD Ryzen to 1 build up expertise in AMD system, 2 test market response, 3 meet market demand and 4 pressure Intel to give better renewal deals.
Remember, many people dont know AMD. Reliability is a factor. You need a certain discount to attract buyers. A similar priced Intel whether on desktop or laptop can command a higher premium than AMD as seen in T series thinkpad.
I have no doubt 45W Ryzen will come to ThinkPad T15 and P15 series in 1-2 years when corporate clients look for replacement units after having 2-3 years using Ryzen. Management approving wider use of Ryzen systems will be happy to take on 45W systems that command higher reliability.
If you are running a business and need critical support, would you use Singtel services or Grid Mobile?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"AMD Mobile products have not been popular since early days of Turion
till AMD FX Excavator CPU not the famous AMD FX-60 socket 939 which decimate Intel back in the early days.
CPU have been weak and behind Intel counterpart so the selling point
isn't there. AMD perception have been tainted as slow and hot for so long
thus many will not risk it to buy one. However the pricing
is one factor some will get it as most model falls below $1k.
Market availability is also another question as AMD is exclusive
to US and China mainly. Only recent AMD Ryzen laptop than
more and more such laptop became to surface.
However most model are either entry/mid but no high end
have surface. Models like Dell G5 SE AMD Ryzen, Lenovo Legion 5 so far no
news whether SG have them or not.
I only know Dell SG do not bring in AMD based desktop/laptop as sales margin are generally poor.
Asus as well as Lenovo are actively bringing in AMD Ryzen laptop followed by Acer and HP.
I have owned AMD based laptops from Turion till the last one the AMD A10 series. Generally they are average performing laptop which cost less than $1k.
I stop buying AMD laptops before Ryzen laptops were available here.
I myself also hope to get a decent AMD 8 Core mobile laptop just waiting for the right model."
Lenovo Thinkpad,what about Renoir 4k haha???
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi new to the forum here.
I will be starting school in July and was thinking of getting a E495/E595. I am looking at Ryzen 3500 but hesitant to buy now as the Ryzen 4000 seems to be launching soon and Im waiting for a dip in price for the 3500 series. Any suggestions on how much it would drop in price?
Given the supply chain disruption now due to covid, do you guys suggest I wait it out for the 4000 or just go ahead with the purchase now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Agreed. I recall having an AMD laptop quite a number of years back, but its been so long that I can't recall when as well. The reason for getting it was due a decent integrated graphics and low price. But I also recalled that it runs really hot. Those were tough years for AMD because Intel is always ahead of them when it comes to having an advance fab. I feel detaching themselves from Globabl Foundry actually helped AMD in the longer run."
Lenovo Thinkpad,No harm waiting since it is expected to be available for order this month.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"As mentioned, I recommend waiting. I just checked the price of current E495 and noticed it has gone up substantially. I think even with base specs with a Ryzen 5 3500U, it will cost you over 1K. Also, they removed some important upgrades like the IPS monitor option is gone."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ok, will heed your advice and wait out for the a few more weeks. I also realized that about the customization option of E495! They downgraded the FHD IPS panel to a HD TN panel with no customization option now!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Either way you have wait, order will need at least 2 weeks or 4 weeks.
I don't think price will drop a lot due to pandemic."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is there any promo code for Lenovo? I only found a 3% off online.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The integrated Radeon Graphic was one of the key selling despite
the weak CPU.
Another issue with later generation AMD laptop in particular A10/FX based
laptops was drivers especially those with dual graphics.
I had the Asus X550DP the dual graphics mean IGP + discrete graphic
but keep crashing most of the time.
No driver was released to fix such issue thus I dump the laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,means the new versions are coming
Lenovo Thinkpad,"That is correct. If I am not wrong, there are 2 versions of this graphic switching tech from AMD. One of the Lenovo laptop I owned back then had an Intel processor with an AMD graphic card. For that laptop, I recall I had to manually switch graphics, unlike Optimus that switches automatically most of the time.
The second gen was an auto switching one but it was very bad. I think they have no $$$ as they were getting hit left right center by both Intel and Nvidia."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I was thinking the same. To be honest, the wait is very painful. Lol."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"actually what is the price difference btw a entry monitor to a good one?
100 top up enough?
So far I've yet to see renoirs with better screens"
Lenovo Thinkpad,close to mx350 performance
Lenovo Thinkpad,"you mean for the thinkpad options?
i'm guessing around that price also.
100-200"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think it should be < $1,500 if it ever comes but I think maybe looking at other brands too HP, Dell or Acer."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Price difference for a better monitor is not significant. However due to product segmentation, they may not offer you a better monitor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,let's if dell will pick this up or not
Lenovo Thinkpad,"if you ask me at that pricing... thinkpads are still better than the other brands u mentioned.
Somehow the overall build is just better than the rest.. others may look nicer but the build and quality.. thinkpads still top notch imo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Is it worth buying a second hand thinkpad without warranty? Saw a E495 3500U and 16GB RAM going at $650.
Anyone got experience in buying 2nd hand thinkpads? Is it easy to self-repair?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This integrated GPU is probably the most powerful at this point. I suspect it is due to the 7nm shrink that probably allow the GPU to run at a higher clockspeed, sustain at a higher clockspeed, and to a large extend, the inclusion of faster memory.
I am looking foward to see how the iGPU in actual gaming benchmark agains the MX350. I believe it will be faster than a MX250, but likely still trailing the MX350. Still for a 15W chip to perform closely to a 15W + 25W Intel solution is  a big deal. Nvidia certainly is aware scrambling to put up a new low power GPU in face of competitors' iGPU catching up with their aged GPU in the low power range."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"E495 is relative new model release last year, you can call to get
quote for warranty extension.
Not sure what do you mean self-repair?
Change RAM/SSD/HDD user still can do it, motherboard and LCD
best to let service center do it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"here u go. largely mx350 still comes out top.
but its not far behind
4800U plus good cooling will be quite a portable light gaming beast!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,if going for ultras i'm quite concern with throttling...
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This issue is unavoidable. Question is how bad will it throttle. If you read recent review of the Acer Swift 3 with the Ryzen 7 4700U, the cooling system is very bad. Even in my current E485, the heatsink is very small and you can clearly see it struggling to handle the heat."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"so is it possible to don't throttle?
for example my lenovo S730 yoga multitask zoom also kena"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"if they can pair the 4800u or 4800u with good cooling and dual channel.
beasty"
Lenovo Thinkpad,hope we won't have the pro options only..
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The throttling is really to help manage the heat, so I don't think it is ideal to stop it from throttling. All modern CPUs have a temperature in which it will shutdown to prevent permanent damage due to overheating. The throttling is meant to keep it from reaching that temp.
For my case, what I do to improve cooling are,
1. Replace the thermal compound - I am using Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut
2. Try and see if I can add some heatsink/ increase cooling surface area if space  in the laptop permits
3. Seal up gap between the heatsink and the exhaust if required - This will ensure hot air gets channeled out of the chassis directly and minimize hot air flowing back into the chassis
All these will help to a limited extend to allow a slightly longer boost. Throttling unfortunately is still inevitable."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yeah I saw this. What puts me off is the date. So I guess there may be delays in Renoir laptops.
Lenovo Thinkpad,I think usually ultrabooks very susah
Lenovo Thinkpad,covid covid
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For laptop u dun need to be on high clock speed all the time
Sent from Rem Is Best Waifu using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,you try zoom on... it kept my total cpu @ 20%
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It is true because the slimness means compromises made with cooling. However they can still make an effort to provide a decent cooling solution, i.e. dual heatsink fan cooler. Dual heatsink helps because it provides more surface area despite the thin heatsink. Low/ mid range thin laptops usually sport a single fan, a measly thin heatsink, and a single fat or 2 thin heatpipes. As a result, any load on the CPU will quickly bring the temps up drastically."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"agreed.. dual heatsink fan cooler..
dunno why they like to provide lousy cooling solutions"
Lenovo Thinkpad,so can i assume dell xps 13 is the better ultrabook??
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think it is confirmed for a June release. Hope they won't move the dates again.
While I agree that COVID will impact release dates, but I feel it is a poorly coordinated effort by AMD. They should first confirm if there are sufficient products to sell before officially announcing it. It is like vaporware now since only reviewers seems to have them. On the contrary Intel managed to get the new processors into machines that are available to purchase. Unless of course there are conspiracy theories that Intel is behind the delays."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, but it also comes with an eye watering price tag."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Tomshardware took the Acer Swift 3 apart. There you can see the poor cooling solution which is standard issue for most low power processors. Unfortunately what they did not show is how thin the heatsink is.
There is actually space for better cooling in this chassis, but of course they choose the cheap option."
Lenovo Thinkpad,damn.. was hoping a mid may release.
Lenovo Thinkpad,so if got 2 fans means half the battle won liao hor
Lenovo Thinkpad,I think can wait and see. The link seems to refer only to ThinkPad and not to IdeaPad. So perhaps you can still find an IdeaPad with an Renoir in it this month since it is already available for selected countries.
Lenovo Thinkpad,That means sustained performance should be better with more surface area for cooling.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I have the latest Dell XPS 9300 and it is hot AF even with the dual heatsink or whatever.
A bit regret paying so much for this. The saving grace is that Dell support is awesome. I accidentally scratched my screen somehow and broke my microsd slot long story--for some reason, my microSD card kept getting stuck inside and dell is replacing them for free under accidental damage..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I actually considered XPS13 before settling down for the thinkpad X395.
Apparently XPS' standards have dropped and quality too..
and the price is not worth it according to a few people I spoke to."
Lenovo Thinkpad,so probably need to search for vendor that has dual fans + good screen for the renoir 4k then?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"tbh, I don't see the point of 4K on a laptop. drains too much battery. 2k also considered too much alr on such a small screen.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"4k on renoir?
i'll still take a great full HD screen for now.
at 14 or 15 inch. 4k still is overkill
unless the battery can max out on the laptop which i don't think they will.
hopefully one day integrated graphics will be so good that great screens with fast refresh rate will be the norm.
We will likely see more benefits for the avg consumer over 4k"
Lenovo Thinkpad,ok la even phone also have 4k display
Lenovo Thinkpad,"honesty, hows the screen panel on the tp x395?
i remember most thinkpads like those in my office have absolute garbage screen panels."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Your office using IPS or TN panel? Upgrade to FHD and it will be IPS. If using HD only it is TN and TN is garbage
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yea but got difference ma?
maybe if use for VR than the extra pixels will help.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"True even on IGP it is still demanding.
1080p will do fine for most laptop, if need 4K just use external monitor.
Anyway for 4K smaller the screen size, amount of detail isn't very obvious.
Recommend size for 4K contents is 50"" and above."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thinkpad IPS is garbage too and TN should not be an option at all. They need to do better, screen is something you look at daily."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Why do you need a 4K laptop screen though? Even at 1440p, you will need to scale the image up by 200% to see properly, and that is if Windows can scale it correctly. 4K in my opinion is not useful on a laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You can get up to an OLED screen on ThinkPads if you think the IPS is bad. At the top end range, they will use good IPS screen. At the mid and low end, don't expect them to give you super good screens. Higher backlight, yes, but color reproduction is still going to be just average."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I guess it is a side effect of being extremely thin. But thanks for the heads up.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"4K is still uncommon on mobile phone. So far only Sony have been pushing out mobile phones with 4K screen to try and differentiate themselves. However, I don't find it a meaningful upgrade. People would like 4K screen for watching movies or playing games in higher definition. In both use cases, I won't want to use a 6 to 7 inch mobile phone if given a choice.
Also the mobile OS handles the image scaling very well. This is not the case with Windows. It works in most cases, but when it does not work with say and older application, you are left with super small image/ fonts which you cannot read due to the size."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I don't need OLED I just want a good IPS, is that not fair enough? I am always buying AMD thinkpad yearly since ryzen. If they put amd in 1 carbon or p2 wokstation I will by it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Which doesn't make sense to me. If you feel the monitor is not great, you have the option not to buy from Lenovo isn't it? Instead you buy them yearly for a product that does not suit one of your main requirement.
Having a decent screen is one of the key requirements for me as well, though I suppose my expectation is not as high as yours. As long as it is not a crappy TN or HD resolution screen, I think it is good enough for me considering that I am not paying top dollars for it. The E485 has got a pretty alright screen to me, though I am disappointed with the super dim screen. I can still accept it because I paid below 700 bucks for it, knowing very well that 700 bucks can only get me laptops with super low end specs in the Intel camp.
Anyway, I think it is likely you won't see AMD chips in high end models anytime soon. Intel made sure of that."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"so actually which ultrabook is good
or we should not go them.. just get those that are a tad bigger?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Tbh. Ultrabook usually will skimp somewhere just to make it thin and light. And usually it is the cooling department cause it is the biggest. It is also design to throttle when it hit high temps.
Usually people buy ultrabook is really for portability, the rest is just a bonus.
To me my first notebook is from compaq. And those days a 14inch lappy is minimally 2.4kg. Now even the E595 that i just bought, a 15inch is even lighter than the older ones. And i dont find 1.7kg heavy to even carry around anymore."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Saving few hundred grams to sacrifice the number of ports, money n reduced specs is definitely a no no for most
Sent from Rem Best Grill using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It depends on what you are looking out for. If it is portability, Ultrabook is an option. If not Ultrabook, then you need to ask yourself what is an acceptable weight for you. For performance, Ultrabook is certainly out of the question.
In my case, I have a laptop for work and in case I need to bring it out. For heavy load, I leave it to my desktop. I am fine with a heavier laptop, i.e. over 2kg. As long as I can use it comfortably and the battery life is decent, I am good."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually I don't think this is true. If there is no market for ultra portables, then most companies will not go through the trouble of creating and designing more Ultrabooks. Think how well Apple is selling their Macbook Air and Macbooks and you get a sense.
I do agree with you I am no fan of being dependent on dongles for connectivity."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"4k screen wise. Don't get Lenovo. Their 4k screens have a major issue with image retention.
After the circuit breaker, try this: go to a best denki etc store and on a Lenovo 4k laptop, open Microsoft Paint. Use the paint bucket to fill the background grey. You will notice the desktop wallpaper ""burnt in"" as the background. So far I saw this issue on Lenovo S940, C940 and S740 display sets.
I had the S740 previously also and had dead pixel issues. I think for Lenovo, stick with the Full HD 100% sRGB/72% NTSC screens.
4k oled also a no-no because grey uniformity is like ****...
Seems like phones these days have much higher quality screens than laptops"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Btw ThinkPads used to have garbage screens. Now the situation is better alr. Just make sure you get the IPS with 72% NTSC/100% sRGB should be safe. Think now all the T and X series should be ok.
Lenovo Thinkpad,I'm currentyly using an ultrabook. actually bought this because need to bring around. since now WFH seems like not so useful. didn't like it being hot that's all when zooming.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Basically like me. I do simple basic tasks on my new ultrabook but I still have a desktop for heavy duty things.
There is actually a very huge demand for ultrabooks especially in the businesses. For those who need a laptop to work, they usually provide ultrabooks for easy portability to those who need to bring it around.
my old ""ultrabook"" was 1.7kg.. my new one is 1.28...
the term stays the same. but its really getting lighter"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"That is true. Back when Intel created this ""Ultrabook"", most slim laptops below 2kg can fall in the category. Fast forward to recent couple of years, all the PC manufacturer is pulling an Apple, and going crazy making it light and slim. I don't mind light and slim, but the quest for ever lighter and slimmer laptop needs to stop because it is becoming counter productive when it comes to performance. If this continues, I will just have to ditch having a laptop and use an iPad instead. I don't know if the PC makers know that an Intel processor is not an ARM chip sipping power. Even the ULV series, power consumption can burst up to 25W, and the ultra slim laptop is going to be like a hot plate."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The market wants Ultrabook as thin as possible for typing word documents.
If productivity is more important, look for T or X series with TDP set to 25w."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For me I really like light and slim.... Back in 2012 when I first entered uni, I bought a 14 inch laptop which weighed a whopping 2.3kg and had poor batt life so I ended up having to bring the power brick everywhere also and becoming a slave to an AC power source. If it were today, I'll buy a 1.2kg laptop plus a USB-C power bank and everything will be under 2kg.
As for power, I think the current quad core processors are speedy enough for many tasks. Also don't forget, while we have thin and light laptops, there are still more powerful laptops available with 25w+ processors."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thats the problem. Going thinner and thinner and lighter every gen. It is something going to be not worth it anymore.
The performance really take a hit. Is not how powerful it is. Even if one put a 25w processor, it will throttle. And when it throttles the performance take a dip. Then comes to whats the point here for ultrabook? It is meant for light task and portability only. Anything more, with prolong heat of the processor is just gonna shorten the lifespan of it.
Yes it may be light, with a lot of usb ports sacrificed, one has to spend more money again on dongles and extension ports.
Another issue would be expansion of other memory modules. Most ultrabooks comes with embedded ram modules. Ram is fine, all is good. When ram is faulty good luck. That leaves you to have only 1 Ram slot left.
Sometimes i think like someone mentioned here. Ultrabook is all good in terms of weight. But really susah when looking at the compromises.
To me, i stick with traditional laptops. Cause honestly i dont mind the extra 300-400g. But i get overall better thermal performance, i get more useful ports, i get a better performing laptop that performs well enough for my photo and video apps.
If i truly want something that performs really well, a desktop is where i will go for."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Just get P series for photo video app.
Lenovo Thinkpad,where are the intel 10s reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Depends on individual needs. 1 group dun mind carrying heavy with full features ports, etc while another group prefers as light as possible.
I belong to 2nd group. I like to travel light for biz, a 13 inches laptop with weight of 1 kg and best with thunderbolt is more than enough. I need my laptop for doc, ppt, xls, emails, youtube and other basic, maybe some games installed, like starcraft.
My current 4 yrs plus hp envy serves me well but it is getting old and battery is gone. I am looking around for a light weight laptop and waiting to see what ryzen 4000s laptops around."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"ultrabooks are not what you want if u want performance for a laptop. there are high perf laptops that give 45W processors with decent cooling. Albeit heavier than an ultrabook.. different laptops have different purposes... but as mentioned, an ultrabook suits me portable needs well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Well I wouldn't say its a 'problem' but rather we have more choices these days. Like you can still opt for a heavier, more powerful laptop if need be.
In my case I am happy with my ultrabook for portable use. For heavy loads I use my desktop. My only complaint is my office's Dell Latitude is very very laggy but maybe because of my company bloatware on it lol"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If there's P1 with ryzen, that would be a buy for me"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This is the problem. Regardless of model/ series, the laptop is getting slimmer and lighter with each passing year. Even the DTR are slimmer and lighter based on my observation. As a result, many are barely able to keep the components cool, losing ports, or losing upgradeability i.e. the current T series comes with 1 soldered RAM, and only 1 to upgrade."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I agree Ultrabooks are not for performance. But noting that the components are getting more power hungry, yet the chassis for all laptops are getting slimmer, at some point performance is going to be badly capped. Chip makers have come up with creative ways to manage the heat by giving it boost capabilities if there is thermal legroom. But these are just bursty clockspeed bumps and generally don't sustain in any laptop. A quick look at all the Intel/AMD chips of recent years and you can see the trend. Renoir seems to have bucked the trend somewhat even though they have a boost speed because the shrink to 7nm certainly helps thermally and able to sustain at a fairly high clockspeed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Bloatware can't really be helped for an organization if it is for security reasons. I used to have a corporate laptop that takes a solid 10 mins to boot up because of the number of security apps that it needs to load. That laptop uses an SSD by the way, and not some mechanical hard drive. So you can imagine the number of bloatwares."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lol my wife t490 corp lappy really wols despite the ssd being used. The vpn the antivirus they used requires a lot of resources.
Lenovo Thinkpad,There may a few security/ anti-virus being installed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This is not a problem. Just because one person likes to eat Chinese food and not western food does not make him/her a problem.
You can get a gaming laptop with 45w CPU.
I definitely prefer bringing out a 1.2kg ultrabook, a USB c cable and an adapter weighting less than 200g for my work.
If you need a sustained CPU power, you need a 45w processor"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is it not enough memory?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I don't believe it is a memory issue anymore. While it only has 12GB of RAM, my old personal laptop only have 8GB and boots significantly faster. The problem is the security softwares are very resource heavy. I suspect it is actually scanning before it loads. Otherwise I don't see why it takes that long to boot into a usable state."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think you are not getting what I said. I said it is not just an Ultrabook problem. Look around you, all the laptops are losing weight and size. Sure 45W laptops are bigger in size, but still compare it with 2 years ago, they definitely lost weight. This slimming exercise is not just limited to Ultrabook. If you read any 45W laptop reviews, most of them can't sustain the supposed high clockspeed. I am not expecting it to run at full boost speed, but even at the base speed they struggle. Power they certainly have enough, but cooling, no. PC makers try to go around the problem but slapping more heatpipes, but that does not solve the problem of the small heatsink that are the bottleneck."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"so probably if one is OK with standard NB non ultras and NOT desktop replacement , it might be better to get these  since they are now like say slightly more than 1.5kg as compared to prev prev prev gen..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi guys, any laptop is worth to buy right now ? Looking for a laptop that is light and I dont have the habit of Gaming. Is Asus Zenbook 2020 a good choice at $1800?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I owned 1st gen UX 21 before. Love it and easily carried around. Good pricing and portability. No problem with it but as norm, battery failed after few yrs and good excuse to upgrade.
Currently, I am also looking at Zenbook 13 or 14 but holding back for 4000s."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This series no longer worth it
You guys promoted this too much on hwz
Market spoilers"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I would avoid the ZenBook for one simple reason -- it cannot charge through USB-C.
I would try the Acer Swift 5 instead for the price. Or if you can wait, wait for the Renoir series or the upcoming refreshed HP Envy 13 which now has a Thunderbolt port and has much smaller footprint than before."
Lenovo Thinkpad,whats going on?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Look, it is an Intel thing
When was the last time you see a laptop not throttle? You need to run on the Low power CPU like 5-10w in order for it not to throttle significantly due to huge heat created. Intel 45w TDP and AMD 45w TDP are very different, with Ryzen much cooler. You can check the desktop parts you will know.
Well, wait for Ryzen 4000 45w APU. Asus G14 is promising."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"That's because I have configured the highest priced screen but I want a better screen still, and other brands don't have thinkpad keyboard."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone getting Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5 with Ryzen 7 4700U? There's a flash deal that just started on Lazada for 1 day only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,ME! been eyeing!@@@
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I don't think there is official Lenovo warranty though. But it's a good price.
Can someone buy and test whether 4k@60hz over DP works? Lol"
Lenovo Thinkpad,this one right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yeah ! Indeed it's very tempting 🤣
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yup! Indeed tempting offer.
Lenovo Thinkpad,it is worth because base model 4500u and 1 year warranty is 1.4k
Lenovo Thinkpad,Base model is out in Singapore?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Its a good deal to me. I suspect it will cost more if you configure it over at Lenovo's site. I bought my Lenovo IdeaPad 5 from this seller just few weeks back as well after doing the same config on Lenovo's site.
Lenovo Thinkpad,nope. compare with australia
Lenovo Thinkpad,"In addtion, the below points makes it even more enticing.
1, Ready stock, Ship out by today, express delivery 1~2 dayslatest by 14 May.
2, Lenovo Brand Fair 4-31 May 2020，5 series and above Free MS Office 2019 permanent license
I do want to caution that the RAM in this case is likely soldered. So there may be no option to upgrade, in case you are thinking of getting more RAM."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think because there is no sale now, Lenovo jacked up the prices of all their products significantly. Recently went to check the E495, and the base spec is already over 1.1K SGD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I get the point about the ThinkPad keyboard. At least in terms of priority, I will certainly take a better screen if I can find it elsewhere, and settle for a lesser keyboard. I type quite a lot as well, but I can adapt. Because I use the screen all the time when using a laptop, I think it will be my priority."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Pulled the trigger and gotten it.
Actually i'm more gian about the express delivery than the microsoft office

Will post more update once it arrives"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Very tempting to get the Lenovo as well but quite surprised they still using the barrel plug
saw that it can charge over the USB C as well but anyone know how many watts it'll take? I have 65W and Apple 87W charger."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"But is it safe to purchase from themInfinito ATRiX ?
Did a google on the brand and came across several complaints about Atrix Dynamics.. do they belong to the same company such that they simply changed name ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just pulled the trigger, can't wait to receive and test it out."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If i'm taking my previous laptop Asus Zephyrus GU502 USB-C PD Specs, You will be able to use Apple 87W USB C Charger, however max wattage pull would only be 65W."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"don't pofma me..
is this lenovo occifer stock?
this lcd isit good?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hi dear~confirm 100% sRGB and 3Years Lenovo onsite warranty
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If 100% sRGB it's quite a good buy. Only two points worth noting:
- output possibly restricted to 4K@30HZ going by psref
- restricted to usb 3.0 gen 1. I have a gen 2 SSD which might be bottlenecked by this.
But ok for the price it's a really good deal, company name notwithstanding.
I might wait for the T14 AMD instead. That one will have 2 usb c gen2 ports with displayport 1.4 and hdmi 2.0..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ask the staff inside lo, if the specs are true will be quite worth
Sent from Rem Is Best Waifu using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think it's Lenovo official stock. I checked the model number to the psref, it's a Singapore model. For some reason the psref was removed but Google cache still has a copy of it. Unfortunately it's impossible to check whether really 100% srgb"
Lenovo Thinkpad,The AU website listed HDMI 1.4 and color gamut 45%i assume this is NTSC for this model. Is the lazada using a different panel?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you look at the psref website there is a version with 100% sRGB. short of using a colorimeter on the actual unit it's impossible to verify since both are full HD IPS 300 nits lol.
Hdmi 1.4 will mean only 4k@30hz really a pity because all Ryzen igpus support hdmi 2.0. But I'm more curious whether the limitation also applies over displayport."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I saw them listed as an authorised reseller on Lenovo's FB:
So... seems ok?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Very interesting indeed. After looking at all the amd skus for both 15w and high powered 35-45w sku. Intel need to really buck up liao lol.
Even the upcoming r5 is a hexa core. Really wonder how the i5 i7 quad cores gonna sell lol"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Looking at the Intel counterpart, it has the option for 100% sRGB so it might be true?
14"" FHD 1920 x 1080 IPS, 300 nits, sRGB 100% Metal SKUs only
14"" FHD 1920 x 1080 IPS, 300 nits, 45% NTSC
14"" FHD 1920 x 1080 TN, 250 nits, 45% NTSC
14"" HD 1366 x 768 TN, 220 nits, 45% NTSC"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I just checked with someone who has the 15 inch model. The USB-C port supports 4k@60hz@10-bit so I assume it should be a normal DP 1.4 pass through which is good news! Hopefully the 14 inch is the same.
I just ordered. Apparently there's an additional 50 off if you follow the shop. Tbh I think atrix doesn't have the best of reputation, but let's see how it goes. I'll test to see whether 100% sRGB claim is true.
Probably will sell once the T14 AMD comes out but I guess it should retain its value well?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yes but metal SKU only. The AMD SKU they are selling is the aluminium + plastic SKU but then the screen selection across different SKUs may be different.
Lenovo Thinkpad,U able to use the $50 off ? the shop told me not applicable to the purchase
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Didn't know about the additional 50 off, oh well, still a good deal, please update us whether its really 100% sRGB. I also ordered one but got no device to test the screen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For my case I wasn't able to apply that $50 by following the shop.
Let's wait for the laptop to be shipped out"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can leh, it applied for me automatically on checkout.
Hope this laptop retains its resale value for 1 mth or so before T14 AMD is released or the Envy x360 AMD... Haha"
Lenovo Thinkpad,well.. no choice.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Got a lousy screen but good for general work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Guys better read more reviews first, I have read 2 reviews already, they said sRGB is only 40 plus only just like the Acer Ryzen 4000"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"HDMI version 1.4 can support 4K@60

2 x USB 3.1 Gen 1 1 x always-on
1 x USB 3.1 Type-C Gen 1 DP + power delivery
1 x HDMI 1.4b
1 x SD card reader
1 x combo audio/mic jack"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The 40 plus is based on NTSC, so sRGB should be around 50-60s. Then again, the T series from yesteryear and the E series that everyone is raving about here also comes with this lousy screen.
Based on the
for this model, there is an SKU with 100% sRGB, so there is a slim chance that they are right. But I don't think resale value will be affected much based on this fact ba... Everytime those stupid Carousellers try to lowball because it's an ""i5"" and not i7... don't think they care about display as long as WOW OCTA CORE 16GB RAM"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"4k@60Hz only at 4:2:0 which is chroma subsampling. Which means the colour resolution will be halved.
Why are we still on HDMI 1.4, you ask? Because prior to Ice Lake, the iGPUs on Intel processors support only up to HDMI 1.4 or DisplayPort 1.2. But the thing is Ryzen iGPUs support HDMI 2.0 all along you can compare the spec of T490 vs T495 for example, but Lenovo for some reason is choosing to cut costs here."
Lenovo Thinkpad,do help to review the laptop once you've received.
Lenovo Thinkpad,yes so many reviews I read point to subpar screen.
Lenovo Thinkpad,wha... local.. than why lenovo sg don't have yet
Lenovo Thinkpad,want to clear unsold 3500u chips
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Where do you guys find the review ah?
But their naming of their laptops quite funny, Ideapad slim 5, some show 15.6"" some show 14"". Some total remove the word slim from the branding
But price : performance ratio cannot hiam"
Lenovo Thinkpad,give promotion.. under 800 sure all sapu!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"by the way romania seems to have the S540-13ARE but I cannot find this laptop anywhere else on the internet lol:
Specs seem pretty good. QHD + 100% sRGB and in 13 inch form factor. Dual USB-C Gen 2 and has IR sensor.
Btw just realised the IdeaPad 5 which Atrix is selling has no fingerprint sensor"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The monitor that came with my IdeaPad 5 14IIL is from BOE. Can't measure the color accuracy since I don't have the necessary tools.
Update: The specs mentioned 100% sRGB for this BOE monitor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"DId they confirm? The reason why I am asking is because they said the same about the IdeaPad 5 that I purchased from them 2 weeks ago. But when the product came, there's fingerprint sensor on the power switch that works. I even wrote that in my review.
Do ask them to reconfirm because it is not written on the specs found on the box. So they may not be 100% sure."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I think it does have the fingerprint sensor as standard.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"IdeaPad 5 have 2 sizes, which is normally mentioned in the name. Not too sure what the slim means when the seller mentioned the weight being around 1.5KG. The model that I have running an Intel processor is also IdeaPad 5, and also 1.5KG."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Did you check the minimal purchase amount? I recall it was 50 off 1600. If so, then that is the reason why it did not apply. If you collected the Atrix couple during the weekend sale, you should have 20 bucks off."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Because in the US they have this model called Ideapad Slim 7, so i assume there will be similar model with ""5"" in it
But it looks more premium as compared to ideapad 5 AMD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I went to Google the SKU configuration 81YM005DSB it got removed from Lenovo's website from Google still has a cache:
Shows here no fingerprint reader.
Btw, yours is which IdeaPad 5 model? What is the model of the BOE display?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The $50 is applicable, I have to unfollow and follow again on the Lazada app from my phone for the coupon to pop up on the screen to claim. Then when check out it will auto apply the coupon."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually now you talk about it, i realize mine got deducted the $50 right before i paid.
My mistake, saw wrongly"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The model number says IdeaPad 5 14IIL05. Model number I think is 81YH007BSB.
As for the model of the display, I only checked the device manager hardware ID, which returned the value, BOE08D7. I tried looking up for this, but found no information on it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You can't compare the 5 and the 7 series since they are different class. Generally, the IdeaPad should start with 3 as the lower end model and 7 being the top end model. They added another S145 which I think is lower end than the 3 series."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you can, can you download HWINFO which should show the full model name of the display?
Btw noted yours have a beefier 57wh battery as well the one atrix is selling is 45wh only. How is the battery life on the Intel model?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"In Singapore its called the Yoga Slim 7. I was waiting for it to be launched actually. The Intel version was on the Lenovo store for a few weeks but mysteriously disappeared. I heard the Intel version got recalled for some issue or something. You cant find any review anywhere. Lol.
The Slim 7 is not very light too... Around 1.5kg. I really miss the older IdeaPad 720s and s730 which were very portable and lightweight.
Assuming the Ideapad 5 really has a 100% sRGB screen the only difference would be build materials, usb 3.1 Gen2/tb3 and hdmi2.0.
Honestly I more curious waiting to see how much the T14 AMD will cost. If the t495 is any indication, should be around 2k for a high end config with 16gb and 1tb ssd. Still cheaper than dell XPS or macbook"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Well if it doesnt have the 100% sRGB screen like the seller mentioned, I think can return the product since they gave wrong information."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ahhh i see, but so far hows the build quality at least for your Ideapad 5 ? For the base which uses ABS, does it feel flimsy / warp easily with just alittle force.
First time getting Lenovo laptop, so not too sure about its build quality for their lower end models. Much appreciated !
Hahahah actually everyone is fine with this model, but the million dollar question is still about the 100% sRGB screen !
The performance definitely on par / wins the dell XPS 13."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Build quality is decent. In fact it is a step up from my ThinkPad E485 which is really the entry level ThinkPad model. The base is plastic, but feels sturdy. The keyboard feels very nice to type on. No complain on the build.
My main complain is on the Samsung SSD PM991 being used on this laptop because it is the smaller 2242 form factor used, it runs really really hot. In games and for about 10 mins, it hit 74 degs. When running an anti virus scan, it heats up to 81 degs and throttled to keep the SSD running at 75 to 76 degs. In comparison, the WD Black that I was using in my E485 that I upgraded ran mostly at 60ish degs. The SSD on the IdeaPad has got a warranty sticker on it, so I am thinking if I can change it without voiding warranty. Not sure if anyone knows? I know for Acer, you can break the warranty seal, and as long as you don't damage anything, warranty will still be valid."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think you need to be careful here. I've ever got my return rejected by seller despite the fact that they confirmed a feature that was not found in the product. And its a local LazMall seller, and not some unknown Chinese seller.
The moment you opened the item, the odds of return is greatly diminished. In this case, it can be quite difficult to ascertain if it is a 100% sRGB screen without trained eyes or proper equipments. Lenovo multi source their display, so unless otherwise specified, there is always a chance you get the poorer quality screen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Maybe the Yoga bend too much that it broke.
Anyway, I suspect the cost of ThinkPad T series with AMD will not be as cheap as it was before. Previously regardless of Ryzen 5 or 7, you get standard 4 cores. Now with a higher core count with the higher end models, the laptop cost is likely to increase. Which is why I feel this IdeaPad 5 is pretty decently priced."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think it also depends how AMD prices it. I see overseas pricing for Envy x360, Swift 3 and IdeaPad 5, price difference is only about 100 USD.
Not sure if it's wise for me to buy this just to play around... Maybe I should cancel my order
Btw whoever wants to calibrate their display... I can probably lend my calibrator to you for a nominal fee. After CB of course."
Lenovo Thinkpad,not lazmall cannot return
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I see, thanks for the info, fingers crossed if its really a 100% sRGB screen like they mentioned but if its not, I might just sell it after a few months of usage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Don't rush to buy bah, wait for the thinkpad versions to come out than see."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Btw someone on Carousell is doing preorder for Acer Swift 3 China sets. 4700U 16gb 1tb SSD for 1,300.
Swift 3 no need to guess, it's **** display. But has usb 3 gen 2 and hdmi 2.0"
Lenovo Thinkpad,1.3K for China set is not worth it I feel. The display is not good even though its an IPS screen. I think Anandtech and Tomshardware have already reviewed it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Well... I was camping for this particular model, waiting for the flash sales price to release.. and the moment the clock strike 12 am, I am super delighted to see the price is marked down to 1298!
However when I tried to collect the $50 follower voucher by following the store. there is no pop-up window to collect the $50 voucher. I even PM the shop at that point in time. only to receive a reply at 12 pm stating that this $50 dollars voucher doesn't apply to this flash sales price Which we all know is not true.
So after placing the order without using the voucher, I randomly went to try to unfollow and follow the shop and the pop-up window appear for me to collect the $50 voucher!
so I cancelled the order and re-ordered with the voucher
But I am praying hard  and hope that the seller doesn't do anything to my sealed laptop"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"u missed the previous promo actually...
I bought
3500u
512 ssd
16gb ram
1080p 300 nits monitor
total 1.3k nia"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Which model is this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"didn't miss.. i got a similar config also, was even cheaper
what model was yrs?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,thinkpad x395
Lenovo Thinkpad,I have the Slim 5 sitting in the Lazada cart now while I mull over whether to get it ^^
Lenovo Thinkpad,i see... my was a t495
Lenovo Thinkpad,"if I were you , I'd wait for ppl who bot it and see their review"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Just wait for the lenovo sg to come out with customize option
Lenovo Thinkpad,I wanted the light weight.. If not I also will go T series lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I mean if you need it, then I see no reason to hold back. I actually feel for the specs, extended onsite warranty and free gifts, its a really good deal."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"T495 panel with 400 nits has got a high 98.6% sRGB. Refer to the
."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yup. But few gens back the t series also had crappy screens
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Good to know. Similar to my observations, I feel the IdeaPad 5 build is quite good for its price. As to the performance of the 4700U, the ability to maintain a higher clockspeed is as expected. Good for those looking for high CPU performance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all, I made the purchase! Excited as the Lenovo laptop will be my first laptop"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Have fun man. If I did not buy my laptop 2 weeks back, I would have gotten this. Got tired waiting for Renoir based laptops. May consider getting a desktop Renoir instead for my HTPC if the pricing is attractive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Haha just came to the realisation that my Renoir laotop may potentially be faster than my desktop??? Bought i5-6600k a few years back, just before AMD struck back"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It just goes to show how much improvements AMD brought to the PC space. While Intel was happily selling us expensive 2 and 4 core chips for more than a decade, AMD came in about 3 years back and PC became exciting again. Even hardcore Intel fans should thank AMD for more affordable and powerful Intel chips. Competition is good."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No leh, I hate AMD, now need to upgrade more often
Thought my desktop can last 8 years last time hahahahahah"
Lenovo Thinkpad,By the way anyone orders shipped out alr? Mine still packing stage...
Lenovo Thinkpad,time to upgrade desktop also.......
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya same still packing... chatted with them, they said will start to ship today and expect 3-5 days to receive.. thought their listing said 1-2 days"
Lenovo Thinkpad,You still have the choice not to upgrade man.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Eh, I thought it said same day delivery or did I remember wrongly? For this model, I know they also have a caveat that buyer could receive on 18th May or something like that."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No same day delivery, only 'express delivery' within 1 - 2 days and latest and receive by 14 May."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yeah but I think that faq was posted when the listing appeared last week lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,My status has changed to 'Your package has been packed and is ready to be shipped to you'. So we'll see.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Means you need to wait for NinjaVan to pick up and deliver.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Best case scenario it comes either tomorrow or Friday, won't be surprise if it comes on Saturday."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"that's why for the past 10 years, there was no such thing as ""CPU bottleneck"" coz intel never improved. now AMD came and intel needs to wake up or die... and they are rushing 10nm coz they were too slow on 14nm.
also, I don't need to keep changing motherboards when I  change processor for AMD. I need to for intel"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ordered 3 weeks back.. Still have not shipped... Sigh...
Lenovo Thinkpad,"okay la, T series not bad quite lightweight also"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"great.
waiting for thinkpad! can't come sooner!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Okay just checked with the seller... ETA tomorrow
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Asked the CSO of lenovo.
Tentatively is 2nd week of June for the new T series
so i guess inline with the launch in NA?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,That's great! But then need to wait another month for it to reach sg after ordering?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My guess is they already building up inventory, so the time after ordering should not be too long, hard to say with the covid19 now though
i see some of the drivers got support for the new thinkpads since April"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think it is possible if demand is high. As per my questio to Atrix computer about the 15 inch IdeaPad 5, they responded to say due to shortage of Renoir chips, 15 inch model will only be out in July. If that is true, and based on observations on the availability of Renoir laptops 1.5 months after AMD officially announced and released in March, I think there is indeed a shortage. I think to some extend the supply disruption will also affect the PC makers in releasing new laptops as well."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I just receive a GrabExpress delivery notification coming from a shop in Sim Lim Square, it seems like my laptop is coming soon? Will update."
Lenovo Thinkpad,whoa whoa! do review and give some photos!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lucky you... Mine is ninjavan, surely very slow"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wah I also received grabexpress delivery notification omg
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Seems like they are mass sending out the laptops, just received a notification as well !"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just receive an image on GrabExpress of my item, seems like they just put it in a plastic bag without even wrapping it :s22 My ETA is 25 mins but definitely will be more than that."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Driver is 4 mins away wow.
Hopefully can play with it tonight and test sRGB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Looking forward to your test, according to the picture i receive, the sticker specs on the box doesn't say anything about 100% sRGB, so I'm still a skeptic on this. My ETA has changed to 35 mins, oh wells.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Seems like they changed the delivery partner to Grab. Good. NinjaVan offers same days delivery too. I ordered my laptop from Atrix at 2.45pm and got it around 4+ on the same day.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just received mine laptop!!
the delivery uncle told me the seller paid delivery fee - $18 + $4 parking fee.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Huh? Need pay the delivery fee meh?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Huh why do you need to pay ? Mine was via GrabExpress never request me to pay
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Paiseh, I mean the seller paid $22 just for sending the stuff to us!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Enjoy guys, mine still far out, think i'll receive by 8PM?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,review review
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Don't know where am i really getting my lappy.
Ordered my T495S in late April, ETA 4 weeks so should be late May receive.
Last week, received an email saying will have a slight delay, change to ship out in late May, receive on 4th June.
Just now received another email saying that it will be shipped out next week."
Lenovo Thinkpad,pls help review throttling
Lenovo Thinkpad,Does anyone think its worth to buy x1 carbon gen 7?
Lenovo Thinkpad,what laptop u all buy sia?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Total damage: $1248 after Using $50 voucher on the $1298 flash sales
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Did you all receive a wireless mouse? I got the laptop bag, wondering if there's supposed to be a mouse too?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"First impression, display seems dim and washed out. Most probably not 100% sRGB but will do a test just to be sure."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I didnt. Dont think there will be either
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Other first impressions - adapter doesn't have ground pin so if you touch the aluminium lid you can feel ""current"" running through.
No fingerprint reader.
The plastic base has the rough coating, think similar to the E485 I had briefly last time.
Laptop is thicc and heavy compared to my XPS 13"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just received mine, I'm not using the barrel plug they gave, instead I'm charging with a Ugreen 65w USB-C charger. No issues. Quite dissapointed ours doesn't have the fingerprint sensor. Display does look abit dull to my eyes."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Display wise with just naked eyes, already don't seems to be 100% sRGB and it's Abit washout. But definitely better than some laptop I own before.
I recommend anyone who owns this laptop, just grab a uGreen USB C charger 65W. Cost around 20+ and easily available on Lazada !
Build quality better than expected, of course if you compare with high end laptops the difference is skyhigh. But the performance is able to compensate the cons 😁😁"
Lenovo Thinkpad,By the way I have just checked the warranty online.. it stated 2 years warranty instead of 3.. seller told me present invoice will do 😅
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just completed the calibration:
57.9% sRGB, 40.1% Adobe RGB and 41.2% DCI-P3. Quite a stark difference since I'm used to 100% sRGB screens; my main monitor has 95% DCI-P3 lol.
The anti-glare coating on the screen also seems a bit extreme
Not sure if I should do a refund. Currently I am awaiting refund of my XPS 13. If approved, then it means I might be without laptop for the next two months before T14 AMD is released lol."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wah I hate this ""Present Invoice"" reasoning, by then my invoice would have already been disintegrate Or I totally forget about it 🤣"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Its not on the power button? The rough coating around the keyboard is deliberate and feels quite nice to me.
Cant compare the 3 devices man. One cost significantly more than the other."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Just take a picture or scan the receipt and store it somewhere. I normally save them on my cloud drive after naming it in a way you can easily identify.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yep using the 65W Ugreen charger. I agree the screen although not 100% sRGB, its better then my previous E490 and other laptops beside my Macbook Pro but its decent enough for me, think I can live with it.
Besides that the build quality is decent. For the price I paid, I have no major major complains.
Yeah notice that too..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,What is the display model?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Refund through Lazada ? Maybe you can try luck, but quite disappointed when they mention it's 100% sRGB but turns out it's 1/2 of it 🤣, but so far performance wise I'm really happy about it. Video rendering speed is better than what I expected for the cost : performance ratio"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"quite expected one la, the specs is damn good for its price liao. got test the ssd speed?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think those who really want the 100% sRGB screens need to look for the Intel counterpart or wait for the ThinkPad series. Overall happy with the purchase, luckily paid only 1298 instead of the now 1498.
Anyone planning to upgrade storage to 1TB?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"congrats bro...
how to test the nits?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Congrats bro!
YouHeypiCanLiao"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Quick test on CrystalDiskMark: 2300MB/s read but about 1300MB/s write.
SD card reader is only UHS-1, so speed up to 80MB/s only my card should be able to read around 250MB/s.
USB-C port only up to Gen 1 speed as expected.
DisplayPort over USB-C can output 4k@60Hz. But it seems like a DisplayPort 1.2 port only, no DP 1.4 even though the GPU supports it. Means to say, max you can connect one 4K display @ 60Hz.
I will probably keep the laptop. It's fine for normal use I guess haha. Lightroom editing all those... I think mai hiam buay pai la."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I am going to use this on the go as my Lightroom and Premiere Pro machine, I'm not a professional so I don't really mind, as long as I happy with my edits I'm fine."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Atrix offered to refund no questions asked after I mentioned that it's not 100% sRGB and they say can come and collect tomorrow. they claimed Lenovo gave them the wrong specs.
A bit undecided. Maybe I need to play around more with the laptop first haha.
But I must say, given their ""reputation"" in the past I am pleasantly surprised at their good aftersales support."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hmmm... interesting...
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Heng ah. I tot really 100% sRGB. Almost pull the trigger.
I think i will just wait for the asus zephyrus 14/15 to be readily available then buy. Or perhaps if i choose not to game then i will wait for thinkpad to arrive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"can test when the throttling will kick in?
i.e you zoom + surf net + youtube.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"On the bright side, my recent laptops with 100%+ sRGB had issues with colour tints, dead pixels, backlight bleeding, etc. No such issue on this laptop as far as I can tell so far.
Installed BatteryBar and discharge rate is only 5,221mW while writing this post. Estimated battery life is 7 hours despite the small 47Wh battery.
I remember the last time I bought AMD E485 when this thread first started, lol, I could barely get 3 hours because of high idle drain I remember it was usually around 13,000mW. Now AMD laptops seem to have little compromise.
Weighed this laptop on the Xiaomi weighing scale. Weighs 1.4kg exactly vs 1.15 kg for my Dell XPS.
Display panel is AUO B140HAN04.E. Panel details here:
Using the display makes me feel a little bit... red colour blind haha. The red colours are really muted.
HWInfo shows memory is running in dual channel mode.
Going to run some benchmarks. 3DMark... what else should I run?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"By the way, I realise when I plug in my 3.5mm IEMs into the laptop, while the mic and speaker works, I cannot use the play/pause buttons or the volume up/down. Can anyone who has the laptop test this?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Have to see the ear piece build in feature whether it supports anot. Some earpiece supports iOS only or Android Only or Multiple devices. So you can check your earpiece whether it supports PC .
Lenovo Thinkpad,"thanks for the information!
looks like have to wait for the thinkpads to get a good screen"
Lenovo Thinkpad,The earpiece works with my XPS though. Wondering if it's a proprietary feature. Maybe Lenovo doesn't support it
Lenovo Thinkpad,"These are fairly light load, so I am not expecting it to throttle since it may not even be running at an all core boost."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Use an external monitor for those who need good sRGB.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually since they did not specify on the spec sheet, I was a doubtful as well. When I got the Intel version of the IdeaPad 5, it did mention that its 300 nits 100% sRGB. However there's backlight bleeding with this BOE panel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"if you download HWINFO you should be able to see a more detailed model number. From there can look at the specs.
Oh which part said it's 100% sRGB? that's interesting to know"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I talked to the CS about returning the item and getting the Intel version instead as in the Intel Ideadpad 5 listing they clearly put it 100% sRGB monitor but the CS replied saying their Intel version not using the 100% sRGB screen. So whack
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just ran some benchmarks. Performance is good.
Cinebench R20 2891 max, 2423 min after 5 runs. I guess there is some thermal throttling but nothing too severe.
3dmark sky diver score - 12000 on physics test"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Which listing you saw ah?
Lenovo Thinkpad,I checked yesterday on HWInfo. It only mentioned unknown monitor with the model BOE08D7. sRGB is mentioned on the Atrix Lazadas page.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you still keep the box, does it show 100% sRGB at the spec at the side?
HWINFO there should be two ""Monitor name"" fields. There is nothing shown on the second field? Usually there should be another model number shown there one. Can you screenshot?
Also, which model did you get? I5-1035g1 with 1tb?
Do you feel the colours on the laptop is vibrant? Or muted?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Are you returning yours?
Lenovo Thinkpad,We cannot expect 100% sRGB with such prices. They should have done a higher price version with better display.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"When you expand the monitor settings, do you see something like this highlighted on the right?
E.g. mine also shows Unknown monitor AUO408D but when you expand you can see the model is actually B140HAN04.E
If it turns out to be 100% sRGB I think I'm gonna return it and change it for the Intel version... haha."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This is the model,
BOE CQ NV140FHM-N4V
I can't find information specific to this ending with N4V. Some of the 14 inch monitors ending with N4 are 250, and some 300 nits. Nothing mentioned about the colors though. It does say that it is an 8bit panel.
The model I got is what you mentioned but with the 512GB storage option.
Color wise, I think it is better than the IPS on my E485."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Nothing mentioned on monitor quality on the label. It only says 14 FHD IPS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The IdeaPad 5 with Intel processor comes with a 100% sRGB monitor as per the spec sheet that Atrix provided. I have no way to validate it though. It cost the same as the IdeaPad 5 that comes with the Renoir chip.
I actually don't think it is impossible, rather they purposely gimp the AMD version as usual."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I managed to dig out this website in Korean:
If you translate it and see the comments, he is using the BOE CQ NV140FHM-N4V as well.
65% sRGB -- so slightly better than the 58% we have here, but far from 100% sRGB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,So I think it is a Lenovo issue since this is quite off specs. Not sure if any calibration can make this better though. I am sure these panels are not calibrated.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyway, I think previous Lenovo laptop seem to also use BOE panel."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Nah, I'll be keeping mine, so far everything is good albeit the screen but I can live with it since I've seen worse."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Probably their marketing team dunno the specs and anyhow. After all, both are IPS 300 nits panels.
I can't seem to make the reds redder on my unit. On the bright side literally, the display is actually quite bright measured 360 nits so at full brightness it looks quite ok still."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You tried upping the saturation abit in the AMD software? Not the perfect solution but abit better. Those that have colorimeter, tried calibrating the display?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Calibration won't help much on small gamut displays and may make things worst actually.
Actually I'm not sure the issue is due to contrast or colour gamut?
Anyway I will keep the laptop ba since the Intel version is also not 100% srgb"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually after all these measurements to show that these are not sRGB, I am starting to doubt if the supposed 100% sRGB monitor options on Lenovo's site are accurate. Most people won't measure the display since these requires some special equipments."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Waiting for next month see how's the price for t n e series first
Sent from Rem Best Grill using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Should be accurate if it is specifically stated as such and no other similar config. Example is the Yoga Slim 7 which only has 100% sRGB options. Here it is silent but someone dunno is it Lenovo or the retailer went to act smart and assume it's the full sRGB one.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Actually after i adjust abit of the saturation via the AMD radeon settings, the color seems to be richer and same as my current monitor. I know its a cheat way, but at least visually it looks nice"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I think will be good to have someone to test it out. Lol. I have very little confidence with them now.
Lenovo Thinkpad,So far their 7 and 9 series all use higher end screens ba. Should be ok lol.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Btw anyone managed to activate the free office?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If I am not mistaken, there should be a Lenovo seal on the screw holding the SSD down. Till now, I am not certain if it is fine to remove it without voiding warranty. It is meant to prevent tampering, but question is if this is to prevent end users like us or the sellers from tampering."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Is it? Last when I upgraded my E490, there was no such seal. I can't open the back yet as I don't have the right screws for it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,these days opening rear panel is quite normal and common..
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Well theres a lenovo seal on the default 512 NVMe. But i didnt expect to have another slot, so gonna slot it another stick of 1TB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Eh where you see the other slot?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Awesome find! Will save me the hassle when moving OS.
Lenovo Thinkpad,I didn't have any lenovo seal on the SSD screw on my E495.
Lenovo Thinkpad,The slot that my EVO 970 is in !
Lenovo Thinkpad,"nice sia, can put 2 mvme ssd inside"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"After slotting in this 1TB. This could actually be an actual workstation capable laptop. Less the screen. I would say, this laptop is one of my greater buys"
Lenovo Thinkpad,wa.. 2 slots nice.. I think my x395 only got 1 lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Oh ya forgot to mention, you guys have to self source your own screws to secure the NVMe. Just nice i have an external enclosure, so i just used it to secure in the slot as the mounting hall is standard for all NVMe Regardless its internal or external"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Out of curiosity, I went to look up the FRUs available for LCD:
FRU BO NV140FHM-N66 V8.0 FHDI AG and its two substitutes seem like the 72% NTSC models. The process for replacing the screen seems quite tedious though, but a quick search on the internet shows that screen is available for purchase for like US$60.
Very tempted to purchase and see if like PC Dreams or someone could help me to replace the screen"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Btw, which screwdriver to remove the casing? Any Torx T5 will do?
This thread should be renamed to AMD Ryzen Laptops Thread haha."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yup ! thats what i used, Torx screw should be pretty standard. Used it to dismantle macbook as well"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Actually i'm more interested in getting a bigger battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Looking at the screen area, looks hard to remove the display, I used to replace my X250 screen from a 1366x768 screen to a FHD IPS, it was an easy swap. Not sure about this though."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Whoever wants to dismantle this model Should be similar to intel :
Lenovo Thinkpad,"ya Sia. I thought can just replace the whole panel. But need to remove the bezels and all wth...
Ooo replacing battery sounds like a good idea!! But where to source for the original 57wh batt ah?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Nice find, very useful.
The X250 LCD replacement also need to remove the bezel but it was very easy since you can just 'pop' them off and no need remove the whole top.
EDIT: Just saw the video, the LCD is also hold on by tape, even more tedious."
Lenovo Thinkpad,battery might have bios whitelist so third party cannot charge
Lenovo Thinkpad,ATRiX removed the 100% SRGB spec from the Lazada page.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Where can we buy the screws if any of us plan to upgrade the storage ? Haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Maybe your motherboard has it if you have a mobo that supports NVME storage?
Lenovo Thinkpad,bro you really hardcore
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I see. For the Intel version, the CPU is sitting where the M2 slot is. So I only have a single slot. Also did you folks find the stock SSD very hot? It is a Samsung PM991 512GB. Perform a virus scan and it hits 81 degs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Sian seems like my Dell XPS refund might not happen...
Anyone interested to take the IdeaPad 5 off me?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I thought you've used the XPS for awhile right? Why are you getting it refunded?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Had some issues with the screen, long bootup times 45 seconds, microSD getting stuck in the slot, etc... I got it for less than 2 mths actually. Now they offering whole unit replacement instead."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Today I started performing some cooling enhancements and swapping out my SSD. Now in the process of cloning it, and man, that stock Samsung drive is blazing hot. I applied a copper heat spread on it, and when I touched it, I scalded my finger. I can't keep my finger there for a fraction of a second."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wow, premium price command premium service. Whole unit replacement I've not experienced it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,sell the xps as BNIB lor.. later change again got problem
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hmmm yeah I think change already might not solve the issue. Could be a route I will try to go haha
Just that non macs very hard to sell"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Interestingly just did a Cinebench test and got 2859 very close to my desktop 1700 at 2975 running at base clock with no OC
Lenovo Thinkpad,Does this support usb c charging?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yes it does! Minimum 30w required I think.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Change fan profile to extreme performance and power settings to max performance. Should be able to get 3.1k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yes it does for the Lenovo IdeaPad 5
Lenovo Thinkpad,"By the way, I have uploaded my calibrated display profile here:
This is based on the B140HAN04.E display. Think out of the box, the uncalibrated display profile is too blue-ish.
Don't expect wonders though. It's just to make the colours accurate, but will not magically change the display."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I got an offer for the laptop and am sadly parting with my one and only octa core processor. Will have to live with my slower quad core laptop for the next few years. But for daily use I think not much difference ba. Haha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,The supplied charger is not a type c cable right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,The supplied charger is not type C.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I had a T495s and when I bought it I didn't ""upgrade"" the stock 1920x1080 250nits LCD and now I felt that it is too dark. Possible to upgrade to a 300nits or 400nits LCD? Wondering how much does it cost from Lenovo?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It should be possible. Search lenovo's website for the list of FRUs available. As long as the replacement is within one of the FRUs because Lenovo has a whitelist in BIOS, it should be fine."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i found the lenovo part number and it is available for T495s. If i buy online from overseas abt US$140+++, anyplace how to change? My warranty will be gone ar? I still hv 2 yrs plus... possible to buy and ask Lenovo to change for me?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"can try those pc repair shops at SIM lim or pc dreams I guess... But yeah maybe can try Lenovo.
I guess if the replacement is done properly nobody might ever find out it was ever changed lol"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Normally how much those shop will charge to change the panel?
Lenovo Thinkpad,anyone actually tried the WWAN feature? I didn't get but wondering if I missed anything lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,"About $100 I think.
WWAN is basically you can put in a SIM card. Useful if you work often on the go and have no Wi-Fi I guess...
By the way, this Chinese website has quite a comprehensive review of the Slim 7:
Cinebench R20 multi-score is 3.8k lolol"
Lenovo Thinkpad,lcd panel replacement is easy to diy even with no experience. Watch youtube video.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"wow didnt know that Lenovo has a full removal and replacement maintenance manual and video... It looks easy except not too sure if they will put too much glue or tape for the bezel to be removed...
Here is the link for those who wants to DIY."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks for your calibration but when I tried it, its too warm for my liking, anyway good work!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,performance is really good for integrated
Lenovo Thinkpad,It sure is... Too bad I'm now stuck on ice lake gen11 graphics and toasty temperature haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Legion 5 4600H/4800H and Ideapad Flex 5 4500U/4700U now on Lenovo SG. 6-8 weeks and 2 weeks to ship.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I also came across this interesting 2nd gen offering:
QHD 16:10 screen in an IdeaPad 5 series and 35w CPU. Too bad only one config available"
Lenovo Thinkpad,just need 16gb ram and its good to go
Lenovo Thinkpad,nice find! spec out the legion 5 cost around 2k.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Why only gtx 1650? Thought have rtx option?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Flex 5 looks decent also..
man still waiting for those thinkpads"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Think that is 5i version
should be intel only"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The features in 5 say up to rtx though. Although not surprising if only 5i, typical intel bribing oem."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"IdeaPad and legion durable? Several years I bought one consumer graded Lenovo, it will always fail near warranty end period. Initially the motherboard died just before 2 yrs heng few days before 2 yrs mark and got the board replaced. But just after 2 yrs of changing motherboard, it died again...
Whereas Thinkpad that I used before can last for a long time and got one lasted more than 8 yrs and still functioning."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyone know the brightness level of this model?
Need at least 300 nits"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Bought a Flex 5 yesterday and got a good discount from the CSO always speak to them, got 2x powerbanks previously for not buying anything and just being nice lol
Fingers crossed for the 2 weeks delivery!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"after customizing, its around 1.6k not a bad price"
Lenovo Thinkpad,intel is sinking fast
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not bad for the price, seems like it comes with stylus support as well?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yea, I'm looking for 2 in 1s mainly due to my work nature
Been deliberating for on the new HP Envys x360 13, Asus Flips and Lenovo series. Did all research possible, and decided to pull the trigger on Flex due to price point under 1k cause of discount.
Still a bit gutted that HP delayed the AMD release of HP Envys due to Covid cause the design blows the rest of the 2 in 1s out of the water. But for 300 dollars lesser, the Flex is a very very viable alternative."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Good price. Too bad I got my laptop recently, otherwise the Legion 5 is going to be a great desktop replacement."
Lenovo Thinkpad,When is HP releasing the Envy 2in1s? Been waiting for it since its released in the UK. The Flex looks good but that 45% ntsc screen is a deal breaker for me.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Any good discount code to share, been asking their cso the best I got is 6% off"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Intel is starting to feel the pain with AMD hitting their 2 main cash cows, enterprise and laptop business."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Good friend works as HP Global Sales Director. Slated to arrive Mid June/Early July. And even with him pulling strings, discount quite minimal so yup!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"try entering the code the CSO give u. He gave me the same thing as Roteus did in a PM but when u enter the same code, the discount percentage is far larger.
I suspect from tomorrow on wards, it will be from 6% and not as large as now.
I upgrade to the 2 years onsite for 30 buck.
Also buy via shopback, hopefully got another 5% off
Use my new HSBC credit card where spend above $800 in 1st mth get 150 cashback.
If all goes well, lowish $700 for a AMD zen 2 convertible lappie
Alas the screen is 250 nits, if its a 300 nit screen, it would have been a steal."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The Legion 5 is cheap lol.
I configured for 4800H, 16Gb RAM, 512Gb SSD, 60Hz 300nit IPS sRGB 100% and GTX1650Ti 4Gb, $1689 before discount. Use the CSO coupon. Bring down to $1435. The coupon states up to 6%. But for the discount like this it is 15% off."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The cso coupon is once off or common one?  Can sic if it's latter?
Sent from Rem Best Grill using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Got to key in their REP ID in order to work. So yes once off.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes very true, plus power efficiency is very critical in big data centres, servers as well as laptops. Intel failed in these areas for power efficiency.
My Lenovo S730 is so hot at times that it auto reboot hahaha"
Lenovo Thinkpad,hmm it just die die include the rgb mouse and the backpack in the cart
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ca you share with me your specs and how much you paid?  Also what type of stylus works with it? Is it USI stylus? Any idea of where to buy and how much? Thank you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,You could uncheck the mouse and backpack at the last page.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes. The page got issue. Remove it manually before the checkout. The software, accessories tab."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Any idea what the price would be like? The Envy x360 uses a Realtek Wi-Fi 5 chip instead of the Intel Wi-Fi 6. Seems like a dealbreaker in 2020
Lenovo Thinkpad,"A Chinese review of the Legion 5 4800H known as the R7000 in China versus Legion 5i 10750H Y7000. Short summary: AMD trashes Intel config which costs ~S$320 more, 1650Ti is not worth the upgrade over 1650."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Dunno when the new AMD Thinkpad will be out
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The 1650Ti is not worth the upgrade from 1650 for sure. Considering the key difference between the 2 was the use of GDDR6 vs GDDR5. But now Nvidia have moved all their product stack to GDDR6, so not worth paying that extra 100 bucks to upgrade."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Told you they will find someways to gimp the AMD laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hmm. Is just the screen leh. 60hz 300nits IPS with 100% sRGB. The 120hz panel is with a poorer sRGB lol. How sia.
But from the looks of it a 1650 or 1650ti for AAA game titles i doubt it can hit 120fps unless i lower the graphics settings."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For the price of $1322 after discounts, can get specs of
4600H better than 4700u
128GB SSD
15 inch 100% rgb panel
16GB ram
GTX 1650 4GB
Seems like a better deal than the $1250 Lazada flash sale a few days ago"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Not everyone want to lug a 2.5KG laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Frankly, if I'm willing to lug a 2.5kg laptop, I would expect that they allow me to go for the higher end RTX cards like at least a 2070 so that I can have the option of using it as a desktop replacement with a powerful laptop cooler when I want to realise the full performance. I mean, those have been squeezed into laptops lighter than 2kg, albeit with throttling."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anybody interested in taking over my IdeaPad slim 5 Ryzen 7 4700U please pm me.. I am switching alliances to legion 5 Liao 😂
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It is true if you are looking at just the hardware. But then again, nowadays people want a slim and light laptop. So this may not suit everyone."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Unfortunately, the highest end card you can configure with this is the GTX 1650Ti.
I do agree I won't mind having a greater than 2kg laptop. I don't bring it out often, so weight is no issue for me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,The Legion 5's exact weight is 2.26kg. It is slightly lighter than the Thinkpad T60 I used years ago.
Lenovo Thinkpad,cant imagine you need to travel with that weight during pre wuhan virus period
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think the Legion 5 would be a great lappy for photo editors. Yes it may comes with a crappy gtx1650 or TI. But nevertheless photo editors dont really need one.
I really thinking to buy. But i would love to have at least a gtx1660Ti or rtx2060 for me to game by night lol."
Lenovo Thinkpad,It should have up to rtx though. Maybe can wait as more variant of the model roll out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"2.5kg is really for
a shoulder to cry on

i thinking to change to 16"" mbp to replace my old desktop also to relieve some space on my table.
i wouldn't wanna bring out a 2kg laptop lol
if needed i will just lug my x1c out"
Lenovo Thinkpad,But you need to account for the noise of the fans. These gaming grade laptops normally comes with jet turbine fans at full tilt.

Lenovo Thinkpad,The 300 nits screen is not bright enough.
Lenovo Thinkpad,if its matte screen still ok. glossy gg
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hmm but the intel version 5i put in rtx2060 leh. Lol i think they got space to put a few more heatpipes ba
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Initial marketing material shown that it has up to RTX2060:

But now their product database stated GPU max out at 1650Ti:

Have to wait and see whether will it be equipped with rtx2060 in the future, read from other source that it's varied by region."
Lenovo Thinkpad,once you use UB you don't want to lug 2.5kg liao unless you're BBFA
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Legion = heavy and powerful one put at home.
X1C = light and powerful can bring out
X395 = light and mid-ranged also can bring out"
Lenovo Thinkpad,They still indicate it at the feature / spec page
Lenovo Thinkpad,I believe what they offer may differ between countries/ regions as you rightfully pointed out.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Same laptop model that they reviewed? I feel the 1650 runs hot if the cooling is poor, i.e. slim laptops. I don't know how good is the cooling solution on the Legion 5, but should be good enough to dissipate the heat from a GTX 1650 reasonably well for its size."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Based on HK/UK lenovo site, GTX1660Ti and RTX2060 equipped Legion 5 will be available in 2nd half of the year, varied by regions:"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This is.. looks yummy digress abit from thinkpad.
The specs is interesting. Max TDP? so the graphics component should be close to mx350 if not better?
Some specs:
No dGPU.
4600H/4800H configured to 54W.
91WHr battery.
100% sRGB
Type C charging.
Wifi 6 module.
16GB dual-channel DDR4-3200
Likely aftershock or ?
Pre order in china starts june."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Mayb can adopt the liquid cooling cooling like what the mobile phone is doing?
Sent from Rem Is Best Waifu using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,hopefully we can get reviews soon
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hopefully got good screen too..
actually if you guys want to buy for home use.. the deskmini  akan datang might be better"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I like the form factor of the Deskmini. In fact I was planning to get one with a 3200G to go along as a HTPC. But after much consideration, I decided to just go for an ITX rig instead because I find the chipset and the number of USB ports very limiting. Moreover back then, the fastest DDR4 Sodimm runs at 2933 Mhz and cost a lot more than a pair of desktop DDR4 3200."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"what about now the sodimm still ex???? ITX still a lot bigger right?
the power is with the int. GPU....imho"
Lenovo Thinkpad,tech epiphany does a lot of comparison. just search the model you want
Lenovo Thinkpad,i have 3 usb hubs attached to my deskmini. So from 3 ports > 11 usb ports. no issues so far
Lenovo Thinkpad,"That is one way. I have USB hubs, but would prefer for minimal cables since its on my TV console."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Sodimm is usually more expensive and slower than desktop rams.
Other limitation with the Deskmini is that its OC locked. I was planning to OC it somewhat to squeeze more performance from the GPU in particular."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Got such thing as 1.5kg 4600H?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Sad dont' know my laptop will arrive today not.
It says 20/5/2020 before 9pm
Today morning saw notification saying it cleared customs and I was happy it's coming.
Then look into the tracking notification, it says it's cleared customs in China.
Don't know why my lappy is going from Hong Kong -> Taiwan -> Shenzhen"
Lenovo Thinkpad,May be they realized they forgot to put something in there and requested it back. =p
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can pm me the code pls ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Finally after exactly 1 month.. Laptop shipped out by lenovo... Should have hoot at lazada..
Now I think with ups at China... A few more days to wait.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"mine also.. I think its coz of the plane. doesn't fly direct to sg from hk. so they go tw to pick up, then Shenzhen before coming to sg"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Looking real good.. hope we got local versions.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Now UPS update as still in Shenzhen, delivery rescheduled.
What a bummer."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"There is no chance of you getting it today if the item is still in Shenzhen. Besides flying item over takes time, it needs to clear customs, go to the sorting hub before it gets dispatched. So all in all, it could take an extra day or 2."
Lenovo Thinkpad,waiting for ryzen 4000 series thinkpad laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ups show Mine is hefei to shanghai now..
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If shanghai only then still long way.
Mine went to HK and KR then come down to SG.
That also delay in SG. I ordered my E595 when CB started. Only to receive it last 3 weeks back.
Overall will take between 3 wks to 4 wks to ship."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It was already shipped, not in production stage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The strange travel pattern could likely be attributed to the fact that there are a lot of travel restrictions. So perhaps from HK, there is no direct flight because have not lifted ban to travel to SG. So a lot of walkaround to get the product on our shores resulting in delays."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yes. Go one big round then reach you. Their tracking now also very hard to believe.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just got the expected date for my Flex 14 to arrive.. It's almost a 1.5 month wait for them to ship the product. It's REALLY long and I might be thinking of a cancellation.
Just a heads-up for the rest of you yea"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hope it's only due to Covid-19. Lenovo should not sell laptops if they are unable to fulfill delivery deadline.
My last ThinkPad also got delayed and they promised to compensate a cheap HDD which they didn't even keep to it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think there are multiple hurdles for them to fulfill orders quickly.
1. Low supply of components, and I believe supply for Renoir is still very limited
2. Limited number of flights to transport components due to historic low travel, and to also deliver the product to you
3. Travel restrictions affects point 2
So if you need a laptop urgently, you should get one where stock is available locally. If you customize or pre-order, it will take quite long at this point. Unless the 3 points above improve in the near future."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just wanted to share my purchase.
I got a Lenovo E595 recently and it's customized.
Ordered May 15, Shipped May 19, Expected to arrive May 22.
Perhaps its running on the older ryzen and they trying to clear stock."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Better check periodically. I ordered during first day of cb. And it only came 3 weeks later.
Not to wet blanket you, the shipping time is like a rubber kind. I from April 22nd delivery date but rubber till 29th April. And that also got delayed to be shipped to my house. I got it only 1st May."
Lenovo Thinkpad,whoa that is super long wait
Lenovo Thinkpad,"On its website also mentioned 6-8 weeks

Now. Latest update.... At Korean inchon.. Around 12pm..
Ups put expected delivery date as 22may. 9pm.. Doubt I can get it tomorrow..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeap, it was altered after. On the day I placed the order, it was stated as within 2 weeks. Checked with CSO as well. Mine's a Ready to Ship order.
Granted it's Covid and I've tailored my expectations for the arrival, but it still is a far stretch.
Not angry or pissed, just...sian?
Anyway, sent a mail to their CS about this issue. Will update."
Lenovo Thinkpad,locally retails all closed. how to buy. online is the oinly way
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, I mean online. Even on Lazada, you can find laptops that they can deliver same day, if not next day. May not be the config that you want, but the option is there. I was anticipating more delays with Renoir laptops, so I pulled the trigger on a laptop with Ice Lake and it arrived the same day I ordered."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yea because the stock is sitting in an SG warehouse
Lenovo Thinkpad,same here buddy..think im gon cancel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Any touch screen laptop with latest AMD Ryzen to intro?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Envy x360 but not out yet
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If not urgent just wait lo,  treat it as a pre-order
Sent from Rem Best Grill using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo got local store in SG too or they can have an improved delivery timing like 1 to 1.5 weeks the most. 3 to 4 weeks is too long.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Their local store is run by addon systems. Think they are found on Lazada
Lenovo's warehouse is in Malaysia... Same as dell"
Lenovo Thinkpad,dell US also out liao.. not shure SG
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If it's 3 to 4 weeks, I doubt it's actually coming from an inventory locally.
I've no idea about Lenovo's supply chain, but I do know Apple uses a major logistics provider to warehouse their supply chain in SG, releasing online purchases to 4 different couriers to deliver in SEA region previously worked with one of the couriers"

Ryzen 7 3700u
8gb ram + 8gb sodimm
512gb SSD
Full hd display 400 nits should be 100% sRGB

Lenovo Thinkpad,suggest u take a look at lenovo sg site better
Lenovo Thinkpad,"new intel thinkpads avaliable in US.
base on their manual..T14s only 1 heatpipe..
if they use this for the amd variant.
better to get T14 for better performance?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Any opinion on this? I saw last year NDP period got similar price... Thinking maybe I sell my XPS 13 hopefully can fetch 2k plus once I get my new replacement unit and get this... Upgrade to wireless AX on my own. Keep the extra 1k for other purposes.
How much is T14 AMD expected to cost when it comes out?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"how much do you think my S730 yoga can sell. still got warranty. 6 months or so. worth to upgrade?
i5-8565
16gb
512ssd"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Don't think Legion series has international warranty. Besides you need to factor in GST unless the seller under-declares the product value.
Lenovo Thinkpad,probably 1k or 1.1k if in good condition...
Lenovo Thinkpad,"1 heatpipe, unless its a big one, otherwise do expect quite a fair bit of throttling."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"not worth since entry level 4300u outperforms 3700u

Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks bro. Didn't know the perf gap was so wide...
Lenovo Thinkpad,"4th gen ryzen is really blowing the competition right now...
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"In terms of CPU, Renoir certainly have an advantage over the Ryzen 7 3700U, but when it comes to graphics, I think the latter is more formidable assuming cooling is not a problem."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It is. Intel have nothing to compete in the laptop space when it comes to CPU. So they start trumpeting the high clockspeed which it can never hit with the cooling capability of almost all the laptops. GPU wise, I think Tiger Lake may be able to compete with Renoir, but that is not enough to give them the advantage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yup..
looks like T14 is the better choice."
Lenovo Thinkpad,do you have the t495? Just wondering how performance is like
Lenovo Thinkpad,They compete by cutting prices.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"T495 is amazingly good. I am using 1 now with 1TB, 32GB Ram and 400 nits display, and even had a SIM slot. It gets all the job done and had a 89% grade on notebookcheck.com.
If you can wait then get the new Ryzen CPU. I am eagerly anticipating manufacturers to release their Renoir offerings."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Nope. Was originally planning to get a T495, but went with the IdeaPad 5 instead. My feedback was purely looking at the specs. Renoir is clearly a better choice if CPU is your key focus, and less so on the graphics. Renoir's top end chip with Vega 7 or 8 may not be a problem, but at the lower end, the Vega 5 and 6, may not fare as well even with a hefty clockspeed advantage when you compare it with the Vega 10 on the 3700U."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Price cutting is not the Intel style man. At least looking at current laptops with Intel processors in there, I don't see a meaningful price decline despite Renoir being made official and released."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I feel specs and build wise, it is great. But cooling wise, I think it is no better than the E485 I had previously, looking at some of the images. This is not surprising given the size. The successor I think will be even slimmer, and not sure if the ram is still upgradeable. I suspect it will be soldered."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks. How much did you pay for this spec? Right now the guy on Carousell is offering $1,080 for 8GB RAM or $1,150 with an extra 8GB RAM in the open slot. I don't know if he can be trusted but I guess I can look at the box to confirm the specs before buying.
I'm just wondering whether price wise, will the T14 AMD become similarly expensive like the Intel counterparts. The L14 Intel already starts at US$1,389 in the US, and that's with an i3 and 4GB of RAM...
I thought quite a bit about my requirements, and I guess CPU performance just needs to be 'good enough' for me
- Decent graphics to be able to run dual 4K@60Hz not for gaming
- Keyboard area doesn't heat up under normal use
- No lag when web browsing, running WordPress, using Lightroom to make image edits, etc.
- Good battery life -- 5-6 hours on web browsing?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Even the base Legion 515 with Ryzen 5 4600H this new CPU is as fast or slightly faster than i7-9750
Much less the 4800U one Im getting.
I configured one with 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, GTX1650 Non Ti and 120Hz screen.. used the code the CSO gave, only $1333 on Lenovo SG website.
The only drawback is long waiting time. Min 6-8 weeks"

But the discount % is different across different models it seems.. and slightly better than Shopback18"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Whoops... Big typo there
Always find it confusing when they refer to 3rd gen Ryzen processors but the model numbers all start with 4000..."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Aite thanks!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I rmbr it as Laptop range being one gen behind.. easier 😅
But the 4600/4800H really impressive based on benchmarks on YouTube."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Flex 5 with DDR4 16gb ram, Ryzen 7 4700u, 1tb ssd is only $1000+ after the best promo code given by a friendly CA."
Lenovo Thinkpad,The promo codes given by the CSO must be use with including the CSO ID else You will receive a call asking for the name of the CSO and sadly the order will be cancelled if you are unable to provide The necessary information
Lenovo Thinkpad,Then it means you just need to remember code and CSO ID.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wonder what's the graphics performance with 16gb of ram?
so far see reviews all is 8g...
dual channel.. how much more performance can we squeeze for the IGPU.
The screen is not fantastic also.. need some calibration i think."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"interesting... vega 6 versus mx350..
4500U..
So 4700u or 4800u with decent cooling should get us close.
dual channel fast ram should help also. feed that beast!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,mx350 still very entry right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,New BIOS update 1.57 released for E485/E585
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Mx350 is still a faster card imo. If based on paper specs
4600U < 4700U < 4800U < Mx350
But the difference between 4800U to Mx350 performance very negligible. If feed the 4800U 3200Mhz ram assuming if it can support yes it will match the mx350.
Its not easy for a iGPU to beat entirely a dedicated gpu such as gtx1650 onwards. Probably not now. But in the future it can be done if they can shrink to a smaller process node to pack more transistor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone waiting for the new yoga slim 7?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Not too bad. It's a slower gtx1050 mobile I think
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ports wise the Acer beats the Lenovo. Comes with 10gbps usb 3.1, displayport 1.4, hdmi 2.0 and wifi6. If you want something more future proof this is it. No point having so much power when you realise down the road you cannot hook it up to multiple displays etc... Limits its potential. Plus no need to wait 4 weeks for shipping."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"yep considered ""dedicated"" entry level gpu..
good enough for light gaming in a slim form factor.
if can reach that level on a IGPU..feed it with the dual channel high speed ram, decent cooling, drawing lesser power, we got legit hot cake cpu!
Unfortunately we are pretty much limited by what OEM or manufacturer willing to spec.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I felt we should not be expecting a lot from ultra series. Perhaps just getting the 4500U is the best already. need to manage battery time also
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I paid $1,123.76 with mouse, bag and 3 years onsite warranty.
T495 hdmi and USB c should be able to power 2 x 4k screen. please double check
Running WordPress and lightroom should be fine. Battery life is worse than Intel version. Is he selling ryzen 5 or ryzen 7 version? Please note that mine is Ryzen 5 only.
If you can, please wait for another 2 months for the new CPU. The performance is much better then the present CPU."
Lenovo Thinkpad,They had announced price cut at least in America.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I also had E585, Ryzen 7 2700U, 16GB, 512GB and 1 TB SSD.
Built quality, T495 is much better. And comes with fingerprint, hello windows login. Better WiFi, mic and screen. Of course it also cause more"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ryzen 7 but I guess not much diff since all quad core. Wow okay, didn't know it was so cheap back then"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Just saw some shopee and Lazada promoting Lenovo IdeaPad 5 4700U
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,They have live chat on the website. Very eager to answer any query. Not difficult to get the code.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you check YouTube.. MX350 means gaming everything on Low 1080P with roughly 40-50 FPS max. Some even need one notch lower to 900P or 720P.
Not worth it for me.. min is 1650 for me. Which the Legion can be had for base $1299 before discount. Around $1180."
Lenovo Thinkpad,You should check out Lenovo's website
Lenovo Thinkpad,Which is why iirc nvidia supposedly going to launch mx450 which make mx350 the lower end model
Lenovo Thinkpad,"1080p low with 40-50fps is still pretty good for the weight.
Mainly for light gaming is fine.
For heavier gaming.. i advise minimum at least a dedicated gpu.
I feel at that point the price and category is different already"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"agreed. T495 quality is much better.
Hoping the T14 is good also"
Lenovo Thinkpad,indeed it is easy to get the codes but there are many variety of codes granting different % of discount. Neither LENOVOPRO or THANKYOU gives the best discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This would interesting.
big batt.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You are not wrong from the customer standpoint.
But Say the CSO gave you a limited ""PROMO"" code that can only be given out to selective customers.. and we, the customer shared around, the CSO will have a hard time explaining to the team head why so many people are using the ""LIMITED"" promo code tagged with his CSO ID.
however the above doesnt apply to THANKYOU & LENOVOPRO as those are not limited promo codes. so feel free to spam"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Now quite expensive leh. 1.6k for similar config. You bought during the NDP promo previously?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"CSO ID, that should never change. As to why you need to message the CSO for the code in the first place, I think its just pure marketing. At the checkout page, they even prompt you to speak to the CSO for better offer. Personally, I feel they could have just auto apply the codes, but for PR stunt, this additional step of asking for better offer through the CSO, probably just makes the person feel better after seeing a better discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Imo, i felt that those wanna game e sports title, you should be getting minimally a gtx1650/Ti. This will churn out pretty well fps for those e sports games and some indie games. This gtx1650ti wont break the bank with any config be it intel or amd. With price bracket between $1.2k-$1.4k depending on the storage and memory config.
Some AAA game titles you will need a gtx1660Ti instead. This is the so call sweet spot for 1080p gaming with a few textures tone down in settings, you should be able to rock those games well. There is a leap in performance from a gtx1650 to gtx1660Ti. And of cause with that said, it cost anywhere from $1.6k till 2.2k between intel or amd and depending on the storage and memory config. Also this category got many price range. From lousy screens to good screens.
With just 10% more improvement comes the rtx2060. Now this is where i find its the limit for laptop gaming should go. The amount of heat coming out in most gaming laptop can rather be very toasty. Of cause its faster than the gtx1660Ti. But not much difference. And most of the laptop pricing starts from 2.2k onwards.
Then comes the atas rtx2070-2080. Which imo, this route is far too ex and a lot of cooling needed for a laptop. And the price for it is far too much to ask for. If one needed that level of gaming performance, a desktop would be a better buy. Or perhaps a small ITX rig to bring around if needed lol."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Prior to landing on Lenovos offer for Legion 515 at around $1180 with above said GPU base model, Ive seen so many with worse off GPU like MX250/350 at prices between $1200-1400
A maxed out Legion 5 with Ryzen 7 4800H and GTX1650 Ti, 16GB DDR4 RAM and 512GB SSD is only $1450 after discount. So tempting!!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Bro pls share if you got better one.
Ive tried both the above 2 codes, they work out to be the same % discount. Thanks!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,ya... the price is tempting!
Lenovo Thinkpad,thinkpad series probably the 1650/1660 in the extreme series..
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeap yeap. Remember ah guys, dont just aim for the highest spec and just hantam money on it.
Look at the cooling potential first before buying. Dont just buy blindly and thinking that hey my gpu or cpu is suppose to be fast! But in actual fact slows down because hitting the temps limit."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I have talk to cso for promo code , in the end after the comparison the shopback18 still better"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi,anyone bought the legion 15 what configuration do you choose"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Currently out of stock but ships to SG. About 1k SGD after gst and shipping
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ryzen 7 4800H
512gb ssd
Gtx1650
100% SRGB screen
16gb ram
$1219
Excluding ShopBack rebate 5%"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi,how about the ram?which coupon did you use"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think it depends on the weight for the laptop. Most sub 2KG laptops should sport a MX series graphic card.
The likes of Legion 5 is more on the gaming laptop. But I agree that the Legion 5 is very enticing."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yoga slim 7 China review out here:
First impressions is hot, and issues outputting to 4k display. Build quality also not as good as the older s740 which I thought was pretty bad when I owned it lol"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"What code did you use?
I cant bring it to that price with those specs."

Lenovo Thinkpad,The legion 5 gtx1650 upgrade to gtx1650ti is it worth?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My friend's order for Legion 5 just shipped from factory. Not yet arrived. Took only 1 week to ship, not 6-8 weeks."
Lenovo Thinkpad,The Chinese review mentioned it is just 6-7 fps difference in most games between the 2 cards.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"13"" redmi
250 nits
AMD Ryzen 7 4700U CPU Vega 8 graphics paired with 16 GB RAM and a 1 TB SSD
Probably less than <S$1,200"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Its around 5-10% faster or more FPS. At lower settings and older games the diff in performance is more pronounced but this means little to me since I will play my games in 1080P high settings if possible.
Cost diff is around $70-80 premium after using discount code.
I havent buy yet, waiting for the guy earlier to share his code."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"5%-10% improvement. The real leap would be the gtx1660ti. There is a gap in between this and gtx1650 or 1650ti. But one must take account on what games are you gonna play.
1660ti is quite close to the rtx2060. Just do not have ray tracing hardware in it. But even if it has ray tracing, gtx1660ti sure bo muscle to run smoothly."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yes correct.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"GPU experts.. GTX1650 have DDR5 and DDR6, big diff?
Lenovo CSO told me GTX1650 Max-Q means equal to desktop counterpart hence better than normal GTX1650. Zhun bo?? 😂"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Anyone also looking at ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 GA401V? Seems to have many rave reviews.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I see,Same here hope to get for best discount code before purchasing🙂"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"1650 to 1650ti the difference.. i feel not worth the extra money..
if jump to 1660TI than ya got difference."
Lenovo Thinkpad,can't pre order on taobao leh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeap. Gaming is concern then get 1660ti and above.
Not unless your gaming at low or indie games or some less intensive esports title."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can

Lenovo Thinkpad,Redmibook 13 doesn't seem like 100% sRGB? Plus no type c port at all...
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I just realized it as well, i thought they refreshed the 13"" model

Lenovo Thinkpad,Seem ex since someone got even for 1219 right
Lenovo Thinkpad,cant get it to that price even with the -15%
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My setting above is with Premium 2 years warranty and service + 16gb ram

Lenovo Thinkpad,hmm not looking at the 4500 u
Lenovo Thinkpad,"if I roll-back to 4600H, it will be under 1.2K"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is 4800h worth the upgrade over 4600h?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I just ran CB R20 on my Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5. It has Ryzen 7 4700U.
The scores came out to be 3004. I couldn't believe my eyes since YT reviewers got around ~2600ish. So I ran it again. Guess what? 3020!
At a score of 3020, it is on par with the i9-9880H 8c/16t, 45W, and handily beats the i7-9750H 6c/12t, 45W, 2550ish.
This seems very weird to me as the 4700U is 8c/8t, and 15W TDP. Plus, the score is 400ish higher than YT reviewers.
P.S. My desktop 3600 manages 3500ish."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Order from where?
Lenovo Thinkpad,whoa! with decent cooling its doing well
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The weird thing is the Ideapad Slim 5 is a thin and light laptop. It's 1.5/1.6kg, and very slim. The cooling solution is very basic. Looking at the result for the U variant, I think the H variant is even more OP-ed.
Quite a number of YT reviewers have published performance results for the 4900HS, and it absolutely creams the i9-9980HK even when the Intel chip is running at max TDP with the best cooling solution.
Thanks AMD, for kicking Intel in the nuts with this sick release!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"From Lenovo official lor
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi, where did you buy the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5 from?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,No so cheap leh.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The problem with the Intel chips is that they are not able to sustain a reasonably high clockspeed. Which is why they are lagging behind. Despite a lower TDP, AMD chips can sustain a higher clockspeed due to the significantly more power efficient 7nm, as compared to Intel's 14nm. Intel chips still have the advantage if they can clock higher than a Zen 2 chip, but in the case of a laptop, heat and power severely limits their whatever clockspeed boost technology."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This shows the efficiency gap between 7nm and 14nm. Couple with an ageing architecture, Intel is not competitive in the mobile space anymore. I feel even Tiger Lake U on 10nm will not turn their misfortunes around."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Infinito Atrix. They are active in Lazada and Shopee. There's a thread in the Tech Show sub-forum warning about their dubious business practices but I decided to go with them since the huge number of positive reviews on both platform cannot lie.
This particular model is going for 1298 on Shopee. Their store on Lazada price it at 1498. However, now already OOS, need pre-order with arrival in mid-July.
Another thing to note is that this is the only model out of the many, many models, to offer 3 years on-site warranty, which is a great advantage."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I gonna get:
Ryzen 7 4800H
16GB RAM and 512GB SSD
GTX1650 Ti with 120Hz screen 250 nitz
+ 2 year premium warranty supposedly the best, got promo, only +$36
Lowest Ive gotten is $1405 using Shopback18 code, before Shopback cashback and CC points.
If you buy the base model $1299 with code, you can get as low as around $1100 or so before Shopback cashback.
I still waiting for that guy to see how he got $1219 with the above setup or similar"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I almost bought this too. Realized the U behind the processed is slower than H version. Also the integrated GPU in the AMD processor is only on par with MX350 level. So didnt fit my needs
Then I chanced on Lenovo Legion 5"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you are able to get an offer for the same configuration, please share and let us know haha
Cuz Lenovo has a ""Price-Match"" guarantee
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"So can they price match the 1219? Can show forum post haha
Also,
Lenovo s540 - 4800U 13 inch coming to SG
Legion 5 - 1660ti & 2060 coming 2nd half of the year"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"1660Ti or more then the price gonna be bumped up to $1800 liao maybe.
Now settling on 4800H / GTX1650 Ti is more than enough for my needs and budget."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not with promo code 15-18% off . Likely ard 1.5k, or 150-250 more from current 1.3-1-4K
Also, for most people 4600H / 1660ti would be better combo than 4800h/1650ti for around the same price"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ok thanks!,i think will wait for the higher discount code as not urgently need it🙂"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Thanks!!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yep, for gaming purposes, you will need something better. I bought this for my sis who is starting uni soon, and she don't game at all. Her priority is thin and light"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"1.4kg not really that light though. There are other options like asus um433, 1.1kg"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Agree. If want light, should look at Asus zenbook or Acer swift 3/ 5 or LG Gram 13
All around 1Kg
My ryzen pro 3500 so far is great for work.
Can easily handle 3D software, Photoshop 200 layers, PPT with 500 slides

Lenovo Thinkpad,well.... I think Lenovo Singapore will price-match or give a better offer than local Singapore vendors
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You could have saved 100 bucks by going for the GTX 1650, instead of the Ti version. Basically Nvidia just upgraded to the GTX 1650 to GDDR6, so I don't see a difference between the Ti and non Ti version."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, but they cost more. The Swift 3 is the cheapest, but the display is very poor."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Asus is the same price A lot lighter and double the storage but half the ram.
Also, the white keyboard not for everyone."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Looks decent, though I would have preferred more RAM than storage. The latter can be upgraded, but not the soldered on RAM.
Actually I was reading the review for this Asus laptop version with dedicated GPU and I kind of wonder which ""genius"" came out with the idea of this hidden exhaust between the hinge. Its a downright dumb design. Quite a lot of slim profile laptops come with this silly design because its almost like the vents are semi blocked. I was also worried about how the hot air coming out from it is cooking my laptop's LCD screen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thats just asus ergo lift vent, think all their zenbook push out hot air like that. Even the g14 which would be more concerning"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The Asus Zenbook models cost quite a bit more ~150. And I realise they are actually shipping out with 3700U huh??why???
Meanwhile, the Acer Swift 3 comes with 4500U, and the warranty is 2yr Carry-in. And as mentioned, the display is really bad.
Meanwhile, this Lenovo unit has 3yr on-site. Display isn't great, but good enough. And man, that 4700U smokes even Intel's i9 gaming CPU"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I havent got it yet. Waiting for the fella share his code.
With Shopback18 code, the diff between Ti or not is around $60-70 I think."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Both Lenovo and asus cost the same -$1398
Lenovo Thinkpad,My friend's Legion 5 arrived liao. Ordered last last weekend.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi,Hows the performance and which promo code he used to purchase?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I paid 1263 for the Lenovo. Plus, 3700U is leagues slower than 4700U, since it uses the 12nm Zen architecture. If only, the Asus used the 4700U, then it's a no-brainer"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yours seem on discount and not sticker price. You probably could get the asus for similar price after promo discount. Got a $1398 zenbook @ $1218 during it show 2 years ago
The 3700U is enough for moderate user who want more storage and lighter laptop. Theres another um433 version with 4700u + mx350 coming later."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"those of you who can wait....
Dell USA just released a new G15 gaming laptop which is AMD ryzen 7 CPU + AMD GPU
AMD Ryzen™ 5 4600H + exclusive AMD Radeon™ RX 5600M 880 USD
or
AMD Ryzen™ 7 4800H + exclusive AMD Radeon™ RX 5600M 1200 USD"
Lenovo Thinkpad,let us know your friend's review
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Errr.. I don't think Dell SG will bring in AMD desktop/laptop here.
Tried to ask them in the past for Ryzen 3 series, they say they won't
bring in AMD products here.
Not sure whether will change or not but unlikely.
So far they are the only brand that doesn't have any AMD OEM products in SG.
Asus, HP, Lenovo, Acer all have except Dell.
Those interested may have to buy from Dell US store and there is way to do so."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hi all the legion has caught my eyes since it seems local g14 gonna be over priced. I'm reading on some coupon codes? What's the best deal for a full spec legion 15? Thanks alot
Lenovo Thinkpad,"G14 and legion not same category though, ~1kg weight / size difference.
In terms of weight / size theres no alternative to g14 so can try to import it.
Or can wait for a15 with 4900H"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Tbh the gtx1650/Ti is a deal breaker. If you really into gaming, you would wanna wait till the gtx1660Ti or rtx2060 be available. Else you pretty much have to sacrifice a lot of graphics settings just to play smoothly.
Apart from that the fast 144hz is ok but not meant for editing photos. But the way if you gonna have the 144hz panel you must reconsider if the gtx1650Ti is even able to produce that many frames for it. Which imo not easy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"seems like bestbuy is the only option for R9 specced. looks like the best value as well.
bestbuy USD1,450 - 4900HS / 16GB / 1TB / RTX 2060 MQ
taobao RMB12,199 - 4800HS / 16GB / 1TB / RTX 2060 MQ
shopee 5cgo SGD2,258 - 4800HS / 16GB / 1TB / GTX 1660 Ti"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For those interested. GTX1650 versus the Ti version.
Personally, seems like can run most games smoothly and comfortably. Good enough for me.
In real world diff in prices its like around $60-70."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Shows how overpriced SG version is for 4600 / 1650 @ $2.5k
Asus SG still think economy very good"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Seem like its 1650 gddr 5 version though
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Other than ezbuy, any other recommended forwarder to check out for US to SG?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Some scores for my friend's Legion 5 4800H GTX 1650:
Cinebench R20: 4329 default settings out of box
Crystaldiskmark: 3570R 2982W SSD is a good one...512GB Samsung PM981a
Didn't ask him to run other tests. He said the laptop doesn't feel hot or noisy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,And the one we are getting for Legion 5 is DDR6 so should be slightly better.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Which would make the jump to 1650ti less worth it
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If that is smooth, i think you might really reconsider. The frames were between 30+ to 40+ FPS range average. To play really smoothly you will need to push down more graphic settings to make it 60FPS to be smooth. Then this is for current gen of games. Next gen worth of games come in, you got to change a new laptop?? Lol
Get somewhere mid tier gtx1660ti and rtx2060."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Screen is good!

Lenovo Thinkpad,"The only forwarders I can think of is comgateway or Vpost.
If u got singpost stand chart credit card, Vpost got discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,When will the 1660ti be out. My main purpose of the laptop is to use on bed when nuaing. Play some games once a while. Big titles leave it for desktop. So after seeing g14 1k+ more I might as well save the 1k buy a legion then use the savings for a new gpu.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Q2 2020, no exact date though.
Watched some reviews from china said that SSD for legion 5 no guarantee is pm981a, depend on lottery luck."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hmmmm seems like both promo code thankyou or shopback last day is tmr thinking hoot or dont
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If they can charge $100 for a gtx1650 to gtx1650Ti. Im very sure the gtx1660Ti will cost a lot more. Rtx2060 lagi no need to think. Should be a premium of $400 or more.
The downside is the 60hz if people want a 100% sRGB screen. Else a 144Hz if they only wanna game. If really wanna compare. The legion 5 all out specs should be very close to $2k-ish.
Also g14 is something of a different league. It is small and lightweight. Unlike the Legion 5 which is a massive 2.5kg laptop.
I think it is best to wait awhile more and see what has to offer ba. Legion 5 is promising. But lack in screen specs, graphics card specs now. Also the weight can be a concern for some."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"After ""lurking"" here for quite some time , finally pull the plug on the Legion 5 this afternoon with some haggling with the rep with the Shopback18 discount code and an additional 2%. Finally got the follow spec at 1380.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"i'm considering the options below and would appreciate any suggestions/advice.
usage mostly at home so portability is not really a concern. for me to game and kids to use for HBL while i wait for the ryzen 4000 desktop chip to build a proper gaming rig at the end of the year.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Oh... Didn't know that. I don't think we can buy direct from the lenovo china site right? Sorry am a banana can't read that much chinese LOL
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Same thinking. AAA titles game on desktop better.
If I buy the Legion 5, got extra budget to upgrade desktop specs.
1660Ti maybe abit too much of a price bump later too. And I dont like to wait for impulse purchases"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi,where do you get the additional 2% off"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi all.
Those of you who own an E595 AMD, is the keyboard backlit?
I don't see the option to have a backlit keyboard for the E595 in the Lenovo SGP website.
Having said that, I'm waiting for the successor E15 with the newer AMD CPUs to reach us before making a purchase decision.
Thanks in advance."

Lenovo Thinkpad,wah free xbox? how to know if still available
Lenovo Thinkpad,"R7 4800H / 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD / GTX1650 Ti / 120Hz screen / Promo upgrade to 2 years on site premium care
Lowest it can go with Shopback18 is $1405.50 before CC rebate and Shopback 5% cashback. Before code is around $1706."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Means you need to max out the Legion 5 and buy 1TB SSD then apply code maybe have more than $1500 to get the free Xbox, assuming not snapped up yet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,the xbox doesnt appear in the cart...dont even know if still have anot
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You need use they live chat cos they will give you the code
btw they giving  free Lenovo Legion M200 RGB Gaming Mouse, 2Y Premium Care with Onsite upgrade from 1Y Depot/CCI, Lenovo Legion 15.6-inch Recon Gaming Backpack, Lenovo Original powerbank 5000mAH"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If those items are checked before you click customize, they make the base price jump from 1299 to near 1400, even before you change the cpu/ram others options. Not sure if they really free."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You talk so much about getting a good deal end up dont wanna share the code or its a code that cannot be shared.
Waste people time."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Waste whose time ? Yours ?
If I can really afford to share, I definitely will, but obviously I can't because the promo code is individual sales agent limited, meaning to say each sales agent can only have that limited amount of people using and quote the sales person ID. Any more they sales agent  will have a hard time to answer for it.
My point to bring across is the promo codes you guys received from the live chat chaps are not the best and you can only continue to request for the ultimate code and hopefully one of the agent with sufficient "" slot"" can afford to share with you.
Once again, I did post up my deal and offering for anybody to take over at cost and someone managed to snap it up before you did, so please don't be mad. Cheers"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not mad. The diff isnt big to me. I got 2 units ytd.
But you share like never share. And you still dont get it.
Its like when I buy a new Mercedes then I quickly go car forum and tell people I got it 10% lower cost than everyone else nett price but actually not a repeatable deal.
Next time such things you keep quiet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"In your context of mercedes, instead of what you have presented,  it is more of like me sharing there are better promo codes and you guys need to continue to dig more. It is a repeatable deal if you can get the agent to disclose to you. Obviously I ain't an agent else I would have love to share with everybody to earn the comms.
Next time read carefully and don't 以小人之心度君子之腹"
Lenovo Thinkpad,So whats the % discount that the agent gave you? If people know then everyone can just keep trying to get an agent that can give them that % discount.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"legion got 2.5"" i want no 2.5"" slot becos its waste of space. I saw ideapad 5 14"" version, i considering it.. but i wanna see if there's any other option. Seem like ryzen laptop still not many."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Any comments on this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,lenovo said as long as banner still there xbox promotion still on
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Other than the guy who reserved your paid set, no one else benefited from your sharing.
So next time just shut up."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Is this the best combination now i can only make it to 1405. They are not able to give me further discount ? i am looking actually. my 10 yrs old alienware is going to give up on me anytime soon .
also comparing with aftershock forge 15s"
Lenovo Thinkpad,This the internal for Ideapad 5 Ryzen 15inch:
Lenovo Thinkpad,imo just max spec it with the 1tb ssd. it ends up at 1520. purchase now with a free xbox one s which u can discard later for around 300
Lenovo Thinkpad,u dont spec the 1tb ssd u wont hit 1.5k for free xbox
Lenovo Thinkpad,"will be 1577 after i spec the 1tb . is 1 tb really necessary?
cause the first HD was already 1 tb."
Lenovo Thinkpad,imo dont spec the hdd? just spec the 1tb ssd and its already 1520
Lenovo Thinkpad,bro can check your pm?
Lenovo Thinkpad,The discount I gotten was from one CSO rep whom I mentioned that I have the shopback18 promo discount code and if they were to provide me another 2% discount from the cart I will order it immediately. Hence this price and the rep manual override the cart price from their end.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Got one CSO mentioned they additional 2% off is case by case basis, based on specs you chose. If you max it out then the deal is too good then likely their manager wont approve the 2% adjustment.
So $1405.50 is the best if you want Max CPU RAM GPU and 512GB SSD. Before CC/Shopback rebate.
If you drop the Ti version for GPU I think it goes to $1323 or so. Some say the Ti version not worth, only 5-8% faster or more FPS.
Above is all including the 2 year premium onsite care."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"the honor magicbook sold in malaysia more worth it
this matebook d 15, no backlit keyboard, 15-inch model yet keyboard is the TKL type [meaning no dedicated Page Up / Page Down keys, no dedicated number pad], type-c port doesn't support display out."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Around 25%-30% I think

decided to go on this setup @$1313.10 before 5% shopback"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi,if using promo code not from shopback still eligible for the cashback?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wrong concept. 2280 has more space to distribute heat as it is longer vs 2242 version.
Lenovo Thinkpad,170Watt power supply. This laptop sure taking up lots of power.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It is true that 2280 have more space for better heat distribution. The first time I used a 2242 NVME drive that came with my IdeaPad 5, I was shocked how hot it is. At idle, you probably see like 50+ degs, and even with gaming load, its hitting 81 degs and throttling. This is despite me adding a copper heatspread to it. None of the 2280 NVME drive ever hit this sorts of temp, with 50+ being the highest I've seen. When I was cloning this drive to a new Adata SSD, I placed a ramsink on the 2242 drive, and it was scorching hot to the touch."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This is a gaming grade laptop, so not unexpected that the power supply is higher. In fact, I feel whether it really consumes that much power or not, I rather they provide a higher waltage power supply just in case. This should give the CPU more power for short term boost. My guess is that the full power draw may end up peaking around 150W based on the specs."
Lenovo Thinkpad,What coupon to get that price?
Lenovo Thinkpad,I believe that coupon has expired. Was for may.
Lenovo Thinkpad,This price KYM?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Should be Shopback18. So far its better than THANKYOU with CSO ref number or LENOVOPRO
I used the same to get 2 units: 4800H/16GB RAM/512GB SSD/120Hz screen/1650 Ti with 2 YRS premium care ~$1405 each"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think for this price, getting from Lenovo SG would be better well worth it due to the warranty support"
Lenovo Thinkpad,So did you buy also?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Anyway why did you give it up?
You upgrade to another gaming laptop?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yep ordered also. After all discount with rebate is 1.4k full specs 1tb with 1650ti. Then xbox also
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi,you qualify for the xbox?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Err.. careful, laptop/desktop from China comes with Chinese OS."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Nope. When I buy no more liao
Or maybe it's for single unit purchase above 1.5K only

I wanna try high refresh rate because haven't tested before so I settled for the base screen."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"250nits with 144hz is actually very dull. Especially it is not sRGB 100%. Furthermore, gtx1650 or Ti is not gonna make the 144hz panel looks good either."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I chose the 60Hz coz I want the 100% srgb and brighter screen. Anyways none of the gpu can do 120hz beautifully
Lenovo Thinkpad,"1650 with 144hz panel is quite moot imo..
unless you willing to pretty much sacrifice the quality for the fps.
1650 with a high nits, 100 rgb and 60hz would be better imo"

Lenovo Thinkpad,"You will feel the difference on normal windows interface usage and low demand gaming. However for this model  1650ti / 1650  i doubt you will be able to run smoothly at full 120hz for AAA Games.
Screen tearing could be an issue due to absence of Free Sync / GSync"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Read again.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No one look at the Eluktronics Ryzen option? They will be shipping from July.
So far I am keen looking at T14 or this."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Eluktronics sell in SG? If need import warranty an issue.
Lenovo Thinkpad,They shipped to Singapore according to their website and new egg selling too. Only worried about support.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"they are using OEM chassis right?
might as well wait for aftershock."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Or you can consider checking with Aftershock to see if they will bring in the same chassis and specs. If they are going to at some point, then no harm waiting."
Lenovo Thinkpad,With aftershock then need include markup
Lenovo Thinkpad,"T14 -
T14s -
X13 -
wonder which screen is the best option for T14
14.0"" FHD 1920x1080Low Power IPS Anti-glare - 400 nits 16:9 800:1 72% 170°
14.0""FHD 1920x1080 ThinkPad Privacy Guard IPS Anti-glare Multitouch 500 nits 16:9 1000:1 72% 170°
These two should be the best option. alas.. no 100 percent?
These two option the laptop will also be lighter"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The 72% probably refers to NTSC gamut, so equivalent to 100% sRGB"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"good that lenovo didnt nerf the amd variants so badly
next qn will be if the amd price will be more competitive?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hope it's more competitive. The question is when it will reach sg. The psref only got 8gb config available for t14 and x13 in Singapore
Lenovo Thinkpad,"500 nits is very bright. Even for outdoor usage, I feel a 400 nits brightness should be more than enough."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Content creation needs a brighter screen
Lenovo Thinkpad,"More than enough vs more the merrier.....
Then why need HDR 1000? If got options. I'd choose more. And dial back if needed."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"really?
wha.. heng ah!
come on lenovo sg! where issit!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"500 nits come with privacy screen, which affects brightness somewhat.
Otherwise, High nits is more for HDR support"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Dunno man..i gave up. Decided to keep my XPS 13 3 replacement set instead of selling.
It better not appear on Lenovo store tonight. .."
Lenovo Thinkpad,the multitouch and privacy is tempting
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hopefully by mid june appear
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Higher nits important.
I use my t495s for indoor presentation is manageable but once I bring to trade shows, outdoor etc
it's still very dim at max brightness

Lenovo Thinkpad,In Russian but most people bought this specs
Lenovo Thinkpad,stupid question.. when is multitouch useful??
Lenovo Thinkpad,"sometimes its really just easy to touch compared to moving the mouse.
This is something that after you use after awhile than u will find it useful.
Requires you to switch your workflow and muscle memory."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I find touch screen and multi touch to be essential. Especially when i read Journal in PDF. something its better to just pinch to zoom. Often i just carry my laptop without a mouse so touch screen is just a bonus that i need.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I used to carry a mouse but then I graduated from having a mouse. I think i can survive w/o a mouse as long as the trackpad is good. So if that's the case , multitouch will be a good add-on?
But recently when I WFH, I went back to keyboard + mouse because I have an ext kb. But I think I'm ok w/o a mouse"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Multitouch is important if u use ur laptop to read newspaper, magazine, books and etc"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I'm using the spectre x360 from 2016, that why i was hoping for the AMD Envy x360. So reliant on touch screen and portrait mode to read Journal and coding
Cant believe until HP decide to chop carrot with us
. I pity those who aren't well informed about the old AMD CPU that bought the machine. I'm considering Lenovo Flex 5 but their screen is not sRGB... any other machine anyone can recommend?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hp isn't cheating anyone... The envy model you are talking about has been sold in stores for many months now. I guess it's the first time they are selling the 16gb model on their official store so they call it new launch.
Wait a month or two and probably the new Envy x360 will launch here"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Same with Asus Sg, SG market get leftovers and take very long to come."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Whoever interested in Lenovo laptop, shoback increased it's cashbacks from 5% to 12% only for today I think"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, upsized shopback only today"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Oh youre right. I found an old HWZ news, 12 July 2019, the current HP Envy x360 has being out for a few months almost a year. But why the new launch?
.So should also expect around July for the 4000 series. Damn... still got hope. If by August still not out yet i really must jump ship liao. School term starting and my current spectre battery and occasional BSOD really bugging me."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lenovo now has Ideapad and E-series which users can configure online, not bad. Don see HP, Acer have this self-config option."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hi guys! Newbie here, I've been lurking on this thread for quite sometime now. I found this thread informative.
I just want to ask if someone here ordered at Lenovo site a Legion laptop and got a free xbox? Did you receive a confirmation e-mail about the free xbox or it is included on the confirmation e-mail of the laptop?
Today I ordered a Legion amd and asked a rep if the promo for the free xbox is still ongoing and he said ""yes still have"". So I finally pulled the trigger and get the Legion Amd. After purchase, I only get the confirmation e-mail regarding the laptop but no info for my free xbox. Anyone can share their experience ordering at lenovo site? This is my first time ordering to them.

This is order/configuration on my Legion. I used thankyou code to get a 15% discout."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hey all who ordered last week. Have u all received the estimated shipping date. Mine is 19Jun
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ordered mine on the 24th of May and received today. Haven't done much with it yet except opening it up to slot in another SSD. It does comes with a dummy SATA HDD cage and the SATA connector. Removing the cage and the connector reveals the 2nd NVME slot. The slot is slightly raised so double sided NVME will be ok. Not sure about the main slot as I did not touch that.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"cool, 2 weeks !"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Not sure if the combinations of the specs affected the speed of the delivery. I believe it was estimating the delivery time to be between 4 to 6 weeks. When I swapped the graphics card to the 1650TI it went down to just 4 weeks.
Lenovo Thinkpad,so total there are 2 m2 slots? one from factory and the other slot being m2 or sata?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"that's very fast
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I opted for the 256GB 2280 SSD.
The intention was to swap it out with a 512GB 2280 SSD but since there's another slot there so I just kept the 256GB in and slot in the other SSD. The other slot is definitely NVME and not the SATA one."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"disc code: LIMITEDTIME
just chat with CSO for latest disc code."
Lenovo Thinkpad,thought THANKYOU has better disc
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The CSO mention we only get a email confirmation regarding the Xbox, when our laptop is delivered to us."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Funny , lenovo send me a email to repurchase as the previous did not went thru. No idea why but i go back to shopback and make another transaction with today 12% cashback .
So now i purchase at $1313.10 - 12% shopback total $1155.53
but my shipping went to 6-8 weeks intial was 4-6 i guess too much deman.
Tml need to call bank and check if they double charge me yet"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ordered on 31 May, seems to have shipped with estimated date on 9th June. Way ahead of the 6-8 weeks mentioned.
Btw, anyone has issues with shopback? Seems like my cash back wasn't tracked. Submitted an appeal but no news yet."

if you don't mind the rather business look."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeah I got the cashback.
There was a prompt on my Google Chrome browser saying Cashback activated or something when I landed on Lenovo site via Shopback site."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Mine still shows June 19 shipping. Deliver by 25 June. I think I ordered earlier than you by a few days.
Well personally, if received within 3-4 weeks not bad la.. at least not 6-8 weeks as stated."
Lenovo Thinkpad,how long did the cashback reflect ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,mine was originally that then changed to july lol...
Lenovo Thinkpad,mine took afew hours
Lenovo Thinkpad,"tat fast ! maybe is weekend now , shall see on monday"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Teardown!
Lenovo Thinkpad,definately one of the better amd laptop

Lenovo Thinkpad,"if got touch screen doesn't mean we need to have turn the laptop around right?
a lot of premium because of this feature?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is this different?
Lenovo Thinkpad,it's #4614
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yea thinking of buying 32gb kit to own Self install
Lenovo Thinkpad,"JUst to check, if I wanna buy the WWAN, is it too late if I already have the laptop?
X395 user."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you didn't configure it with WWAN when ordering, it's unlikely that the antennae are built-in. Not impossible to then get them, but you'll have to disassemble the laptop to install the antennae, since they are usually mounted next to the screen. And of course buy the WWAN card and slot it in. No issue for this portion."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Already more then 2 days from shopback no response. Send them a ticket and they told me I did click the link but not capture. Send them my order Id and sale order. They will investigate
.  Maybe after all the 12% might be too good to be true

Lenovo Thinkpad,Woohoo looks like laptop will be shipped out next week.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Possible for amd 4700u with mx350 configuration soon? Right now don't think I have seen any amd laptops with nvidia graphics in sg.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"unlikely they will pair this combo.
since the 4700u already got gpu equivalent to a mx150/mx250.
putting a mx350 is bo hua.
hoping we see a 4800 u with 1660TI
now that would be pretty interesting."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you are talking about the AMD 3rd gen ryzen.. then yeah I also don't see many AMD gaming laptops in 2019...
the 4th gen 4000H and U series is different.
For 4000U... Probably only Asus Zenbook might have the option to add a mx350
Other than that... the rest of the lineups are mainly ultraportable with integrated Vega
For 4000H we have more options...
There's Lenovo legion 5 is AMD + Nvidia gtx
Asus Zephyrus G15
Hopefully we will see Dell G5 15 and land in Singapore too AMD processor + AMD Graphics
I also looking forward to the new Acer nitro 5 with AMD + Nvidia rtx
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Mx350 is still a lot faster than mx150. Rather have the extra leg room for gpu
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ah... I think I have the same problem. Only record click activity but not transaction
Lenovo Thinkpad,"New Zenbook is with mx350.
."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"10W version leh, this gpu already entry enough still cut down might as well not be there."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Still better than igpu even if only by a bit, still better than nothing. Not like without dgpu price will be cheaper anyway."
Lenovo Thinkpad,">> SO it it minimally need to be >300 then is 'ho say' ?
Nit picking
Brightness is important for mobile devices like laptops, smartphones, and tablets. Most devices have a glossy display to enhance contrast, but the gloss makes reflections an issue in bright rooms or outdoors. These reflections can only be defeated by a bright display.
The nit is the standard unit of luminance used to describe various sources of light. A higher rating means a brighter display. Displays for laptops and mobile devices are usually between 200 and 300 nits on average. A rating over 300 nits is solid and a rating above 500 nits is extremely good. Only a few devices can put out that much light, though as HDR and OLED laptops become more common, thats changing.
Apples MacBooks are known for having the brightest screens on a laptop. Its 13-inch MacBook Pro we reviewed had a screen that maxed out at 548 nits. Televisions are a different story, and the brightest go north of 1,000 nits."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wont the it be distracting for the bottom part to be 10-15% dimmer. Using it in max brightness then you see the bottom part dimmer will be weird.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"indeed there is... but issit worth it?
Like the article said.. losing 20-30 percent of performance ..
if you really need gaming prowess.. get a laptop with 1660ti or 1650ti.
g14 or razer stealth better option?
hopefully someone reviews the mechrevo one..
that one is certainly interesting... wonder if can match mx350 ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"can consider this
6gb rtx 2060"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"this all oem, so just wait for local brand."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"1660ti laptops are like 2x the weight. Laptops at 1.2kg are all thermally restricted which affects the performance, you have to get premium models to have better thermal management."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you willing to pay a premium, definately not 2x and thermals will do better?
otherwise ya.. i agree asus mx350 will fit your budget and requirements
still i digress, waiting for T14"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For g14, dont buy from Asus Sg as its overly inflated. Importing it is significantly cheaper, plus asus has international warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,yea agreed.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"to have a dedicated graphics for an ultrabook like Asus Zenbook is a huge bonus.
many ultrabooks don't have dedicated graphics. even if they have its either mx150 or mx250
for the price of a Zenbook + mx350 and you are just gonna leave it at home....
imo can already go for amd gaming laptop like lenovo Legion 5"
Lenovo Thinkpad,lenovo got international ma?????
Lenovo Thinkpad,Cheap cheap 599usd nia plus 77 dollars shipping. Ryzen 4500U
Lenovo Thinkpad,This one is full plastic body? no chance of getting electrical shock then
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Sharing this 18% discount code LENOVO18 that I found which I just used for a legion 5.
Might be for the month of June."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Depends on individual.
If it is within my budget and light weight, I dun mind. If i want to play graphic intensive game, it will be on my desktop. My Laptop is to travel with me... light and good price."
Lenovo Thinkpad,seems like lenovo xiaoxin is quite good
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wah tempted but I'm worried that there's no international warranty.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"There isn't any.
And for the price of Rmb 4999 about 1K SGD it is nearly impossible find a online retailer that have stock.
This is one of the two SG version
Price wise will probably not be comparable to the Tiong version whenIF they arrive.
Alternative will be the Yoga Slim 7, but based on psref lenovo, SG will not get the 4800U version of Yoga Slim 7."

Lenovo Thinkpad,Better use GIVINGUP as soon as you can. The excessive usage of this premium code have been flagged Out to the management ... it is only matter of time 😭
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wouldnt management prefer higher sales. Discounts not their money anyway and it helps their kpi.
Lenovo Thinkpad,How do you know this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Both Intel and AMD uses Microsoft USB 3.0 driver that comes with
Windows 8.1/10.
Only Windows 7 than need to install USB 3.0 driver since Win 7
doesn't support USB 3.0 natively.
Could be OS corrupted or malware, if you know how to reinstall OS
than try first.
If after OS is reinstall and same thing than it is motherboard issue."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"anyhow pomp.
pls la, you think  discounts can be given till they make a loss?
all this pre-agreed upon.
and the larger the number of orders, the bigger the discounts, cos they save on shipping and bulk orders.
brainless is one thing...spreading false inform is worse."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For one, I didnt mention using the promo code will incur loss for Lenovo. Thats your assumption.
For two, how do you even know this is pre-agreed upon on ? Thats again your assumption.
For three, well, spread false information? How do you tell an information is false ? Are you a Lenovo staff ? Else just shut your assumption and your mouth.
And lastly, I am definitely not a Lenovo staff but I do have friend working under Lenovo sales.
Brainless is for those people who assume much.
Retarded."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lenovo can keep all the stock to themselves if they think they can sell a lots lots of unit without any sales with a graphic card that is a generation behind. We are helping them to clear their old stock, especially true when it comes to gaming!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I wont disagree with this! And indeed without the promo codes, Lenovo wont be able to sell as much quantities as they like to right now."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"and there is not reason to limit the screen options compared to intel same version, unless they get a bigger cut selling intel version.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"For #2
When a business runs a promo campaign, usually the projected revenue and number of units to be sold is all done and agreed upon with stocks allocated for.
So either this is wrong info being spread around or lame marketing gimmick to create sense of urgency for customers to quickly commit."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"1 selling at cost 0 profit better than loss. and that's what they usually do to prevent further loss
2 selling at loss on the hardware and overselling support is a common way they recover think of printers and cartridges. they sell printers at a huge loss and make back from the ink"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lazada got MSI GF65 with RTX2060 selling for $800. Possible???
Lenovo Thinkpad,"unlikely?
got link?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wrong info.. ?
Go try out GIVINGUP now and tell me whats the % of discount.
Btw, wanna know why GIVINGUP got flagged out to management? Think back why I did emphasis AGENT ID is extremely important"
Lenovo Thinkpad,i try givingup now only get 5%. did i miss the train?
Lenovo Thinkpad,I think you're extremely rude to call someone retard when you yourself sound so retarded. the cost of manufacturing is usually 1/4 of the retail price and the rest of unit profit. Of course there marketing etc that they need to cover. The discount is one part of the marketing. Also how do you even know this was flagged? Stop spreading false information.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"And it is not rude to call someone brainless out of no where? How do I even know the promo code was flagged out? Lol.
Sir, please kindly scroll up and read carefully.
And why are you talking about marketing and manufacturing cost now? You are completely out of context right now! Obviously promo codes are part of the marketing but it is limited for selective customers. When the system receive excessive order of customers using the exclusive code without the agent ID, this is a clear sign that this exclusive code have been leaked to the public. Thats when the management decide to remove the discount %.
And btw, did you even try out the promo code GIVINGUP before commenting about false information ?
Look guys, my message here is clear. There Are exclusive codes around, but you need to obtain directly from the agentprovided he is willing to give you. I provided internal news that the promo code will be restricted soon so do purchase ASAP But instead of anything I am being called waste of time, brainless by some of the adults here. Sure, so be it."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If true, then you told us after the code is flagged. What's the point? Just leave it and end the argument.
Someone said it's 1 month promo, now it's actually fake?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Well, why should i listen to you when you sound so retarded and aggressive in the first place. And yet you have not answer the question. So what if it agent id, do you work at shopback?
At least be a little considerate."
Lenovo Thinkpad,LOL. No one ask you to listen to me. I am posting my internal news from Lenovo. No one force you to believe whatever I say. But please do let me know how will you feel And react when someone call you brainless.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Definitely not me who said it is a 1 month promo.
The point is to use the code ASAP before the % are cut or removed. Is it so hard to tell ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Promotion code GIVINGUP is useless now. I plan to log order on tomorrow, but likely buy ASUS A15 now. Bye bye Lenovo."
Lenovo Thinkpad,When you tell us the promo is no more. Kong jiao wei.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Look for seller eunms898.
New seller. No rating yet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Kong your head.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ks1991 is correct. GIVINGUP discount went from 25% to 5%. I still hope 25% will resurface sometime tomorrow, but hope is low.
I should bought the Legion on yesterday, but late, haha!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Pm me. Let me help you.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Many fake sellers. Be very careful.
I have seen many accounts banned and reappear. Shopback, shopback1, shopback2.
It can never happen and it will never happen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Calm down guys, Ks was just trying to inform others that the 25% code was ending soon as there were some who were planning to wait for the higher cashback tomorrow. Turned out what he said was indeed true.
For those who are about to buy, just note that if you choose 2 SSDs, the battery indeed becomes 80wh instead of 60wh. The CSO told me it was a bug but turned out what he said wasn't true. 1 SSD + dummy/HDD will make it 60wh.
I tried appealing for my shopback cash back but was unsuccessful in the end btw. The click was registered but not the purchase itself."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is it too late to cancel the order and reorder again ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It only means the allocated stocks or projected number of units to be moved for this campaign under this promo code has been reached. Nothing more.

so ks1991 25% code +12% shopback = 37% off!!! mtl sub 1k gaming laptop with graphics card"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Its at the bottom of one page. Saying cso id optional. Cant recall which page. I did keyin the id number but price no different.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Order placed. Thanks to ks1991 for the code. Really appreciate it. First time use Shopback too. Hopefully will get the extra 12% off.
Delivery however shows more than 8 weeks. Guess too many orders to fulfil."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Does the 12% shopback work together with the 25% discount promo? So total discount is 37% off total price?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I keyed in Rep ID box. Not sure correct or not. Ya no price different.
Bro Yusoff confirmed both work together. Keep my fingers cross."
Lenovo Thinkpad,So the cons for this Legion 5 is that it cannot be charged with USB C right?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Any idea if there is a minimum spending for both promos to work?
Lenovo Thinkpad,No USB C charging.
Lenovo Thinkpad,u will get within 2h
Lenovo Thinkpad,May I know how much did you spent?
Lenovo Thinkpad,yay more people in the legion family haha. anybody planning to self upgrade to 32gb ram?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you are not doing video editing or 3D, no point upgrading."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Rep ID is needed else CS will email you to check where did you get the code from.. and the transaction might be voided. 😎
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lenovo pissing around with soldered RAM on current Thinkpads are the reason holding me back from ever buying a new one. It is simply bullsh*t for the T490s/X390 and all their AMD variants to have all-soldered RAM when Dell's 7300 has
TWO
replaceable RAM slots.
It looks like my only path is to upgrade from T460s to T480s. Or hope when Dell/Lenovo finally get their act together and release a 16:10 laptop with at least 1 RAM slot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"So i keyed in REP ID is correct? When i check order status, it show:
""Your order is currently on hold due to credit issue, please check your mailbox or contact
for further details.""
Is it due to verifying of credit card? I saw the $1 thing when making payment."
Lenovo Thinkpad,takes 2h to process.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Standard stage.. will take some time to clear

Gtx1650 and 1650Ti is really for normal indie games or some light esports title."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"congrats
i see that you have 80wh battery too"
Lenovo Thinkpad,yea have been following this thread n opted to add the 2nd nvme to get 80wh battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Very confusing leh. cso i spoke to say need Monday to confirm if xbox is available. so i hold my brake.
Lenovo Thinkpad,not sure why got dbl standard but i emailed the transcript to myself just incase they chut stunt.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"if cso dare to promise u got xbox
make sure you email and cc yourself for dispute in future"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"end of day, if lenovo came back and say no more, and i kick up a fuss, it may mean the cso kenna or fork the difference. like some say, no point breaking another rice bowl"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Type LENOVO18 and not Lenovo18. There are better discount out there for today only.
Lenovo Thinkpad,quite true also maybe cso just promise so that you can make the purchase asap
Lenovo Thinkpad,"actually, they have a lot of Xbox, not just 50. Over the last few days one CSO tell me last one, u order now, i reserve for you! Today one just confirm got many, sure no problem.
They are clearing for the next gen console coming in Nov, so no scared no stock.
If u can sell the Xbox off at 300 bucks, u actually exceed the 25% discount.
No one was giving me any codes, so i was halfway through creating one that is 1515 dollars  similar to yours  because with that, u get 12% shopback off 1515 dollars = $ 181.
If you use credit card 1.5% rebate = $22.75
Sell xbox = off $300 of cse, involve some risk and effort
End up 1515 - 22.75- 300-181 = $1011
Vs 25% off + shopback code 12% off a 1.8K ish price which will be = $ 1200
Of cse, if u add up to 2K config, with 25% off still exceeding 1.5K, u will get an xbox u can still sell off also.
anyway, end up i just ask the CSO nicely can give me 25% code or not,  they ask me if i am a frontline worker, which i am, and they give me a 25% code anyway."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Provided can sell xbox for 300 la
If ps4 no doubt.
Xbox maybe"
Lenovo Thinkpad,xbox is only available if u purchase legion laptop ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,waiting for Ultrabooks...
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ya only legion free xbox
Lenovo Thinkpad,Dell G5 15 SE with AMD Ryzen 7 4800H records above 100 °C average CPU temperatures leaving the Asus TUF Gaming A15 as the better Ryzen 4000 gaming laptop option
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, only for any Legion Laptop that final cost $1500 and above."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Legion vs asus tuf which one better?
Lenovo Thinkpad,so far reddit says lenovo not crossing 80 deg while asus is doing 90+ right
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think Legion is better in design and cooling. The ""borrowed"" ThinkPad functions are going in the right direction."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not very sure, but Asus TUF A15 has better specifications than Legion 15 AMD. However, Legion has lelong sales today and free xbox."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Asus Tuf has poor ventilation design. Just go for the Legion. Has anyone tried Mathematica and Matlab, does it have compatibility issue? It will be my first time going AMD, but still contemplating. Stupid question i know but i just want ease of mind first before i commit."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"When I watched Dave Lee review, I also noticed that the bottom edge of the screen is blocking the entire exhaust outlet.

please look for punita the customer service officer. she was the one that helped me with the xbox one s"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Nice one. If you can sell your xbox for $300, your laptop will super value buy at $1,680.98 - $300 - $193.65 = $1,187.33
$1,187.33 for Legion 15 laptop with AMD Ryzen 7 4800H Processor, 16GB DDR4 3200MHz ram, 2 sets of 512GB M.2 and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650. No online vendor can match this price.
By the way, I got my Legion laptop price at $1303.67 - shopback $150.18 = $1153 49
My laptop specification is AMD Ryzen 7 4800H Processor, 16GB DDR4 3200MHz ram, 1 sets of 512GB M.2 and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650Ti."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"you forget to get one more ssd for 80wh battery?
can ask cso help u change"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If it's UPS, it will go to Shenzhen hub before coming to SG. I ever had parcels bound for Malaysia from SG travel to Shenzhen then fly to Malaysia."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I'm ok with 60wh battery, I have a spare Samsung SSD and will add it to the new laptop."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Malaysia Lenovo does not have warranty in Singapore.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"About 1k SGD 16GB Ram 512GB SSD
KYM?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"No warranty in Singapore. If the laptop reach you with faulty part, how are you going to deal with that?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If really want a cheaper laptop than Singapore local set, you can research and check out Asus in Malaysia when border reopen after Covid19. Most Asus laptop in Malaysia has international warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Return and they will send replacement.
not a big deal right?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hello guys. keen to purchase a lenovo thinkpad. this is my first time purchasing, appreciate your patience in explaining to me.
i've been seeing the comments on the discount and vouchers code. I would like to ask
1 where are you guys getting the vouchers and discount code?
2 how are you guys placing your orders? is it online direct through the website? how do you all link from/through shopback?
3 between T495 and E495, which do you recommend? Are the chassis material in the T495 far superior than E495?
thank you!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"voucher ask from cso
shopback give additional discount by thru their clicks
T series is better than E"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yeap this is true. Ask the CSO for either student discount or xbox discount
Lenovo Thinkpad,"actually this is a very good time to buy ryzen laptops.
they are priced lower than intel and yield better performance."
Lenovo Thinkpad,answered.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"1 where are you guys getting the vouchers and discount code?
-> Follow this chatgroup or chat with lenovo CSO right bottom chat
2 how are you guys placing your orders? is it online direct through the website? how do you all link from/through shopback?
-> It is no brainer to use shopback. Go to shopback website, register.
Search for lenovo and click the the link to direct you to lenovo website.
3 between T495 and E495, which do you recommend? Are the chassis material in the T495 far superior than E495?
-> T series is higher model. Sorry cannot advise on this."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Open dispute and need to pay to return, not worth right?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Your package is being processed at the clearance agency. Can't wait tmr!!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You waited how long?
I am excited for the delivery too. But not shipped out yet"
Lenovo Thinkpad,31 may bro. early order i believe quite a few bros here ordered before 6 june all getting theirs tmr same shipment out
Lenovo Thinkpad,Wait now im confused. T495 is using the latest AMD Ryzen 4000 series? how come Lenovo website still show 3000 series chip?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Not the latest for sure 🤣
Lenovo Thinkpad,they will be t14/t14s AMD variant
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You will have to wait for the successor, which is the T14/T14s series"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"any release date for the t14/t14s series and their supposed prices?
might hold off getting the t495 for the latest."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Can i ask why you are looking for T14 specifically because there will a couple new models released from lenovo with amd ryzen?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Haha yea I just collected a legion backpack if I ever need to bring it out
Lenovo Thinkpad,GIVINGUP code change to 5% already..try to ask cso for a better discount..
Lenovo Thinkpad,I think should be ok with Admin ba! You are asking someone whether are they interested to take over the new purchase with no profit.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not working for 25%. You have miss the last train and need to wait for another.
You can use LENOVO18 for 18% discount."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I always liked Thinkpad series for their keyboard, robustness and overall feel to it.
I have never owned one, but I was familiar with it as I have sold their laptops before. I really liked them. That was slightly more than 10 years ago, where X61 was the latest and it was still under IBM. Back then it was crazy expensive and I told myself when I grow up, i would like to own 1 for myself. At that point no need for me to buy it as I was hardcore gamer heavily into custom desktops and custom gaming desktops was cheaper for value and bang for buck spent.
Fast forward to today, currently working, no longer into PC gaming. Life responsibilities dictates that I play with excel spreadsheets instead of virtual swords and shield.
So here am I, buying a laptop and fulfilling what I want to do 10 years ago.
TL;DR - personal preference for thinkpad series."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"keyboard wise... I only like Thinkpad and the new keyboard on MBP 16"" Well... its back to the old type
I won't say that thinkpad is the most comfortable but at least I feel the performance, key travel and feedback is one of the most consistent."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeap. i agree, i enjoyed the feedback and key travel although i pretty much prefer the keyboards on thinkpads on X220 and before. those are the true traditional keys."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"is there a greater discount thats already default on lenovo website?
Because i tried to checkout at cart and applied the code, LENOVO18, the price went up instead.
Did i miss something?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Different base price verses with different Promo codes.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thinkpad series, especially T and X series are very well built to last, i have been using them for many years in office. However, they are not gamer grade laptop, less upgrade option and can be very expensive."
Lenovo Thinkpad,I use it on Legion model and it really discount 18%.

Other brands are offering 1660ti for that price point although is exported set.
Nonetheless, Glad to enjoy the discount As i do not need a high end gpu.
Entry level 1650 16gb ram ryzen5 at a sub 1k sgd price tag is very attractive!"

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Agree with you, I seldom play AAA games nowadays and do not need a powerful GPU. A sub $1.1k laptop with AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB ram, 512GB M.2 and 1650Ti is good enough for me. Super happy with the purchase and waiting for delivery."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"question; on spec page, screen choice is 120hz 250 nits 45% gamut vs 60hz 300 nits 100% gamut
however, on psref
it is mentioned as 144hz 300 nits 100% gamut
can those who chose ""60hz"", check if they got 144hz instead? thx
and, just to double-confirm, only if choose 2 hdd [or ssd], then the battery will be 80wh config?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,You only need to input a rep ID if you had obtained a code from a Lenovo sales rep/cso.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Only 2x m2 nvme ssd then will get 80wh
The larger battery will eat away the 2.5 inch sata hdd slot"

Lenovo Thinkpad,Oh ya also upgrade ur lenovo vantage the one which come originally has some bugs. Backlit keyboard also got bug with fn and space button.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ya, agree with you that 1650 really is neither here or there. However, it is pricing that matters, and I seldom play AAA games.
I was considering this $1.1k model vs Asus A15 1660ti at $1.5k from Amazon. In the end, I decide to save by getting a cheaper one with better 2 years warranty."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"if you think the 1660ti is worth the $400 upgrade from 1650 then just go for it.
everyone have their own budget"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Or wait for amd model to have 1660ti, likely to be only $200 upgrade"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Unlikely. From gtx1650 to Ti already $100. Gtx1660Ti is so close to rtx2060 and is a leap in performance of almost 30%. They will charge at least $400 for it. There are some intel based gaming laptop from lenovo from gtx1650 to rtx2060 asking for $450 top up. Lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,"1650 to 2060 $450 is a good deal.
For Legion, 1650 to Ti is actually $60+ for the ones who used Shopback18 + cashback"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"That's true
Usually is green blue.

for under 2k... looks like solid buy"

Normally delivery in 2 weeks. Approximately end june or early july from 14 June"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Please remember to purchase the $36 onsite 2 year warranty.
Better to be safe than sorry"
Lenovo Thinkpad,It's normal Lenovo. They need to improve their delivery timing significantly.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"1Y deport mean you need to bring the laptop to service centre when spoilt, and go again to collect it after repair. The warranty is 1 year.
After the $30+ upgrade, lenovo will send engineer  down to to your home for repair on next working day after you report issue, and warranty is 2 years. This is a better coverage."

Lenovo Thinkpad,errr. how to check if got xbox even though laptop above 1.5k?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Must try.
Most customer will try to email them to get their order prioritised .. and that will push your delivery date backwards if you didnt request.. as such this will turn out yours Order become less prioritised while those that Did emailed Got their order prioritised."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks bro for the advice.

Lenovo Thinkpad,Is the xbox one s free gift still available
Lenovo Thinkpad,"the option is great but .... but at 144hz, the gpu 1650TI...
abit underwhelming."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Need 2060 more suitable for 144hz
Lenovo Thinkpad,top up ~$180 for 144Hz screen and 1650Ti worth? casual gaming and mostly use for school/office work.
Lenovo Thinkpad,How much will that be in total ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Not at all. Should even consider other laptops for that work flow. 1650 is neither here nor there gpu. Those buying legion 5 now is due to the cpu needs.
Lenovo Thinkpad,No. U need two nvme ssd to gwt 80wh battery.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Honestly 1650 and 1650ti is just a 5% fps difference.
Are you willing to pay for it?
Channel the fund to boost ram or ssd seems like a good value
Or even upgrade to ryzen 7"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Next 144hz on 1650 1080p?
Gpu Not capable I feel"
Lenovo Thinkpad,sian no satki ultrabook
Lenovo Thinkpad,G14 Asus but quite expensive. Rtx 2060 and only 1.6kg + 10hrs battery
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You get about 30% increase in graphics performance for paying additional $100.
School and office work dies not matter whether it's a 60Hz or 144Hz screen. You can also add a bit more, get a gaming monitor on top of the $180."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"30%? Must be old benchmark, newer 1650 now comes with gddr6 so smaller gap between both models"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I see, then it must be 10% or less only."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Serious gamers would look away from legion 5 15 AMD
And look towards Legion 17i or even the new Razer premium
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Or legion 5 with intel as it has 1660/2060. Gaming wise, gpu matter significantly more than cpu"
Lenovo Thinkpad,serious gamer should use wired LAN and desktop instead of laptop
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ryzen>Nvidia?
Discuss"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Some people need mobility
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Is it possible because I was on wireless thats why 4K video on YouTube seemed choppy? Or its not WiFi related, more like iGPU/GPU related?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"GTX1650 to Ti version assuming both GDDR6.. actual FPS gain is 5-15% only. The more intensive the game GPU wise, the lesser the gains.
Cost diff is around SGD $60-70, in Legion 5 context, after applying discount code."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Those getting the Xbox.
FYI, it is a 2TB version with 1 controller. I just confirmed with lenovo. i save the conversation too"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Usually if its choppy, it would be your iGPU/DGPU issue. If its internet issue, it'll buff instead of being choppy"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ur one is 4600H or 4800H?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Those getting Legion. Please ask the Customer Service officer if the xbox deal is still on and available. Some CSO say have. some say dont have. If you need the CSO name that serve me and said have, please PM me. I cant give the name here to protect the person's privacy."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Is there still the requirement of spending above or equal 1.5k dollars after discount is applied on the lenovo laptop in order to get the xbox one s?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"From the website I saw, the Xbox is only applicable to the first 50 people who purchased above $1500 legion laptop in a single receipt. Did anybody see this too?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"They say that it must be 1500 after discount wor then can get xbox.
Can i ask if they will send the xbox together or??

I also doubt its WiFi problem.

Lenovo Thinkpad,R7 4800H GTX1650 Ti and 16GB RAM
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can try with lan cable
Lenovo Thinkpad,Early batch of g14 had chrome hardware acceleration issue that causes black screen. Maybe its just another bug of amd and hardware acceleration.
Lenovo Thinkpad,seems like got alot. my friend order today also have. he saved the convo with cso
Lenovo Thinkpad,"But isit claim from xbox or they will send over with the laptop?

Lenovo Thinkpad,xbox will be sent separately according to the cso serving me. and yes need to spend above 1500
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For me is firefox.
I stopped using chrome altogether"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"according to my cso, lenovo will send"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Is there anyway I can ""force"" Windows to use the Nvidia GPU even when not playing games?
Like on youtube/desktop apps/etc"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I turned off Hardware Acceleration on Chrome.. and 4K video played very smoothly
R7 4800H ftw.. Vega gfx.. not so"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Need to go bios settings
Lenovo Thinkpad,sorry noob question. why must force ah? it's not auto meh?
Lenovo Thinkpad,HP Envy x360 AMD 4000 series in HP webpage. Hopefully i can get this laptop before August
Lenovo Thinkpad,Amd 4000 is giving intel a big challenge
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I heard that for ryzen, if it's 8gb ram, only about 4gb is usable because the rest is reserved ram. Like that still better than intel if im not using it for gaming?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,The new Ryzen 4800h hp omen 15 seems good.
Lenovo Thinkpad,This is what AMD has been doing for the past 2 years
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This only happens if you use the integrated gpu that comes with the intel/amd cpu because igpu don't have virtual memory aka vram
Igpu will treat the system memory aka your physical ram as its virtual memory"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Always go for 16gb of ram in 2020.
Unless you doing basic work then 8gb"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I feel that A lot of premium laptops and more premium parts are still intel

For those who are interested, 1650ti will not run well on AAA games, better choose 1660ti or 2060 GPU for AAA games, but it will not be cheap. The cheapest 1660ti laptop is $1.5k+ Asus TUF A15 sold by Amazon US, some say very good, some say heat issue, some say cheapest in Singapore or Batam.... Lol!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"A15 need to turn off turbo boost to regulate the heat.
Asus screw up the thermals for a valued 999usd laptop. Too bad"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Legion 5 do not have any issue with thermals for now. Even at max load only hitting 80C CPU
Lenovo Thinkpad,I bought the laptop due to the CPU and design only. I am willing to pay more if they have premium built amd laptop.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My final 2 choices are $1150 Legion 15 AMD or $1.5k+ Asus A15. In the end, I get Legion cause it is $400 cheaper with better thermals. I seldom play AAA games nowadays due to work and home commitments, so 1650ti is good enough for me. I still playing Age of Mythology nowadays. LOL"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I still play cs1.6 occasionally. Which even vega igpu works

Lenovo Thinkpad,"With a maximum white level of 343 cd/m2 and a black level of 0.309 cd/m2, the display used by Legion 5 offers an excellent contrast, over 1000:1. Color reproduction and uniformity are also stellar, with the average Delta E deviation having a value of only 0.79. Gamers and professionals alike can use this display, for both purposes."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"In terms of battery life, Lenovo Legion 5 15ARH05 has good performance, providing over 9 hours of work, 4 hours of intensive work or 3 hours of gaming away from the socket. It is not an ultra-portable and we cannot expect the same numbers, but overall you can work for a quite a while away from the power outlet."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"the cooling system used by Lenovo is a bit quieter, with the meter recording 41.3 dB, compared to the 44.5 dB reached by the Asus model, so this difference could easily be turned in Lenovos favor with a more aggresive fan profile. However, it is possible that this is only a characteristic of the sample we used for testing, and retail versions actually do have a more aggressive fan profile."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Its kinda funny they got the 144hz screen yet the gpu is weaker.
Maybe its a prelude to the 1660ti or 2060 option?
I hope they do.
T495 also seems unable to buy, hope its a sign T14 amd is here"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Got listing for AMD CPUs available for T14/T15 already?

Lenovo Thinkpad,Found for Y9000x only. Will it fit on legion 5???
Lenovo Thinkpad,Bro share link where to get this please. i need to protect this gem

Lenovo Thinkpad,Price cannot challenge legion 5
Lenovo Thinkpad,order the cooskin one
Lenovo Thinkpad,1.5k is expensive
Lenovo Thinkpad,any idea how much to top up?
Lenovo Thinkpad,No details atm.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My guess, from 1650, top up to 1660ti will need $250, top up to 2060 will be $400."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"choose
2020款拯救者R7000】银粒子抗菌键盘膜
for some special antibacterial silver thingy hahahaha"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes cannot challenge... But legion 5 is different league from envy x360.
The guy told me will be the 400 nits display and WiFi 6 model"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"4500u for ultrabook only 6c6t but 15w
4600h is 6c12t at 45w"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hp envy series ultrabook the display is quite good.
wifi 6 nth special"
Lenovo Thinkpad,you ordered from ezbuy?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Frankly speaking, if top up 1650 to 2060 need $400. I might as well get 1650 and spend additional to buy Sony PS5 right."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Bro is it exactly this product or which one? i see so many option but no legion 5
Lenovo Thinkpad,"but ps5 this year i am guessing it will cost 1000 sgd
if spend 1k to buy a game console
i rather build a ryzen desktop"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Dell G5 15 SE 2020 performance
Stacked within the belly of the Dell G5 15 SE, is an AMD Ryzen R7 4800H processor with 16GB of RAM, which easily tore through 40 Google Chrome tabs and five 1080p YouTube videos while Assassin’s Creed Odyssey ran in the background.
On the Geekbench 4.3 overall performance test, the Dell G5 15 SE nailed 29,253, which soared over the 21,322 mainstream gaming laptop average. It crushed the Intel Core i7-9750H in the Omen 15 19,956 and Legion Y545 23,868, but the Ryzen 9 4900HS in the Zephyrus G14 30,181 killed the G5 15.
The Dell G5 15 SE transcoded a 4K video to 1080p in 6 minutes and 43 seconds on our HandBrake benchmark, sailing past the category average 10:35. It not only surpassed the Omen 15 12:34 and Legion Y545 8:51, but also topped the Zephyrus G14 6:59.
Dell’s 512GB SSD copied 4.97GB of data in 12.4 seconds, translating to 410 megabytes per second, which is just under the 467-MBps mainstream gaming laptop average. The Legion Y545’s 128GB SSD hit a slow 189 MBps, whereas the 512GB SSD in the Omen 15 and the 1TB SSD in Zephyrus G14 nailed 728 MBps and 1,131 MBps, respectively.
Dell G5 15 SE 2020 battery life
The Dell G5 15 SE has some of the longest battery life we’ve seen in a gaming laptop. Surprise, surprise, it’s all thanks to AMD. After it continuously surfed the web over Wi-Fi at 150 nits of brightness, the G5 15's battery lasted 7 hours and 14 minutes, which crushed the 4:50 mainstream gaming laptop average. The Omen 15 3:05 and Legion Y545 3:38 were basically dead on arrival, while the only competitor left standing was the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 11:32, which can also thank AMD."
Lenovo Thinkpad,yeah nothing special but some models of the x360 come with realtek wifi5. Deal-breaker if the sg version comes with wifi5
Lenovo Thinkpad,"firstly you need a router with wifi 6 ax capabilities.
then you need to have a good fibre speed.
if cannot fulfill both condition then quite pointless
wifi 5 ac will suffice"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"choose 2020款拯救者R7000】银粒子抗菌键盘膜 if u want with silver particles anti bacterial.
in china our model is called r7000"
Lenovo Thinkpad,edit: found a few other seller of this product...5 dollar for the high end one before shipping....after shipping alone its 10 dollar same as ezbuy unless u consolidate with other items
Lenovo Thinkpad,"T ohbiang leh.....
not lifestyle"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Nice. thank you captain
Lenovo Thinkpad,"can teach me if should go 6c or 8c.
Also 8 and 16T too. Is core or thread significant?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,What app do you use to test this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Those bench mark are not by me.
From professional  reviewers"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Threads are very important as core
Depends on your use case"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The cost difference is not a lot, but you will feel the performance difference when you need that extra bit of processing power. Get 8C 16T 4800H for future proof."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Those of yall who ordered legion 5 last week, is the current eta earlier than the 8 weeks as stated when ordered?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I have gigabit fibre with AX88U. Plus laptop will use for 3 to 5 years... Might as well get the latest now if possible.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Under 2 weeks delivery.
Unless no stock for parts"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Definitely go for wifi 6 in your case!
Nice asus router btw"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If your budget allows... Go for ryzen 7 or ryzen 9 like 4800U, 4800H, 4900H, 4900HS
The difference in performance is huge between ryzen 5 & 7
Furthermore, the upgrade cost between ryzen 5 & 7 is like $100
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"cores perform better than threads tho..
8/8 performs better than 4/8"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I dont sit in Starbucks even before CB so looks is the least of my concern
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For me i do not need 8c16t computing power.
I rather spend the $100 on ssd or ram.
But i must say the pricing is very tempting.
I shall not chase technology blindly.
I shall spend within my limits"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"For me.. i max out cpu ram
Probably should be able to serve me well for 5 years
I chose 256gb SSD cuz I don't download much content... Nowadays almost everything is streamed
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I order on 14 June, expected to deliver to me in 6 July. Have emailed CS 2 times but no reply. Sad!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Depends on your usage, nobody knows it better than you. Personally, my work requirement is more core more thread more RAM more SSD the better"
Lenovo Thinkpad,i think i should buy 1 more ax router lol...i got 2gb internet but only using 1gb
Lenovo Thinkpad,"leaving shanghai now
should be in korea tomorrow morning"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think I need either 8/8-47U or 8/16-48U.
Not sure how the threads works...core means more ppl working on it la"
Lenovo Thinkpad,For laptop just get a higher end processor and ram since cannot upgrade easily..
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You serious boh or just trolling?
If you need an analogy using people, each core is like a worker but the worker can be dumb one, only know how to do one thing at a time. Some workers smarter can use both hands and do two things at the same time.
The first one is no thread enabled while the second worker is thread enabled and ideally can do twice as much work as the first type of worker.
However, some type of work may require two hands in the first place so both types of worker end up no difference for this type of work.
So ideally 4C/8T can appear like a 8C/8T CPU but for some types of work load, the 8C/8T can be much faster."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ryzen 7 4800H is definitely a good upgrade from Ryzen 5 in terms of performance if you are in for gaming or video editing.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"gaming i dont think so. 4 core is sufficient for now. unless future game dev increase the core count. but with lousy 1650 will become the bottleneck in future
video edit definitely improve the rendering time with respect to core count"
Lenovo Thinkpad,long story short.. just hoot the bugger  4800u ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I personally think that those who buy Legion 5 without upgrading to Ryzen 7 4800H is wasted, this processor can last us for many years as it is so advance and powerful.
Getting a good processor laptop is importance if you plan to use it for a long time. My 10 years old first generation i7 Lenovo ideapad Y550P laptop is unable to play any AAA games now, but it still work wonder after upgrade to 8GB Ram and SSD. I can run Zoom, multiple Chrome and office, play some light games on the same time and it boot up within 5 seconds."
Lenovo Thinkpad,wa your laptop lasted 10years
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes, I purposely spend more to get i7 so that it can last.
Interesting, those who want to see my 10 years old i7 laptop can refer to this review.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Remove mouse, headset and backpack. Keep the 2 years warranty."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Shipping company operate in such a way that they need a consolidation hub. They dont work like on demand where they send from the shipper to the addressee direct. They need volume to ship. Cant be 1 parcel from china straight to singapore.
So they all go through a consolidation hub. Where all the rest of the world items come in to consolidation hub and redistribute to the destination of country.
So they will consolidate all the shipment that is going to singapore then load up and leave.
If they cant get volume, they will then send in to another consolidation hub. Thats why you see some of your shipment from china go korea then back to china. Which means that in korea they dont have enough load to load up the plane to travel back to sg.
They will not ship a half or 3/4 empty plane."

Lenovo Thinkpad,wa now order a legion 5 need 8 weeks to ship
Lenovo Thinkpad,Buy laptop get free xbox why not
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Dont really like their service. Ordered a HP laptop for my family. In the end accuse me of abusing voucher. When the voucher clearly states that to buy $900 worth of items and get $100 off. Didnt even state must be laptop.
So i bought a Hp laptop and additional warranty and mouse and bag + antivirus. Waited 5 days. Then reject my purchase.
Msg them and they say not happy go find lazada. Ask lazada then they claimed that cannot. They refuse to honour.
Few weeks back, my friend wanted the model you posted. In shopee mentioned that buy this during flash deal and get delivered next day. So she ordered. And the next day they say cannot commit. Cannot commit nvm. Still say no stocks. No stocks then still flash deal. Furthermore ask her to take intel 8th gen laptop of a lower value and throw in free microsoft office. Not happy complain to shopee ask for refund.
The attitude really bad."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"That's like Jovie Chew's way of doing business. Thank you for the information, will take note of this shop."

performance at 1.38GHz is about a ryzen 2500u"
Lenovo Thinkpad,can share how to limit cpu
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Received mine today. Ran Cinebench R20. For reference my 2015 Razer Blade 4720HQ gets around 1200pts.
This beast got 4400-4500pts on performance mode with no dips on multiple runs plus it is quieterlower pitch fan noise than my Razer Blade, peak temp 92c on the CPU.
Will be using it mostly for photo/video editing. Love the keyboard and build quality especially for the price. But i might be tempted if they release a 2060 version since Premiere Pro just got updated and supports NVENC exports.
I also like the Lenovo Vantage application for the battery conservation mode, i usually leave the laptop plugged in and conservation mode doesn't fully charge the battery to reduce battery degradation."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Base on what I read from Ultrabook review website... Legion 5 is able to go up to RTX 2060,  up to 64GB ram 2 x 32gb and paired with 144hz screen

Lenovo Thinkpad,4800U KYM?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Lenovo customised specs for AMD really CMI. Usually companies don't know what consumers want. This is so true.
Lenovo Thinkpad,this the s540 13are?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Not bad for 15w cpu perform better than 45w 4600H
Lenovo Thinkpad,Of course it is.
Lenovo Thinkpad,advanced power option
Lenovo Thinkpad,How do you wish to limit the cpu? Turn off boosting?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Luck of draw,
The one i've gotten came with the Samsung PM981a and the best 2.5K QHD panel out of the 4 currently used by lenovo for this model."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"under power options > advanced power option > switchable graphics > if force power savings when on battery
The laptop uses amd apu instead of nvidia. uses 18w when gaming and fan doesn't blow hot air"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I play the same game. The 4800H and GTX1650 Ti gives me constant 60 FPS I limit it on 1080P but in wvw or world boss events it drops to 30-45.. which is still darn good for an unoptimised game.
My desktop i5-6500 and GTX1070 gives 20-25 FPS in same scenario.. but its running 1440P ultra widescreen."
Lenovo Thinkpad,How did you buy this?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you all using Lenovo Vantage software. I believe you all can control performance or windows power profile.
If you really want a very cool cpu under gaming load. Best is to disable boost mode. This will run 4800H at 2.9Ghz on all cores during gaming. It will be negligible performance impact on games. You will be amazed by the temperature.
Go to registry edit
HKEY LOCAL MACHINE
System
Current control set
Control
Power
Power Settings
5453325
be337238 > right click attributes or under attributes left click modify set value to 2
Go to power plan
Change advanced power settings
Disable processor boost mode under processor performance boost mode.
For me i disable for both plugged in and battery.
When u set at Lenovo Vantage into performance mode, your boost mode will go back to 4.3Ghz.
If u set windows power profile mode, you should be in disable boost mode.
When gaming. When u at windows power profile mode, your cpu will be capped. But you trade it for massive drop in temperature but very minimal impact performance for gaming. 1% at most."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"18k for 4800u .
Where you bought yours
Can sic
Posted with Nokia 8310 HardwareZone Forums app"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can share how you ship over to sg? I tried to buy a laptop from Jd but don't have suitable CC
Lenovo Thinkpad,How long did it take to be delivered to you? Bought the 14 inch model from jd as well and received an email to pay the custom tax
Lenovo Thinkpad,can share how to buy from Jd?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"got usbc better, can use a smaller block for charging"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"is that a 1080p screen? 300nits?
so what is total landing price inclusive gst ?
I think it's like around $1100 ? cheap compared to Legion 5?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,should be QHD 2.5K panel.
Lenovo Thinkpad,I used a china card. When i was making payment i saw that they accepted international payment though i did not try a non-china card before
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Not sure what you mean by suitable CC.
Bought using mastercard.
There is no need for 3rd party forwarder when buying from official flagship stores on platforms for example JD.
They will ship direct to your designated address.
Similar to ""shipped/sold by newegg"" or ""shipped/sold by amazon""
The CSO actually called up for confirmation due to the purchase might incur GST."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Spec of the notebook

total landing price inclusive GST SGD 1101.27."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"thanks for the info.. enjoy your lappy.
btw, perhaps can review when you're free.
can tahan don't bring adaptor to work ma  use battery  ?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"You are welcomed.
The battery should last more than 8 hours on balanced power profile.
Official reviews put the numbers closer to 11 hours.
GAN PD chargers are 1/2 the size and weight of the included power adapter which serves as excellent alternative for frequent travellers.
Do not think it is advisable to bring personal notebooks for work.
This notebook is also suitable for females as it weighs only 1.26kg and only the size of an A4 paper."
Lenovo Thinkpad,will this model brought into singapore?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Wow I see. I guess it only applies to certain items. I tried to buy the UX425 from JD but it wouldn't let me checkout to Singapore. When I put a China forwarding address, it would only let me link to a Chinese bank account on payment."
Lenovo Thinkpad,bro gian already ah? you didn't hoot legion 5 rite?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"From the 2 displays what is the diff, one is low power?
WOW metal case
So there is 1 usb-a and 2 usb-c . i think it has 1 more 1 usb-a slot as compared to my Yoga Slim.
I think it's a good buy a good buy 1,100.
Do you mind to PM the URL? Thanks"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Holy sheet, like that no point buying laptop from Singapore sia. So much cheaper even with GST.
Do note the two Type C on the S540/Xiaoxin are Gen 1 only"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If purchase from JD, means no warranty?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Yeah I guess need to ship back to China yourself. That is the only risk ba. Cos you may end up with dead pixels all those if you are unlucky
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Eventually it will come.
But looking at the price of a particular local reseller listing a lower tier model,
I'm pretty sure this notebook will not come cheap when it start selling in SG.
These are the prices in CN.

Currently there is a shortage, may be due to insufficient components such as the NVME SSD.
The SG version should comes with 1TB NVME SSD.
NOTE: This notebook can only be equipped with single sided NVME SSD if you intend to swap out or upgrade."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"very good price
got international warranty?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,The USB C ports seems to be able to support 4K 60Hz output according to this review
Lenovo Thinkpad,Ship back to China for warranty if you bought it elsewhere.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yup DP thru type C should be able to support 4k. Question is whether it's displayport 1.4, which can then support up to 3x 4k 60hz over one cable"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Deleted. Post in wrong forum
Lenovo Thinkpad,you can always buy from the usa and ship back sg
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Do not buy the wrong one, JD will auto revert to a item base on availability and Geo-location.
in this case, your link is correct, this is the lenovo official flagship store, but the notebook is out of stock, the selection automatically refer to last year's model."
Lenovo Thinkpad,so actually is it only speed difference since it has PD charging and display?
Lenovo Thinkpad,Maybe should take a look at how much JD is selling for this model and why now many people are avoiding this variant.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Haha, JD is selling how much for the same specifications?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"KYM

Rumour:
Tiagong, A particular A coy made a complain to another A coy saying another coy not playing fair by secretly increasing their line of 4800H TDP beyond 54watt. In the end their own line of products came under scrutiny for bad design with overheating problems.
tiagong only...."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Interesting story. Any link to read? There are only 2 Axxx company. Easily guess.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Apple and Aftershock? Hahaha.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yup, there are actually 4 different panel vendors for this notebook as well as 2 Nvme SSD vendors, SamsungPM981a and WD black SN730.
it is full metal case finish. Back lacks HDMI output.
For people who want to make comparison for the different models, can refer to the below: only in Mandarin"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Acer could be offended by my statement:
Alienware could be offended by my statement?
Apple could be offended by my statement?
AMD could be offended by my statement?
Asrock could be offended by my statement?
Asus could be offended by my statement?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,You forget to add Aftershock.
Lenovo Thinkpad,Nice that is quite fast. Was it easy to change from Chinese OS to English OS?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Only Tier manufacturers could afford to make the complain.
They have all the leverages.
Resellers have better know their place less making a whimper might not even have the stocks allocated for them to make any sales."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Format and reinstall. 20mins affair.
I have to forgo the included authentic MS office.
99.9% of notebooks sold in CN have a variant of Windows 10 chinese version meant only for their market.
There is a slight difference from the windows 10 used by the rest of the world.
One does not simply change the language from chinese to EN."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can reuse the same licence? Heard need to have own code
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Vid of someone using a PD charger while playing game ""simple games""
note the glossy screen"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Very nice, still can play GTA somemore.
Do you guys know any other brand name laptops that can ship from JD? seems like latest envy x360 and Asus restricted from shipping to sg"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yes there are times where by the flagship stores themselves do not want to entertain overseas purchases for certain batches of goods.
same when as you go into newegg US or amazon US when the item added in the cart ""disappear"" after changing location to SG.
the same thing happens for this first batch of S540-13ARE when it was initially launched.
The JD website will show ""this item is not supported for sale in your region""
I was lucky to camp the site when the 3rd batch release to able to select SG as my shipping destination.
Now the price of this notebook has increased and worse...no more stocks after reviews came out."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"For those who are interested
Just received my Flex 5 16GB RAM 1TBSSD Ryzen 4700 today. UPS timing was 9pm but received around 5pm.
Lead time 1 month exact - re-ordered on 25th May
Total damage $1000 nett after shopback, discount code and credit card rebates
Primary purpose of the Flex 5 for me is for work, presentations and e-signing of documents.
Overall, really satisfied with the build quality and performance. Touchpen accuracy is fantastic. Hinges are solid during tablet and tent mode. The screen however, is pretty lacking did my research prior so within expectations Can't really discern red and orange, so for those doing video editing do look elsewhere
Excellent product for me, price point wise!"
Lenovo Thinkpad,I don't think this model or it's variants are available for sale in CN
Lenovo Thinkpad,That was a pretty good deal you've gotten.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"So difference is slim bigger battery, FHD screen but 14""  does it mean it's the taller vertical type ?  and micro-sd"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Whats this shop back thing everyone is talking about?
Quite satisfied with ideapad 5 1Tb 4700u build and quality.
Deal wasnt as great but they did gave another 5% discount due to delay shipment from 2 weeks to roughly 6 weeks Probably my initial discount code at 12% wasnt that high to begin with."

3. They take like 2-4 biz days to reply between each email. Dragged for a week I bueh tahan call them then I was getting faster responses afterward so I recommend calling really.

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Optimizing for lifespan years Battery longevity is affected by age, the number of charge cycles, amount of time at full charge, and high temperature. For maximum lifespan when rarely using the battery, set Custom charge thresholds to start charging at 40% capacity and stop at 50%, and keep the ThinkPad cool. The thresholds can be adjusted in the Battery Maintenance settings of Lenovo Power Manager. If the battery is used somewhat frequently, set the start threshold at around 85% and stop at 90%. This will still give a good lifespan benefit over keeping the battery charged to 100%. The simplest way to optimize battery lifespan is to select Automatic in the Power Manager Battery Maintenance settings, and let the power manager manage the battery charge thresholds."

Reply: We will send out 50 Xbox to the 1st 50 customers who buy this item at over 1500 SGD price after 7% GST. Our marketing team will reach you if you are one of the lucky first 50 customers.
Qsn: Asked if I was one of the 50 :
Reply : Sorry, we have no access to find this out, our marketing team will reach out to the qualified customers  after the order is delivered successfully."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Whoa they chut so many pattern one. Luckily i saved the chat log of the customer service staff that mentioned I am entitled to the xbox one straightaway without the ""one of the lucky first 50 customers. """
Lenovo Thinkpad,May I know how do you remove the bloatware?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Was your shopback cashback tracked after you made your payment? How long was it before you are notified of the rejection? Got use any promo codes when checking out at lenovo online?
Asking cos my cashback is shown as tracked currently, with no futher updates.."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Looks promising... The version coming to Singapore should have similar specs
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Mine only Click activity clicked. My transaction was not recorded so I reported missing cashback. I received my order and report missing cashback with updated info.
Shopback stated that - Lenovo 'deemed my order did not arise from Shopback'.
CSO helped me quote order using SHOPBACK20 after it expired. Maybe because the T&C ' Use only promo codes featured on ShopBack'."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Lucky you. Sibei sian. Pattern more than badminton, no transparency with the promotion. I checked another CSO after my order, say Promotion still on-going after I made my order. Sadly, forget to SS. Now need to play waiting game. Don't know how to contact the marketing department.
Please update here if you received an email from their 'Marketing Department'.
Fell prey to their promotional deal. I push to 1.5k really shoot myself in the foot."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"That sucks. Lenovo products are good but their customer service and their promotions always have a lot of hidden T&Cs. Much more than other companies.
For their live chat, I think its heng suay.. it depends on who you are talking to. Some are very stingy and make their replies very ambiguous."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hope his saved chat will work in the event they say he is not in the first 50. Later they say their decision is final and there is no way to change it even though their CSO says otherwise lol
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Hais, do whatever they can to hit sales target bah
. Too bad I on the receiving end"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Yeah....after you make order, talk to CSO no use already, they won the battle and convinced you to buy. Please proceed to contact sgcs@lenovo, the backend team for any enquiries on your existing orders. Next round of badminton"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Most likely they will choose either
A buyers with the largest single-receipt purchase or
B buyers who don't use discount coupons or
C buyers with the least discounts

Lenovo Thinkpad,Still don't know why it took hp this long... They are going to lose a very potential customer  cus I need one soon in 2 weeks time. If not i will just go for the new Fujitsu UH-X

Lenovo Thinkpad,"guys, for ultrabooks . are they meant to max speed for long hours or burst.
I was crunching numbers for more than an hour. it kinda throttled at around 2200 vs 3000+ bursts. is it normal?
will renoir be able to sustain?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,best denki guys showed me the brochure Liao..coming in mid to end july
Lenovo Thinkpad,Does Fujitsu UH-X have AMD version?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"It's normal, ultrabooks are meant to be thin but with that comes limited cooling capabilities.
For Renoir it depends on the implementation of the cooling system.
Like for eg. see the complaints on the net about the Asus TUF."
Lenovo Thinkpad,No. I was referring to the HP Envy. The uh-x is overpriced imo for its specs... Comet lake and no thunderbolt 3...
Lenovo Thinkpad,"That's the only issue with AMD
No TB3
this is kinda exclusive only to Intel. This is one area Intel is super strong
They are able to get suppliers to, willingly be tied down to Intel

Lenovo Thinkpad,"What i really need is to run python, matlab and linux, report writing, maybe some light gaming and watching anime, so i see mobility is the most important. i can forfeit the tb3 to be honest.
On the sidenote, aftershock just announce an AMD laptop"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Hopefully it by mid-july ba. If not really gonna get UH-X  by then. Was really entice by the 778g and made in japan. .... expensive but at least i trust the security and quality.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Try to go for Ryzen 7 or Ryzen 7 Pro if budget allows.

Is their ""ups my choice"" free? Is it good?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,So much better than adding Singpost. Singpost is a national disgrace. The delivery guy just leave a note and left without knocking on my door. I was waiting for the whole morning. What a waste of time.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Thanks. There are many useless bloatware in default Windows that used up resources. May I know can we choose which bloatware to remove, as I want to keep some of them, such as Sticky Notes?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"with Similar Spec with Lenovo Legion 5
4800H, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD

Lenovo Legion 5
4800H, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD
+ 60Mhz Screen
+ 1650 Ti
= $1,550 before cash back + xbox
Is it worth $400?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,Mentioned before. From 1650Ti to Rtx2060 is about a $400 jump. That is the performance you are paying for.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The list:
3DBuilder, Appconnector, Bing Finance, Bing News, Bing Sports, Bing Weather, Fresh Paint, Get started, Microsoft Office Hub, Microsoft Solitaire Collection, Microsoft Sticky Notes, OneNote, OneConnect, People, Skype for Desktop, Alarms, Camera, Maps, Phone, SoundRecorder, XboxApp, Zune Music, Zune Video, Windows communications apps, Minecraft, PowerBI, Network Speed Test, Phone, Messaging, Office Sway, OneConnect, Windows Feedback Hub, Bing Food And Drink, Bing Travel, Bing Health And Fitness, Windows Reading List, Twitter, Pandora, Flipboard, Shazam, CandyCrush, CandyCrushSoda, King apps, iHeartRadio, Netflix, DrawboardPDF, PicsArt-PhotoStudio, FarmVille 2 Country Escape, TuneInRadio, Asphalt8, NYT Crossword, CyberLink MediaSuite Essentials, Facebook, Royal Revolt 2, Caesars Slots Free Casino, March of Empires, Phototastic Collage, Autodesk SketchBook, Duolingo, EclipseManager, ActiproSoftware, BioEnrollment, Windows Feedback, Xbox Game CallableUI, Xbox Identity Provider, and ContactSupport.
You can reinstall again the sticky notes."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Maybe lenovo Legion 5 will be cheaper
If you got a 144hz screen, 2060 and 1660TI if u willing to lower your graphics, are your only options."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Can i remove this manually?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Also Lenovo got brand also good after sales service

Lenovo Thinkpad,Can manually delete just Google it.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"My new Legion 5 has only 1 set of 512mb m.2 disk. If I add ssd to the empty second disk slot, will it void the warranty?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"SSD, HDD and RAM are supposed to be user replaceable parts. So warranty should not be voided"
Lenovo Thinkpad,No. They just wont warranty the parts u change. So say you put in ssd. They just dont warranty that ssd loh. The rest will still be intact.
Lenovo Thinkpad,So should I get the Aftershock Apex 15R Lite or wait for Legion 5 to come out with a 2060 option? I need the 2060 graphics.   Am not sure whether Lenovo will issue a 2060 Legion 5 model in SG.  Then again also concerned about the small 47W battery in the Apex - surely the batt will die very quickly even when not gaming?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"What models are we waiting for thinkpad 14 inch with AMD 4000 series?
Is it T14 , T14s? Any idea when release in Singapore?
Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"If you have spare cash, Asus G14 with 2060 is a good option."
Lenovo Thinkpad,i heard there is cooling problem with Asus model
Lenovo Thinkpad,yes... with a 2060... 47w will definately die fast
Lenovo Thinkpad,"E14, E15, T14, T14s
The intel versions are all out..
Other countries like korea and NZ has started selling or shipping some models.
We still no sound"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"The model that has cooling problem is Asus TUF A15, G14 is ok."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I guess our market too small, or our market don't really appreciate expensive laptops.
We always last to get and even when come, specs are lousy and expensive"
Lenovo Thinkpad,What is this. Haven't even receive my laptop and i received an email on my warranty registered and started. Wtf
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Guys, I have some issue with the keyboard backlight. it seems like i can only on and off it on lenovo vantage but on keyboard, i can only off but cannot on. anyone got this problem?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"This is normal. You can ask them to update after delivery,  need to provide them proof."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"hahah sad...

Lenovo Thinkpad,thanks. I will try and update here if it works. the vantage update is in windows store is it?

Lenovo Thinkpad,dunno haha
Lenovo Thinkpad,Bought one from jd.com and their declared value for the laptop was about $50 higher using the current fx rate when they convert to sgd. Did you encounter the same thing?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"I think for customoversea shipping declaration, JD will use the official list price of the item value.
meaning the declared price will not include: when the item is under promotions, flash deals, pre launch sale, rebates etc.
Example, I bought a notebook listed as 4999 rmb flash deal, the official list price of the item is 5299 rmb, JD will declare item value as 5299 rmb conversion to destination currency when shipping."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"spec says up to 32GB so should be OK. The 32GB is what I am looking forward to.
That said, I've tested 32GB DIMM + 8GB soldered on my current T470 and it worked too despite not in the original spec."

Lenovo Thinkpad,"Ah ok that makes sense, bought mine during the promotion as well. I think all my future laptop shall be from China"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"So 8gb is enough? Or 16gb
Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"8GB is sufficient.
but of course, you need to look at what other software and tasks are you going to run on your laptop?
if T495 is your working laptop then having more ram doesn't hurt.
my t495s is my working laptop so I went for 16GB
2GB: Only really found in budget tablet designs. Fine for them, but youll want more in a laptop or desktop.
4GB: Entry-level memory that comes with even budget notebooks. Fine for basic Windows and Chrome OS usage.
8GB: Excellent for Windows and MacOS systems and entry-level gaming.
16GB: Ideal for professional work and more demanding games. With RAM prices so low, this is the sweet spot for desktop users.
32GB and beyond: Enthusiasts and purpose-built workstations only. Serious gamers, engineers, professional A/V editors, and similar types need to think about 32GB-64GB."
Lenovo Thinkpad,Just sharing right after bootup and launch 5 browser windows plus the following on a 16gb machine. In actual fact after running for quite awhile it's pretty near to 50% just for reference.
Lenovo Thinkpad,What's your point? Good or no good?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"In 2020 just go for 16gb la..
Save yrself headache."
Lenovo Thinkpad,There is a reason why I get 16gb.
Lenovo Thinkpad,"given the additional top up for another 8gb of ram is often less than $100, it is advisable to do so as you will be getting compatible ram with it + the warranty. really never know when you need that additional boost."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Starting at:
SG$1,199.00
inc. GST
E14..
but no models atm"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Please note for people getting the Renoir aka Ryzen mobile 4000 series notebooks with integrated graphics.
The system memory is also being shared as the GPU memory.
The GPU memory can be configured as 512MB usually default or 1GB,2GB/4GB. The system will also be able to allocate more system memory on demand beyond the user configurable of 4GB.
What this means is if the user is to configure say 4GB of the total system memory for the integrated GPU on a 16GB notebook, then the remaining memory left for OS and programs will be 12GB."

the intel driver was for my wireless or bluetooth; dunno whether its the one causing the problem. Anyway, when open device manager->audio output->my driver version same as holocast and also managed by AMD
I suspect the AMD kit driver update caused the problem because that's around the period i noticed something wrong with speaker and no other updates
tried this but volume level still same...i thought this setting is when u using microphone to speak during calls and it will reduce background noise..

apparently, it seems like Legion 5 is cheaper in Asia and more expensive in US and Europe According to the review video
My personal review of Legion 5 for the past two weeks.
Gaming:
1 As a casual gamer, I am very happy with it
2 When you first switch to [Red], do expect the fans to go full throttle when you first launch games or when you start playing. After a while, it will go away. I notice this whenever I was playing MOBA and MMO-FPS games. FPS is good.
3 The heat is mainly around the YUIOP area, so the WASD and space bar area is very cool even after gaming for hours
4 I managed to get around 5hrs of battery life while streaming Netflix 50% brightness + quiet mode
5 With most of the ports at the back, after you plug in the power, HDMI, lan cable etc, all the cables are ""blocked"" by the screen
6 The screen hinge allows you to open it with just one finger.
7 Audio is really good. the built-in mic is very sensitive and able to block out background noise. Furthermore, it supports Dolby Atmos® headphones... My friend came over last weekend to game together and I tried his Sony MDR-HW700DS headphones......
It was just WOW!
not-so-good
- people with big hands, you may not like the keyboard layout design as it needed to accommodate the numpad. So WASD keys is to the left.
- consider to lift the back of the laptop by just 1 to 3cm to improve air intake from the base.
- Heat is blowing out from the left and right side. your right hand will feel the warm air coming out from the right side after 20-30mins of gaming.
It would be more ideal if the heat do not come out from the right side. only the back and left side but.....oh well

Lenovo Thinkpad,can pm link? got choice to select FHD but 16:10 ?
Lenovo Thinkpad,great review!
Lenovo Thinkpad,"Could be placebo but seems louder.
no way to test
but i agree it could be the amd drivers that might be meddling with the sound.
though so far... its not a big inconvenience to me, just gotta change the volume slider range... instead of 30 now become 50?"
Lenovo Thinkpad,"i used to have it at 30, now need 100 to hear the same volume
tested on some youtube videos im familar with
really cmi
this kind of thing go warranty is sibei waste of time
good for u rah, 50 is still notch bad; can still adjust upwards"
Lenovo Thinkpad,is e495 a good laptop? i m interested bcos of its upgradebility and i on a lower budget.
Lenovo Thinkpad,What battery size ? 80wh?
Lenovo Thinkpad,"A4 sized, 1.26Kg, ideal for females."
Lenovo Thinkpad,"WOW! looks awesome!!!
apparently, it seems like Legion 5 is cheaper in Asia and more expensive in US and Europe According to the review video
My personal review of Legion 5 for the past two weeks.
Gaming:
1 As a casual gamer, I am very happy with it
2 When you first switch to [Red], do expect the fans to go full throttle when you first launch games or when you start playing. After a while, it will go away. I notice this whenever I was playing MOBA and MMO-FPS games. FPS is good.
3 The heat is mainly around the YUIOP area, so the WASD and space bar area is very cool even after gaming for hours
4 I managed to get around 5hrs of battery life while streaming Netflix 50% brightness + quiet mode
5 With most of the ports at the back, after you plug in the power, HDMI, lan cable etc, all the cables are ""blocked"" by the screen
6 The screen hinge allows you to open it with just one finger.
7 Audio is really good. the built-in mic is very sensitive and able to block out background noise. Furthermore, it supports Dolby Atmos® headphones... My friend came over last weekend to game together and I tried his Sony MDR-HW700DS headphones......
It was just WOW!
not-so-good
- people with big hands, you may not like the keyboard layout design as it needed to accommodate the numpad. So WASD keys is to the left.
- consider to lift the back of the laptop by just 1 to 3cm to improve air intake from the base.
- Heat is blowing out from the left and right side. your right hand will feel the warm air coming out from the right side after 20-30mins of gaming.
It would be more ideal if the heat do not come out from the right side. only the back and left side but.....oh well
- Wish that it was RTX 2060
- wish that we can up it to 32GB
- wish that I was given the option to select 144 Hz screen and 4-zone RGB keyboard"

mbp 16,SGD3999 with 16gb ddr4...
mbp 16,The news finally came. It was supposed to be last week because reviewers were under embargo... I thought it would be sooner than now.
mbp 16,When would it be available in Singapore
mbp 16,Tomorrow our time. It's stated in the newsroom today US time
mbp 16,"Should be soon. Though the website stated available for purchase today according to SG Apple Newsroom.

All Things  Pro on the HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,Whoa the $3999 model actually more worth it than last gen given that it gives a more powerful GPU and double the storage.
mbp 16,"I think overall the price points still maintain the same from the previous models and configurations.
All Things  Pro on the HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,"That’s very true

Who’s hooting? Sicssor keyboard is the game changer"
mbp 16,So far I prefer the butterfly keyboard.
mbp 16,Inverted T directional keys and PHYSICAL escape key!
mbp 16,Not really. The 16” has double the storage and GPU of Vega 20 level of last gen. Oh and faster RAM too.
mbp 16,Are you getting it?
mbp 16,"16gb is not good enough for video exporting, still refuse to bring back sd card slot too, kinda sad, also have to wait to see if overheating is still an issue."
mbp 16,Re-designed airflow.
mbp 16,"Still using my 2015 MBP with scissors mechanism keys. So far so good.
But lately spent a bit too much on Apple hardware so need to stop a while."
mbp 16,Will have to wait and see how effective.
mbp 16,"Guess I am holding off this one. Completely based on the keyboard alone.
At the most, I will consider the 2019 15"" one with the Butterfly mechanism."
mbp 16,May I ask what do you usually use MBP for?
mbp 16,Writing code.
mbp 16,Next year 14” should be a new design.
mbp 16,Feb/Mar 2020?
mbp 16,"More likely towards WWDC where new design for both 14” and 16” with 11th Gen and 10th Gen Processor respectively.
This 16” to me is just a stop gap."
mbp 16,"Don’t find the need at the moment as my 2013 MacBook Pro still serve me well.

As long as still supports the latest MacOS can already."
mbp 16,Hope it comes with scissor mechanism too! Cant wait!
mbp 16,those who bought the highest end 15inch for the past 5 months really bang wall
mbp 16,will wait for Intel 10th Gen CPU.
mbp 16,It will definitely.
mbp 16,Haha last one month still got reason to ask Apple for a return and get the 16” model.
mbp 16,It is stated in the announcement text.
mbp 16,"no keynote. but this is the closest we can get~
not sure what the dude did to get to talk to Phil Schiller. but good on him."
mbp 16,Oh they announced the 14 MacBook Pro already? Do you have a link for that? Cant seemed to find it
mbp 16,"Only 16 inch MacBook Pro and it comes with the scissors keyboard, but no news or new models on the 13 or 14 inch models.
All Things  Pro on the HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,"No no. Referring to the part you said you hope is scissors mechanism.
Sorry. I read wrongly earlier."
mbp 16,Any idea roughly when the preorder start ? I saw the news wrote today but doesnt seems like it
mbp 16,Maybe have to wait tomorrow 9am liao
mbp 16,us time i think?
mbp 16,"With the announcement of this, alot of good bargains in the refurbished section. Haha"
mbp 16,For example?
mbp 16,I just got my MacBook Pro 15” i9 1TB Vega 20 like 3 weeks ago. Planning to return and get the $3999 16” model. The performance gain should be at least 20%
mbp 16,I thought return only within 14 days?
mbp 16,Cannot return liao
mbp 16,"No worries bro, you got my hopes up haha! 😂"
mbp 16,Apple can always make an exception when there is a new product launch within a certain time frame.
mbp 16,"I wrote to Apple SG Press Relations.
They apologised for the confusion as the press release was changed from available today to coming soon. They just said keep an eye out on Apple.com/sg for availability."
mbp 16,"You just got the 13 right
Maybe can consider this
Bigger screen for productivity
But if u like portability just stick to 13"
mbp 16,"that’s very bad news
Thanks for letting us know"
mbp 16,Which config you getting? Max out ahh
mbp 16,"I think the 3999 model more worth leh

1tb and better gpu. Will be getting edu price also. Hopefully tmr morning can order"
mbp 16,Not upgrading to 32GB RAM or GPU to the 8GB model?
mbp 16,"That's annoying - I saw the original press release and have refreshed the store page a few times a day since then expecting them to be available. Looks like we are going to have to wait, although I wouldn't expect it to be longer than a week or two."
mbp 16,"Ya I prefer 13 size.
16 too big for me
Anyway I will be getting a refurb set and return my recent purchase. The refurb set has better specs in terms of cpu, ram, ssd, ports etc. FOR THE SAME PRICE!"
mbp 16,"The base 16-inch model is now available to order on apple.com/sg.
Try to configure a build-to-order model though, delivery goes to 02 Jan 2020, and then the MacBook disappears from your bag."
mbp 16,"Fully spec out Macbook 16 inch cost S$8,619"
mbp 16,"They've changed that already it seems, now any customization AT ALL makes 'shipping unavailable', so it seems right now it's base model only.
Anyone know if they have demo units at the store yet, I know they don't have them in-stock for delivery, but I'd like to see the thing before throwing $4k at it."
mbp 16,Even adding Final Cut to the base model makes it unavailable. I assume its a problem with the website.
mbp 16,"Your bag is empty.
anyways 32GB RAM config: S$4,059.00
sigh.. so expensive. will wait for reviews."
mbp 16,Overkill
mbp 16,"Just tried the 1tb, i9 processor and 8gb gpu option but nothing in cart"
mbp 16,base model available on 22-Nov. guess thats the same day it will be available for demo.
mbp 16,Usually MacBook Pro can last at least 5 years especially now that the keyboard is no longer the problematic butterfly one.
mbp 16,Cant seems to decide whether to go for the refurbished 15inch base model or wait for 16inch
mbp 16,"16 inch edu price

No need think"
mbp 16,Refurbished still save alot more but I just concern whether to risk with the butterfly switch hahaha
mbp 16,It comes with 4 years keyboard warranty.
mbp 16,"the butterfly keyboard is not for everyone.
i tried it. buttons seemed bigger.. but also flatter and closer to the frame.
and it's noisy.
did they take cue/reference from mechanical keyboard~?"
mbp 16,"Think they have already fixed the kb issues. Now is just a matter of taste and preference. I can’t stand the butterfly ones, have to rely on Bt keyboard and a laptop stand

16 inch price is about the same as the previous 15, and refurbished in few months should be the same as the price u r seeing for 15. Buying a 16 would mean better resale value in the future as well since majority dreaded the butterfly kb."
mbp 16,"yeah. then add Apple Care: S$549.00
jesus~"
mbp 16,"consider the improved thermal too, and reviewers have been saying that fans are quiet and not kicking in too much versus the previous 15.
And many more like the improved speakers, etc,.
value proposition is way higher"
mbp 16,I dont think can purchase leh. Does it need student id  verification?
mbp 16,Can purchase
mbp 16,It is showing available at Apple store on 25th nov
mbp 16,"can customized to 32GB RAM and add to bag liaoz.
Order today. Delivers on 22/11/2019 - 25/11/2019.
or should i wait for Intel 10th Gen~? i think mid or even Q1 2020 we should be seeing that refresh. ugh..."
mbp 16,It’s much cheaper than last gen which tops up at 4TB and 32GB of RAM.
mbp 16,Any one who went to Apple store yet? Are the MacBook up on the display?
mbp 16,Can buy from US. Some stores already discounted. More worth it.
mbp 16,Air freight would be expensive and GST at customs?
mbp 16,"And they give u US plug

Not so worth it la"
mbp 16,Whooo just arranged a return for my MBP 15”. Gonna get there 16” model next week!
mbp 16,US plug is more elegant bro haha
mbp 16,Not until when u plug into a protruding travel adapter
mbp 16,"My current 13"" 2015 model is an Australian plug. The design makes the plug very pointy."
mbp 16,I don’t really see the big deal with butterfly keyboard actually
mbp 16,Congrats! I think you will love the 16
mbp 16,Has anyone seen the new models at any of the two stores yet?
mbp 16,"Just came back from jewel apple store
Not yet"
mbp 16,Nope. Think 25th then have
mbp 16,Okay. Thanks guys.
mbp 16,a bit useless unless it can improve battery life~
mbp 16,So anyone here has one already?
mbp 16,"Funny is, it’s already on sales in the US."
mbp 16,Earliest for anyone to get in sg will be 22nd
mbp 16,base model can be picked up in store
mbp 16,"Yes, just checked. Can pick up today. The base model is already very powerful. I think more than enough for many people."
mbp 16,This or Alienware M15?
mbp 16,My goodnessssss
mbp 16,Went down to orchard Apple display set is up to try out
mbp 16,Just got my set
mbp 16,Congrats! The base model?
mbp 16,Yes just the base model is available. Gotta cancel my 1tb model
mbp 16,congrats! I just got the base model too
mbp 16,How does the keyboard feel? Scissors > butterfly for many folks. But Scissors 1mm travel ....
mbp 16,"I tried both scissors and butterfly, but scissors felt so much better than butterfly because of the tactile feedback"
mbp 16,Congrats all. Make me jealous and impulsive now. Hahahha
mbp 16,"Way better.

But the 16 like a bit too big and heavy when I try the 13 just now in store"
mbp 16,"Wait until 14” come out or my current MacBook Pro with Retina display cannot receive latest MacOS software then buy
16” too big for my liking.
Hopefully the escape key and the keyboard goes to next generation 13 or 14”
Both my MacBook Pro and MacBook Pro with Retina Display are 13”"
mbp 16,"This new 16"" revert of the keyboard to the 2015 design makes my 2015 model 'valuable' again."
mbp 16,Enjoying it
mbp 16,"Congrats bro and enjoy it to the max! I still can't justify upgrading my current mid 2015 15"" MBP as it's still going strong, battery still good so far.
Only thing, no touch bar."
mbp 16,"Tbh I rather they remove the Touch Bar.
Don’t find it intuitive.
Speaker does sound better. Keyboard tactile.
Hope to get used to the side"
mbp 16,"Was at Jewel and the new MBP 16 inch is also available. Wow, the keyboard does felt very solid. I kinda like it. In my opinion, the tactileness is much better/higher as compared to the 2016-2019. Shall try it later in the month/or next month and see how the keyboard wears out."
mbp 16,It’s better for you to upgrade to that 8GB GPU for just $140.
mbp 16,"All MBPs are awesome laptops. Perhaps because I don't own any MBP that have the touch bar, hence it's new to me. I've yet to try the keyboard, see how it compares to mine.
But I wished Apple brought back the illuminated Apple logo, because the 2015 model is the last one that has it."
mbp 16,"Went down to Apple to try the MacBook. The keyboard has convinced me to get it. It’s an in between my personal 2015 scissors one and my 2017 butterfly work one. I like it.
The Touch ID button now feels more like an on and off button.
I would have gotten the base model but here’s a question to you folks. Is 16GB suffice or at least 32GB for future proofing.
Upgrading from a 13” 2015 to 16” model now.
excited"
mbp 16,"really depend what u using it for
are u facing a lot of slow down on ur current setup? if photo/video editing, 32GB RAM would be recommended."
mbp 16,"I opt for 16gb because so far most programmes 8gb is more than enough unless you are doing heavy tasking like programming etc.. Compare to your 13"" 2015, is the ram enough for you?"
mbp 16,"8GB for the current. Definitely not enough. 16GB seems to be okay. 32GB will be future proof for the next 5 years+
Still deciding if it’s really worth to top up $504 for it."
mbp 16,"Heck, i find 8gb ram like quite taxing for my usual stuff
No hardcore processing by the way.
Just email, running 2 whatsapp, webpages etc
16gb should be the minimum"
mbp 16,Thanks for your contribution. Definitely helping me to decide for the 32GB at this rate.
mbp 16,"Saw it available in store. Couldn’t think straight

Think for my usage should be sufficient. Save some moolah. Got 2 weeks to play with. If really need an upgrade, can just return.
Very happy with the set. Gonna keep this for a quite awhile"
mbp 16,Yes this is the best MacBook Pro since the 2015 model haha
mbp 16,I dont do video editing but photo editing and 16GB is sufficient. If video maybe 32GB.
mbp 16,"Does anyone know when the 8core i9, 1TB model be available for buying in store?
It seems to be the most reasonably priced upgrade from base model, I have ever seen from Apple."
mbp 16,Should be $560 right?
mbp 16,"I am currently using a 8GB MacBook Pro 2017. Able to run Photoshop, WhatsApp, Xcode, Safari and Chrome all at the same time with no issue.  Just that compiling project not so fast but I think there is more to do with the processing power.
I feel 32GB necessary if you running 1-2 VMs in addition to your normal tasks. I am trying to convince myself to get the 16GB one.."
mbp 16,I thought it should be more or less the same from the base model after adding the upgrades?
mbp 16,"32GB for video, 16GB for photo editing.
no point having more if not using it much. unless the cost is not so huge for the Ram increase.  else 16GB really more than enuff."
mbp 16,I’m buying from education store. I got the legit documents to verify if they need it.
mbp 16,"I find 32GB RAM more for those who do intense graphical work, else 16GB is more than enough. 16GB now is also the norm too.
Posted with Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,Nah even 1-2 VMs is enough with 16GB RAM. It’s a Mac not a PC by the way.
mbp 16,You can’t upgrade to 2.3Ghz CPU from the base model so yeah the $3999 is priced reasonably.
mbp 16,Which VM did you test this with? Parallels or VMware Fusion?
mbp 16,"If you buy base model and add the cpu, gfx card and storage upgrades, it costs 4279$. So you save 280$ by buying the 3999$ model.
Anyway I have bought it today. This model is available in Apple store at Orchard. Got it in space grey.
My first Mac. Have upgraded from Surface Book 1."
mbp 16,"Yes cos you saved by not going to the 2.4Ghz CPU directly which is the only CPU the $3299 model able to upgrade to.
The 2.3Ghz CPU is only available for the $3999 model and to get that, you have to go with 1TB minimum.
Apple doesn’t allow you to go with 512GB with 2.3Ghz CPU. They are smart indeed with the config."
mbp 16,Personally I think Parallels is the best for the Mac. The integration is very seamless.
mbp 16,"Opening too much tabs on chrome browser would still warm up the MacBook

Shall try safari"
mbp 16,"Education price is $3209 for base model, shiok. Close to 8% discount, -$290
Posted from Hell B18 HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,Bruh don’t ever use chrome on a Mac. Use safari or Firefox if you want to watch 4K YouTube videos.
mbp 16,Thats nice.
mbp 16,The dilemma for 16GB or 32GB is real. First world problem.
mbp 16,"Yes got it for that price

Super worth it. Considering 2019 13’ 512gb is already about 2.8"
mbp 16,Video editor? If yes just 32gb with your eyes closed
mbp 16,Not doing anything in the media industry.
mbp 16,16gb
mbp 16,"For those bros who have bought the 16” MPA, how many of you went by installments or one shot charge full price to your cc? Or full cash
Posted from Hell B18 HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,Bro do you know if education price can pay via installments?
mbp 16,Can. I did check with the staff. Got to do online over chat.
mbp 16,Full to Cc. Don’t pay cash. Get some rebates or miles
mbp 16,Cash back heavy from POSB everyday card. One example.
mbp 16,Buy middle specs will do... after awhile come out new models again
mbp 16,Check out the review of the base model.
mbp 16,"Wrong. Buy what you need. If you need 64GB with 5500M 8GB 4TB SSD go for it.
Every year will have new release but MacBook generally can last unless you use it to earn a living.
6 months later will have a new MacBook Pro 16” with intel 10-gen processor and Wifi6. How do you keep up? It’s not a phone."
mbp 16,Impressive. Base graphics > Vega 20
mbp 16,Which is why I’m returning my i9 Vega 20 unit and swap to i9 5500M unit.
mbp 16,"I wonder how many of you guys are really using it to full potential, i.e, video processing / programming etc"
mbp 16,"I buy it to surf YouTube at Starbucks.
Wondering 16gb enough or not, or should I up to 32gb so I can watch 4K at Starbucks"
mbp 16,64GB. Watch 8K.
mbp 16,"That’s why my MacBook Pro use from 2013 until now never change.
Wait until cannot upgrade to latest Mac OS then change"
mbp 16,"Just went to try out the 16 MBP at Jewel Apple Store. Overall beautiful machine with gorgeous display, the scissors mechanisms tactile feedback also slightly different from my 2015 15 MBP.
Theres also a 2.4GHz 8-core i9 with 32GB RAM, 8GB 5500 graphics and 2TB SSD config, going for $5538 which is not stated in Apples website."
mbp 16,Yup a bit different
mbp 16,Perhaps mines the old type while this is the improved type.
mbp 16,The improved one seems to have less key travel.
mbp 16,"Most probably, but the tactile feedback is good. So far among the best."
mbp 16,I do prefer the lesser key travel. The 16” MacBook Pro has convinced me.
mbp 16,It’s available to order online too. You have to self build to this config. Same price $5538. This is the config most Pro will go with.
mbp 16,"But seems overkill for the average user, the $3999 config should suffice.
Posted with Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,Average users don’t even need 16” bro. Even the $3299 model is overkill.
mbp 16,"I find the $3299 one just OK. Some just want a larger screen, existing users of 15"" will find 13"" a 'downgrade'.
Posted with Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,Tested adobe. Smooth
mbp 16,"Ps? Lr?
Posted with Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,"Photoshop and illustrator

Just nice for my usage"
mbp 16,I guess it’s the 16GB one?
mbp 16,Yes he has gotten the $3299 base model.
mbp 16,"I'm using Ps and Lr but more on Lr. On my current machine already can manage well, so can imagine the 16""!
But only thing is, drain batt quite fast."
mbp 16,The base model looks attractive enough. Totally beaten the 2019 15-inch gao gal and again cheaper with so many improved features.
mbp 16,"Specs definitely better, but I find the base model should also use Core i9."
mbp 16,"Yes I was wondering why battery drain so fast

Hopefully not just me"
mbp 16,"Lightroom for example, uses quite a bit of RAM for editing photos and internal fan revs up and temperature goes up, hence draining the battery.
Every time I use Lightroom and spent over an hr or two editing photos, battery can drop to almost half."
mbp 16,Wow. You guys are all paying educational pricing ah. Everyone refer to the base model price as $3299.
mbp 16,They student we not
mbp 16,Maybe too used to iMac and MAC mini for the past 2-3 years. Seeing battery goes off is so unusual
mbp 16,"Haha....thats the difference between non-portable and portable, or should I say needed AC to run and battery powered.
Ive never used any desktop macs before, only MBPs and my current one is only the 2nd MBP Ive ever bought."
mbp 16,I always leave my adapter plugged in. Lower the cycle count.
mbp 16,"But wouldn't it stress the battery too?
Posted with Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,same here...
mbp 16,"I don’t know actually. I’ve tried many ways but this one works best.
I don’t know if Apple has a power management chip to cut supply off at 100% too."
mbp 16,Hmm even when you arent using it you still plug in the charger ?
mbp 16,Ya. I do that. I have no idea what other methods that works.
mbp 16,"It should have. My 2015 model bought since launch, but I always run via battery, low batt plug in to charge and unplug when full, then run on batt again.
Till now batt capacity still around 88%.
Posted with Samsung Galaxy Note10+ HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,"Officially gotten my MacBook Pro today. After thinking for so long, settled with the 16GB ram.

I really like the marketing image."
mbp 16,Anyone's customised mbp started shipping already?
mbp 16,"15/16 inch laptops may soon be the norm ardy
Posted from Hell B18 HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,So is good or bad??
mbp 16,Why do you think that way?
mbp 16,Why say so?
mbp 16,Is anyone battery health or design capacity not showing you got a lower battery health on coconutbattery?
mbp 16,"no good or bad, but when 16"" MBP starts popping up at Starbucks ppl may start to entertain the idea of buying such size laptops."
mbp 16,"Don’t think so

Not so portable for most students. The screen estate is great"
mbp 16,"15/16 inch laptops are too big to carry around
13/14 inch better, best is iPad size"
mbp 16,"I agree the 15/16"" is not so easy to carry around."
mbp 16,"I used to lug it out and sit at Starbucks to use it, now it has become a home computer."
mbp 16,"Guys, pretty sure this is not normal right?"
mbp 16,"Let me test on my set and get back
Edit:"
mbp 16,"I don't know what to do now. Going back to Apple Service won't work too if they detect battery is fine. Return this?
And yours so fast already 97.7%?"
mbp 16,"I presume its a new batt of course, give it a few cycles of charges to get it to optimum level."
mbp 16,"I cannot find anything regarding the 16"" Macbook Pro battery design capacity anywhere on the internet now."
mbp 16,"Okay, I'm charging it for the first time now."
mbp 16,Not sure if 97% is normal. Anyway do u guys experience audio cracking issues?
mbp 16,While changing audio or when audio stops? Yes.
mbp 16,Anyone knows where to get accessories such as a case for the MBP 16?
mbp 16,More problems found. My MacBook has no sensors according to iStats Menu?
mbp 16,Just return it. No need to explain. Get a new set n test
mbp 16,"Nvm. The sensor thing is the third-party software problem. People are raising the issue to the developers. I've downloaded the newer builds, it works now."
mbp 16,Wanna to get the $3499 and add to 1tb. But stock only available by 29/11.... so long 🥺
mbp 16,"Guy's anyone know if I'm a part-time student at a uni, can I still order from the education store? Seems like I can checkout normally until payment but when do they check if you're a student or not? Very good price on the education store for 1tb ssd + 32gb ram, tempted to get if they accept part-time students haha"
mbp 16,You can. They’ll do random audit. The chances are low.
mbp 16,"Definitely can. Even in store, just show ur student card and you’re good"
mbp 16,"Are you guys getting Apple Care+ for the MacBook Pro 16""?"
mbp 16,Upgrade specs better
mbp 16,AppleCare+ is a must on every MacBook.
mbp 16,Both my the MacBook Pro I own so far never buy any Apple care
mbp 16,So far anyone found any 16 sleeve or case yet ?
mbp 16,Wow. The Apple Care+ costs $549. Has it always been that expensive? I think the one for my iMac is less than $400.
mbp 16,It was AppleCare previously which cost around $300+. Now they change to AppleCare+ which covers accidental damage.
mbp 16,"I was quoted student price about 45x by the Apple staff. It is about 15% of the price of the base model
Maybe those getting higher end specs can consider"
mbp 16,Why do you have two MacBook Pro?
mbp 16,Just received tracking no. for shipment on sat
mbp 16,Bought the first one and 4 years later the MacBook Pro in already auto shut down. Went to repair was quoted logic board spoil so buy new one
mbp 16,"Not really. I never buy AppleCare for my MacBook Pro 13-inch 2017. Even after warranty, I still get battery replaced for free."
mbp 16,Oh I see. Why don’t just sell one. How are you going to use 2 anyway?
mbp 16,"Well you can choose not to buy. It’s your choice. But for Mac, it’s going to be a long term investment so AppleCare+ is critical given you can’t replace most of the parts yourself."
mbp 16,"Same here. I've owned a 2010 MBP and graphics dead by 2015, hence bought the 2015 model and still using it now. Both I've never bought any AppleCare."
mbp 16,Both are actually still available. Just that Apple Care+ needs to be purchased within 60 days while normal Apple Care can be within a year. The difference in price is just $20-30.
mbp 16,Does anyone know if AppleCare+ is a full refund after one day of use for returning the MacBook?
mbp 16,No one want to buy so just keep
mbp 16,True true. I don’t know how much can my 13” 2015 MacBook Pro fetch.
mbp 16,Full refund
mbp 16,Okay thanks.
mbp 16,Full refund even for more than 1 day. As long ur mac is returning within the 14 days
mbp 16,"Just got my 16 inch today at Apple Store. So far loving it, but the battery lifespan not as good as advertised leh. Keeps draining pretty fast, is this normal as it takes some time to be optimised?
Aside from that - the speakers are lovely.
Anyone knows whether any shop sells accessories like screen protector?"
mbp 16,I feel the same as u regarding battery life. W/o using adobe
mbp 16,You are returning the Macbook Pro alreadY?
mbp 16,First few days usually will drain more power due to the indexing process.
mbp 16,"Its normal
My first day with a mbp13”, the batt went from 100-0 in 4-5 hours. Hardly any usage. Just indexing and syncing with iCloud
Subsequently then ok"
mbp 16,"Ok thanks guys, that is more reassuring."
mbp 16,Update us again maybe 3 days later.
mbp 16,Did consider because next year is Face ID.
mbp 16,Not happening bruh
mbp 16,"Haha. I dropped the idea of returning already.
Got to stop with all the buyer’s remorse. Buy already and feel bad."
mbp 16,Wah. You want to return for a rumor? Minimum need to wait for one more year even if it is true. This version is very well received so dont they will be so keen to refresh it so quickly.
mbp 16,I just feel no point to return. This one is probably the most stable one since it’s design. Next design might come in a mess
mbp 16,"Agree. Just like the 2015 MacBook Pro which is their best and most stable iteration until 2016, they itchy finger, introduce the butterfly keyboard, Touch Bar etc. 😂"
mbp 16,I think the biggest value to upgrade from my 13” 2015 one is the Touch ID. It bought me so much convenience.
mbp 16,There will be a refresh definitely to the 10th Gen Intel Processor and more powerful GPU. Probably within the next 6 months.
mbp 16,"10th Intel Chip also comes with faster RAM speed..... which might also cost more~
but wifi6 is nice."
mbp 16,Next year 14” MacBook Pro
mbp 16,The bigger screen size should look amazing too.
mbp 16,"Got mine also MBP16, I think now is to start another thread for the accessories 😆"
mbp 16,Aka MacBook Pro dongle thread.
mbp 16,Mine not here opted for delivery which is slower yet but interested to see what sleeve can be used. Hopefully not too ex.
mbp 16,Base model? Or high spec version?
mbp 16,"I am thinking apple is going for the iPad strategies on MacBook for the time being.
MacBook Air being the cheapest macbook one can get. This is similar to the the basic iPad while you dun get all the best tech but allow you to have access to macbook at a cheaper starting price. As a contrast, MacBook Pro 13-inch is positioned like iPad Air, better display and processing power.
MacBook Pro 16-inch is like the iPad Pro, which it has the best of everything, including the best appearance, best features, best iPhone ever processing power and graphic with all the options to make it really pro including upgrading the storage to the ridiculous possible size etc."
mbp 16,This is the best mb pro with scissor kb Liao. If return.. the waiting game is no joke. Rather keep and use if new one comes by then sell and ‘upgrade’
mbp 16,"I got the 8 core, 1TB one"
mbp 16,"Sorry for the noob qns but cant seem to find the right thread for this..
Anyone got recommendations for the usb hub/ports?"
mbp 16,Recommend this
mbp 16,I’ll recommend this.
mbp 16,Nice this is a new product released not Long ago. Should be around 150 after shipping
mbp 16,Thanks for the recommendations! Is there any that is connect directly at the side of the laptop? Means no cable involved.. cuz my portable hdd alr got cable 😅 if nt v messy
mbp 16,This one go for hyper
mbp 16,Yeap I agree. Else go for Satechi. The 2 more reputable brands.
mbp 16,I recommend hyperdrive too. I am using the 9 in 1 one. But has a cable dangling though.
mbp 16,Anyone experienced popping sound in the speakers when you stop an audio track Spotify or close a youtube video when it is playing? It doesn't affect me much but still unsettles me.
mbp 16,"Yes. On my 16"" Macbook Pro. I have already sent feedback to"
mbp 16,Yea I googled and found this to be a common issue unfortunately. Can update if they get back to you? I need the laptop for my exams over the next 2 weeks so I can’t bring it down to Apple Store to check yet.
mbp 16,Yes a lot of cracking sound
mbp 16,My friend also confirmed can hear. Hopefully it is just an issue that can be solved with software update. Else there will a major recall for a this excellent MacBook.
mbp 16,"No need to bring down. Even if you go for a replacement, likely to get back one with the same issue."
mbp 16,does the cracking sound last very long or jus a split second type~?
mbp 16,"It happens in a split second, when I close a YouTube video for instance. It doesn’t affect my workflow whatsoever but it’s definitely loud and annoying. I read that it occurs frequently for those using FCP to edit videos."
mbp 16,Okay. Keeping my 16” and trading in with brightstar for my 13” 2015 one. Bought in Australia so it came with an Australian plug head.
mbp 16,How much is Brightstar offering you?
mbp 16,Around $300+
mbp 16,What are the specs?
mbp 16,"I cannot remember in detail . It’s the basic 13” 2015 pro model.
8GB RAM. No graphics card"
mbp 16,I asked because a relative of mine managed to sell his 13” retina 2013 for $400 on carsousell a couple of months back.
mbp 16,Older MacBook Pro really convenient with the ports available
mbp 16,Carousell probably can fetch higher price but must be prepared to meet all sort of buyers including those last minute no show or bargain on the spot. Some have expectations whatever you are selling to be in a perfect condition like brand new even though it is few years ago. BrightStar is more straightforward and save you time and frustration of dealing with such buyers.
mbp 16,Get used to it. Soon there will be no ports
mbp 16,Thats also one of the reason why I dont wish to change my 2015 MBP yet.
mbp 16,No USB ports jin Sian
mbp 16,"My favourite mouse requires USB port.
Older macbook feel more sturdy also and the Apple logo does light up.
I find the older kb more tactile too"
mbp 16,You summed up the reasons why I am lazy to deal with Carousell buyers.
mbp 16,"Hey all, another Student here...
I'm seriously considering getting the 16"" MBP now.
But if I get it, bootcamp must function just as well as a typical windows 10 laptop.
This is because my school is predominately a windows-only environment. Most softwares of my course are exclusive to windows only
I can't get a windows laptop as my photography/filmmaking hobby heavily relies on Mac OS. Photoshop + FCPX user
So, have anyone tried bootcamp before? I heard that the dedicated Radeon Graphics is forever switched-on, hence draining the battery significantly faster compared to Mac OS. Correct me if I'm wrong"
mbp 16,You might want to use a VM like Parallels instead of running Bootcamp.
mbp 16,"Just got hands on the 16 inch MacBook Pro at i Studio just now
I used the 13 inch compare to 16 inch like no difference
The keyboard feels like the same as 13 inch just ticker that’s all."
mbp 16,"VM will struggle as the windows programs I use are CPU + GPU intensive.
eg. 3D Modelling with 3DS Max & Revit
Btw, these Radeon 5000M series graphics work way better than the GTX1650s that are found on most windows laptops.
They're very much optimised for workstation use.
That's why I'm so inclined to go for Macs even though they're not windows native devices."
mbp 16,"I find VM too laggy for me... bootcamp is my preference.
Running bootcamp has it pros and cons.
Macbook pro is a very solid hardware, so far never have a BSOD. Compared to my other new i9 Lenovo which BSOD at least once a day.
The downside, it runs hot and the fan spin-up very quickly even on light loads. Guess its the combination of win 10 and driver issues e.g, unable to turn off the GFX when idling. Now matter how it drains the battery, it still outlast the lenovo. The retina screen is the sharpest and best color accurate one...
Till today, in my opinion MBP is the best non-gaming win10 laptop money can buy ignoring the lack of ports, and weight...But if you just run MS office, its an overkill and waste of $$$."
mbp 16,"Interesting... May I know what's battery life like for both the Lenovo and MBP? When the MBP is in bootcamp mode of course
Also, is your MBP a 15"" model with discrete graphics?"
mbp 16,"I agree on the keyboard. I currently use Magic Keyboard 2 from my 5K iMac. The 16"" MBP ones still lack the key travel of the 5K iMac ones. In short, they're deeper than the 2016 MBP but shallower than the 5K iMac.
Still a little uncomfortable IMO.
Oh, one thing to note is that the 16"" screen is 100 nits dimmer than it's predecessor. Approx 410nits So false marketing there from Apple."
mbp 16,"For those who have purchased the 16"" MBP:
Are they Malaysian sets? You can check it out on the outer box packaging. My previous purchase from Apple.sg was a Malaysian one. So I thought if those in the stores are SG ones, it""ll be better to pick it up than to get it delivered.
I'm asking this cuz I need a valid 1 year SG warranty. Won't be purchasing AC+ as it's not worth it"
mbp 16,"If they can bring back the keyboard from MacBook Pro with Retina display that will be good. I still using the 13” MacBook Pro with Retina Display from 2013 and still loving it
That is still the best MacBook Pro keyboard I have ever used"
mbp 16,"have you considered XPS 15? Or XPS 13 for u prefer a small form factor
Posted from Hell B18 HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,What Malaysian set? Don’t get it.
mbp 16,Pretty sure Malaysian sets also can get it serviced in Singapore
mbp 16,"It just happen so MY and SG are sharing the same model configurations plugs and etc and thus, the same packaging, for both countries.
So don’t have to worry if AppleCare doesn’t cover. It does cover in SG and internationally too.
All Things  Pro on the HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,"I think you might not have known. Even a US set can be service in Singapore. SG and Malaysia set shared the same model number so doesn’t matter if it’s Singapore or Malaysia set. Both are the same.
And for the screen brightness, you are wrong. In fact, the screen this year is lightly brighter than last year model."
mbp 16,"Its as good as asking apple to remove the touchbar, or adding a sdcard reader ;-
Passby an apple shop near my house, test drive the 16"" MBP keyboard seems more ""firm"" then previous version, but still mallow compared to the best in class keyboard from lenovo. Most important the ESC key is back.... 5.5k with applecare... No hurry, maybe will get one after christmas...just maybe..."
mbp 16,XPS are the best looking windows laptop i think
mbp 16,How is MacBook not the nicest looking laptop? It’s designed by Jony Ive even.
mbp 16,Best looking windows laptop will be MacBook Pro running bootcamp
mbp 16,"Yes, but I need Mac OS to run FCPX especially."
mbp 16,"Cool, didn't know that standard 1 year warranty is international warranty."
mbp 16,"As much as possible I""ll stay away from Dell because their after sales service is basically non-existent. They don't even have an official warehouse in SG and all purchases from the flagship store have to be back-ordered and shipped from Malaysia.
IMO, the Surface Book 2 is the nicest looking windows laptop. But it costs slightly more than the 16"" MBP with a dated and underpowered CPU+GPU. 2017 Hardware
So now I'm left with Apple MBP 16"". It's marginally cheaper than the Dell and Microsoft. Plus, I study overseas and global warranty coverage certainly helps a lot."
mbp 16,"Hi guys anyone using it for data science work? I'm thinking of going for 2.3 i9 8 core, 64 GB ram and 1 TB. Should I take 5500 4 GB or 8 GB?
Sent from HUAWEI VOG-L29 using GAGT"
mbp 16,"For data science, you don’t need GPU. Just focus on CPU and RAM."
mbp 16,"Don’t have to go until 64gb. 32 is sweet spot for many editors
5500 4gb to 8gb is a $100+ jump if u wanna max out the graphics"
mbp 16,Is it better to run parallel or bootcamp
mbp 16,You don’t need 64GB for data science work. 32GB is more than enough.
mbp 16,It depends on usage. Can always try parallels first before doing bootcamp.
mbp 16,"For data science work, you can go for a maxed out 13"" MacBook Pro. Then, invest on a solid monitor like the LG 5K UltraFine Display or the upcoming Apple XDR Display. Launching in December
16"" display won't do justice for data stuff. You""ll need a much larger canvas. 27"" or 32"" monitor preferably."
mbp 16,"That's what I thought. Cos my games also don't really use much gpu lol. Just that sometimes I do Photoshop and Lightroom I think should be fine right. Should I go 2.4 i9 processor with 5300 4gb or 2.3 i9 5500 4gb ?
Thanks guys but I was using Thinkpad T series with 32gb ram and it's getting slow when I'm transforming huge dataset. So I thought 64 might ease the load in the long run.
I have monitor. Actually more for on the go too when running overseas and no monitor. Battery life is impt. But idk if a higher end graphic like 5500 will eat up my batt life?
Sent from HUAWEI VOG-L29 using GAGT"
mbp 16,"In general, the higher the ram, the higher the power consumption. This applies to both DDR4 Ram and GDDR6 VRam.
There have been reports of 3-4h battery life on the 16"" MBP when running with web coding applications. No Utilisation of GPU
If your'e focus is on battery life, maybe try out the XPS 15 7590 with the 1080p screen. You""ll get ~6h of battery life with intensive usage."
mbp 16,"If battery life is a concern, can get a powerbank for laptop. There are some powerbank with PD and USB-C that can charge USB-C laptop.
Maybe an extra thing to carry around, but beats having to find a table in a public place cafe with a electrical socket nearby
Posted from Hell B18 HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,"You should go for 2.3Ghz model with 64GB RAM and 5500M 4GB GPU. This should suit your usage. You need that H processor instead of the U processor found in 13”. That additional GHz in the 2.4Ghz doesn’t justify the $200+ increase.
Then again, $140 upgrade to 8GB GPU is worth it."
mbp 16,"I have tried the Xiaomi powerbank gen 3 20k mah which supports 45W pd. Still a bit slow to charge since this laptop comes with a 96w brick.
Searched high and low but most powerbanks with wattage of 60W and above are like about $200.. until I found zmi powerpack 20k pro which gives out 65W and only costs $90. Gets the juice up fast as well.
Omni 20c is good also but too expensive. Does anyone know if we can plug in 97w brick into Ravpower 20100 mAh Powerbank that has a 3 pin UK port."
mbp 16,"May not be necessary translate to better performance with 64GB Ram. Suspect it's the I/O bottleneck...
What's your task manager committed and cache memory values under peak load?"
mbp 16,I got the zendure one which can charge up to 100W along with the power adapter which can juice up the Powerbank in 100W in just an hr.
mbp 16,"How much and from where? If too expensive maybe won’t consider
since the laptop doesn’t charge at full 96W throughout"

20v 3a"
mbp 16,Bros do you think I should get a screen protector for my 16 inch MBP? If not will kenna keyboard stains?
mbp 16,"This is personal preference.
Personally I wouldn't since it would hinder the typing experience."
mbp 16,Mine on Zendure.
mbp 16,"Nice man. Omni got a 100w one now but expensive

Wait bf and see if zendure or omni give discounts"
mbp 16,"I think there would be like probably 20-30%.
Hyper+ will definitely give some discount.
Anyway bro, what is the wattage showing in your MBP when charging with Omni?"
mbp 16,It shows 60w
mbp 16,"If the default charger wattage comes at X watts but you charge the mac at X+y watts... will it damage the mac ? Be it air, or pro.... the air comes default as 30w, but I feel like using my pro charger to charge the air."
mbp 16,Will not. They draw the right amount only

mbp 16,Is everyone here getting or got the space grey version? Anyone into silver?
mbp 16,Space gray more premium leh
mbp 16,If use egpu a must
mbp 16,Silver is more wear resistant and compliment the MacBook well. The Space Gray to me is not that fantastic in certain angle. Purplish greenish hue.
mbp 16,I got the Space Gray version but now also feeling a bit bored of the colour. Used to be a novelty color when I bought my 2017 MacBook Pro but now no longer the case.

Anyone knows whether they tend to home deliver earlier than scheduled for custom configurations?"
mbp 16,"From what I know, no. Apple usually don’t deliver earlier unless there is a change in circumstances.
May I ask what you use your MacBook for? The specs looks high-end."
mbp 16,Omg wtf. Thats a damn good deal leh. Trying to sell away my late 2017 15 model before I can buy the new one. 😭
mbp 16,"Ok thanks for the info!
Will mainly be using it for 4K Video Editing, 42MP Raw Photo Editing, and 3D Modelling of high-rise buildings. Autocad, Revit, Rhino, 3Ds Max, Maya, Photoshop, FCPX & After Effects Hence, I""ll be dual booting as some apps are only exclusive to either of the OS.
Anyway if I find the specs overkill, if I'm not wrong, I can return and get a lower specced one. We""ll see."
mbp 16,Your work seems fit for the specs mentioned. You’ll be fine with what you have ordered I think.
mbp 16,"Which usb hub did u guys get?
Ugreen or baseus?
Posted with  iPhone 11 PRO  HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,Didn’t get any. But would choose Baseus if I have to.
mbp 16,"I have been using dodocool for about 2 years now. It's very reliable, compact and light. However, it runs warm when only 1 peripheral is connected. eg. 4K HDMI @ 60HZ I guess this is normal as these hubs aren't directly powered from a socket.
P.s. You can't go wrong with Ugreen and Baseus too. They're solid brands."
mbp 16,"Bro, why not get the i9 2.4Ghz, 2TB, 32GB RAM, 5500M 8GB config and you can get it almost immediately?"
mbp 16,"Isn't that a custom configuration that is only available online? I just cannot justify the $200 1Ghz base clock difference. 2TB is nice for dual booting but I'm a student and opting for the i9 1TB config is as good as buying a motorbike liao.
In fact, I'm even considering returning the 2.3Ghz i9 MBP for a slower model. i7, 32GB DDR4, 1TB SSD, 5300M 4GB
But I""ll have to test it out. If I don't take advantage of the beefy hardware, I might make this move."
mbp 16,Yes that’s a custom build but only that build has it readily available. i7 processor might not be enough for your 3D modelling though I’m not sure how heavy a user are you.
mbp 16,"Oh cool, The jewel staff didn't tell me such a config is available. I too can't tell yet on how much power I need. All I can say is that my i7-7700HQ is always at 100% Utilisation whenever I 3D Model. But that's a 7th gen quad core processor. Have to buy and test the MBP to find out, no choice."
mbp 16,"hmm. if you are using gfx software that is exclusive to Windows, my suggestion will always to not get a Macbook. even though you can dual boot, i used to have thermal issues when playing a 5 years old game. performance of bootcamp is abit dubious as well.
plus some of those software runs better with CUDA core which is NVIDIA exclusive."
mbp 16,"Anyone bought the Caldigit TS3+ docking station?
It has 85W charging but a Caldigit employee mentioned they will release a firmware update by the end of 2019 to cope with the new 96W charging of the 16"" MBP."
mbp 16,A few Apple related outlets reporting this already. Seems like it is related to Catalina as opposed to hardware?
mbp 16,Likely to be software problem. It’s almost affecting 90% of the 16” MacBook.
mbp 16,"Just received the 16"" MBP. Already can hear popping sounds  from the welcome screen by selecting random language sounds. Should I return it?
The volume and intensity of the ""Pop"" is highly variable. Can be really soft or loud."
mbp 16,"depends on whether it really is software related. if software related, then still can wait.
but isnt the popping sound from a selection of softwares FCP~?"
mbp 16,The popping sound sounds more like software issue than hardware.
mbp 16,"I don't think it's related to any specific Mac software. I highly suspect it's either a hardware defect or a Mac OS bug. Will be installing bootcamp shortly, that will confirm whether it's software or hardware related."
mbp 16,same as this one mah~?
mbp 16,Alamak.... xiao liao....
mbp 16,"This Utuber did some deep dive on the popping issue.
Maybe is good to share here"
mbp 16,"Yes, exactly the same."
mbp 16,"Ok, installed bootcamp. Popping still exists but it's slightly softer on windows. Tested on YouTube with Microsoft Edge.
Apple just sent a memo to Apple Staffs to deny replacements as they claim it's a software issue. I wonder why it exists on Windows 10 then. Sounds to me like a sound card or wiring issue to 1 of the 6 speakers."
mbp 16,"Apple Investigating 16-Inch MacBook Pro Popping Sound Issue, Fix Planned in Future Software Updates"
mbp 16,Since it can be workaround then a software fix will do.
mbp 16,It’s definitely a software/ driver issue. Happened before. Just wait for Apple to release software fix. No need to be alarm.
mbp 16,Thought this issue is common in the 15’ as well. Only fixing it when more complain
mbp 16,"I dont have this problem on my 2015 15 MBP, also running Catalina 10.15.1."
mbp 16,"Not all macbooks will have this issue.
Like my 16” doesn’t experience any popping sound."
mbp 16,Let’s see if the macOS 10.15.2 update will fix the problem later. Many people on the beta have reported that it seemed to be fixed.
mbp 16,"2018 15’ one got quite a number of users report.
Saw this
Somewhat genius design but not digging the look"
mbp 16,Popping issues seemed fixed with macOS 10.15.2 update.
mbp 16,Officially released already ah. I’ll update it tonight and see if issue has been fixed.
mbp 16,I have not tested. Just reading from others. I’ve updated but hopefully it’s fixed.
mbp 16,"@7:47th mark.
as expected. performance is abysmal for Bootcamp."
mbp 16,I just tested it. It’s solved the issue for me. Hope yours is ok too.
mbp 16,I haven’t tested it. I have no 100% way to reproduce the error. Mine comes randomly.
mbp 16,hows e new keyboard? I was at  store just now n tested some typing. e new key travel is still shallow but better than e previous butterfly keyboard
mbp 16,"I personally like the butterfly keyboard. But I guess this is a good compromise for the so called “widespread sticky keys” problem. So it’s perfect for me. If you like it, just get it. I think it’s going to be a stable good MacBook for a while till the new design comes."
mbp 16,16inch is like too big for me cos I bring it around so Ill wait for smaller size.
mbp 16,Oh I see. Then wait for 14”
mbp 16,"Updated mine to 15.2. It's fixed on the Mac OS side but on bootcamp, popping still exists."
mbp 16,"Yeap, bootcamp runs poorly. But it's simply due to Apple not putting enough effort to optimise their drivers for windows. The main issue so far is fan management control. 3rd party apps like throttlestop did help a lot for the CPU but GPU continues to go bananas. So the fan speeds can ramp up to 5200rpm despite the overal temp being at 60°C."
mbp 16,"Heng never upgrade to 16 lol
So many probs"
mbp 16,Wtf are you talking about?
mbp 16,"Time is bad.
Some Big Department Stores you can walk in and ask for small discount for MacBook Pro 16."
mbp 16,Still got huge margin one ma
mbp 16,"What problems?

crackling sound fixed liao"
mbp 16,Not sure but I getting quoted 4-5% off. I wish get 10-15% will be better. 😆
mbp 16,"Yeah. Don’t know what’s the problem he mentioned. Probably is the boot camp thing.
But who buys a mac to install crap OS like Windows?"
mbp 16,"Get straight from Apple Ma. Educational price is the cheapest Liao.
Unless they have refurbished + edu"
mbp 16,Refurbished is the cheapest lol. Wasted the discount cannot stack.
mbp 16,Lazada selling $3499 16 MacBook Pro at 10% discount in case anyone interested but only for silver colour.
mbp 16,$3499 16 MacBook Pro now with 11% discount at Lazada but only Silver colour in case anyone still interested.
mbp 16,"Where did you see this? At the Apple store page in Lazada, only 4%"
mbp 16,"Billy never post it again today, promo must be over already."
mbp 16,"Yes, it was a limited time offer by Lazada. I will continue to monitor regularly the price and will post here if I spot any deals with 7% or higher discount."
mbp 16,"I bought mine from gain city same price as educational pricing, 3708 plus 439 for apple care+ still got bunch of freebies on top.."
mbp 16,Thank you! Do they have discount for iPad also?
mbp 16,"My 16 MacBook Pro has popping sound watching Netflix on safari when u jump the video....
I took the standard 1tb config. Anyone has similar issue? I tested out a 16 model at epi Center no such problem...
Is it fixable by hardware or software issue?"
mbp 16,This should be fixed in the latest OS update.
mbp 16,"my OS is up to date since day 1. I still hear the popping.
Anyone watches Netflix on safari? It only happens when I back up the video or closes it. Not sure if I should send it in...l"
mbp 16,"I have the same MBP as yours. It's running on the latest 15.2 update and I'm still hearing loud popping sounds on Safari. However, all other apps I tested have been resolved. If you were to use Chrome, you won't hear any pop.
This is a software issue known on T2 Chip based Macs. Just wait for 15.3 update and hope for the best."
mbp 16,"chrome is ok, but the resolution is only 720p for Netflix? also people say chrome is a battery hog... So I am sticking with safari
Apple TV app also got popping sound.... even their own app has issues..."
mbp 16,"Yes sometimes there would be discounts, but if you want savings; I would recommend you buy refurbished iPads instead but I digress as this forum is for MacBook Pro 16”"
mbp 16,"Totally agree, chrome is just.. meh..."
mbp 16,"hey guys, when using the 96w charger provided by apple, how fast is your laptop charging? i am getting 70-90w. how about yours?
when i use this charger from anker at work, i get about 60w.. will bring it home and try to see if it's the sockets at my workplace that has problems"
mbp 16,Guys. How long is the delivery by Lazada?
mbp 16,"What sort of freebies?
I was checking Harvey Norman and they have a 3% discount of MBP 16"". Promotion till 24 jan."
mbp 16,"just got the 3999 version 3702 after education discount, enjoying it so far, the speakers are really good, installing bootcamp now, will see how it fares in light gaming"
mbp 16,Wah $3702! So good you got educational discount.. I trying to check gain city if they still have the price as advertised $3709
mbp 16,Anyone installed screen protector? Required?
mbp 16,i got the same one at educational pricing too! loving it
mbp 16,i don’t think it is needed
mbp 16,"Really tempted to purchase 1 16 inch MBP. but the thing is i'm not gonna use it to do any video editing or photo editing. just gonna be using it casually for entertainment, document writing, presentation slides, excel, emails, etc.
So is it overkill to get 16 inch? and go for the macbook air?
Personally i would want the 16inch but the 3500 is a bit painful.
Advice please?"
mbp 16,"If u need the screen size, want the best then go for it.
Macbook lasts for many years. Think of it as investment"
mbp 16,Refurbished models appearing soon!
mbp 16,"heng suay bah.. definitely doesn't last many years for me

twice my 2 mbp mobo died after 1 year."
mbp 16,"If, u have ur own desk/room, maybe can consider getting the mbp 13"" or air and connect to a good external monitor?
seriously, its a waste to spend so much just for bigger screen and casual use."
mbp 16,"There are so many other 15.6 inch laptops out there in the market that can do those task at significantly lower price point.
Don't buy this just because it's Apple.
Buy for the work you do."
mbp 16,"For your usage, a MacBook Air will be good enough. If you want a bigger screen then connect it to an external monitor. You can save a ton more with external monitor setup."
mbp 16,"Buying it cause of the ecosystem of Apple. The convenience of using Apple.
Other laptops are not iOS unfortunately"
mbp 16,"I do have a gaming desktop at home. But the laptop is mainly to bring to office to use. Since there’s limited internet access at work and work laptop can only connect to intranet.
Have always find 13 inch to be a little tad small"
mbp 16,"My 15’ model since 2013 until now. Still good. Even got a USB c to MagSafe charger for it

I would always recommend getting MAC for his kind of usage. Not only is the whole system very reliable. Battery life is solid and more secure than windows.
Can consider waiting for their rumoured 14’ as well since the only lineup with improved keyboard is with the 16’ for now"
mbp 16,"how does one buy the macbook pro at education pricing? upon paying at the apple education page, do I need to show my student card upon collection?"
mbp 16,"Google Apple education store.
They won’t ask for student card upon collection if u look like a student

If u opt for home delivery they might send u an email asking for one just for auditing purposes"
mbp 16,"I'm entering uni this July.
I received the letter but haven't accepted yet.Just incase they ask for proof will that work?"
mbp 16,Has the popping sound issues being fixed in the recent updates?
mbp 16,It’s has been fixed like 2 months ago
mbp 16,"You meant my kind of usage? Haha
Tried the mbp16 a couple of times at Apple store. I have to say the speakers are really awesome.
It is definitely a beast. Just thinking, whether using such a beast to do excel, ppt and word, surfing and video watching if it’s too overkill. Haha.
But the Apple ecosystem and the screen size is just too good.
Should I purchase it now? Or wait for the 2020 mbp16” release?"
mbp 16,If you can afford 16’’ just get it.
mbp 16,Show them ur matriculation letter.
mbp 16,it’ll be an endless waiting game
mbp 16,"If you can afford it go for it. I code for a living and this Macbook hasn't slipped a beat...running multiple instances of VS code, Docker, etc the keyboard is also a joy to type on"
mbp 16,"it is not fixed... But I found a workaround.
Set the sampling in Audio Midi Setup to 48 khertz. My MBP still has popping sound at the default 44.1 khertz.
Try it if yours has popping sound.
such a simple workaround, I wished I chance on it sooner."
mbp 16,"The next big upgrade should be the mini led display. If you can wait for it, why not? The generation is pretty big upgrade though with a new form factor, keyboard, speakers. Plus the regular internals upgrade."
mbp 16,but wouldn't know if they are really releasing Q4 2020 right? lol Q4 is a long while to go. now is only mid Q1! lol
mbp 16,"I do like my 13. Note that the MacBook Pro is also heavier by about 0.3 pounds. If you have accessories designed to fit the 15-inch MacBook Pro, they may not fit the new 16-inch model."
mbp 16,"And if you have a smaller bag or backpack that snugly fits the 15-inch MacBook Pro, the 16-inch model may be too big. So just try first."
mbp 16,"Actually there's no much difference between the new 16"" and the older 15"". Cos they just minimize the bezels for a larger screen."
mbp 16,"Updated and no issues with 10.15.3.
Had the pop on my unit with the preinstalled 10.51.1."
mbp 16,"Trying to sell off sparkling New macbook 15 2019.. anybody wanna check it out ? Haha
Edit: sold my MacBook Pro 15 2019 and bought MacBook Pro 16.. but feels the diff is not significant.."
mbp 16,new MBA with e new scissor keyboard is out
mbp 16,"Any improvement to keyboard? Hows e typing?
Posted with  HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 16,"Any new users of the MacBook Pro 16"" would like to contribute any reviews?  I think this thread got buried so deeply that some are leaving reviews on the 13"" thread."
mbp 16,ya i wonder where the thread disappeared to
mbp 16,"loving the 16"". really the best macbook ive used to far. only complaint i have is the weight and size but thats the caveat when using so much power.
everything else is great. the thinner bezels makes the whole thing so immersive. speakers are fantastic. typing is great took awhile for me to get used to cos ive been using butterfly keyboard for so long
mine is a refurb model, 8-core/1tb/16GB/5500m"
mbp 16,"refurbished, will there be any mild scratches or dings on the exterior or dead pixel on lcd etc....?
cos usually only got issues then ppl will return the machine to apple mah."
mbp 16,You can check and if not happy return for another one.
mbp 16,I am eyeing that model too! Does the fan run noisy frequently? Did you buy Apple care+?
mbp 16,"Im using similar model but configured with 32GB and this thing runs like a beast.
I ran 4K video in the background while doing editing with AI and also FaceTime call, this MacBook takes everything in its stride. Fans kicked up but its not loud that it irritates me."
mbp 16,"I bought AppleCare+ for mine using the education store. Buying the refurbished set means like paying the actual retail price with additional savings PLUS the AppleCare - which costs $489 mind you. It will come with a new outer shell so no scratches la. Returned sets could also be people who bought and returned during the 14-day window period.
I sent my 15"" for repair last year and Apple did an amazing job replacing the battery and outer shell for me for free when they deducted an issue which wasn't caused by me. Apple's service is seriously stellar. Noted that there are people who faced issues with Apple before but I've always been lucky since I became a user in 2009.
The fan will be a little more noisy and the area above keyboard more warm only if I turn off graphic switching. Other than that nah I never ever hear the fan unless I turn on Dota 2.
On a side note, if you're not editing high res video daily, I really think that the amd 5500m 8gb will be an overkill...."
mbp 16,Wow. The 32GB upgrade cost $600 more. Guess it is worth it if you are making money from it.
mbp 16,"apple refurbs are as good as new.
i'm super anal when it comes to things like dings and scratches....none of the sort at all....perfectly MINT"
mbp 16,"going to use it for a few more days and then i'll get apple care. making sure that there is no issues before i get it...fans only kicked in during indexing and rendering.
the thing you gotta realise is, there are two kinds of fan noise....the screeching turbo jet engine kind from windows based machines and then the kind from macs which is a lower frequency and doesn't annoy me as much."
mbp 16,"on the refurb store now, you can get the upgraded model thats $4.7k at retail for $3.9k now. thats MASSIVE savings for a crazy ass beast laptop. i was tempted by it but i'm saving the $$ for now cos there is a good chance that i'll upgrade to the next upgrade when/if its got mini-led displays."
mbp 16,I just got UAG Hard Casing for Macbook Pro 16 yesterday arrived.
mbp 16,"Good decision. I think Mini-LED if ever coming to MBP, will take at least 2 years. Macbook or MacBook Air will get them first."
mbp 16,"It is alive again! Still a very good computer despite the release of a new toy 10 gen MacBook Pro 13""."
mbp 16,Its definitely coming next year along with a refreshed design and processor. Keep a look out for it
mbp 16,"this is the only reason why i've not gone for a 32gb model. just waiting for a revolutionary re-design. the design of the 16"" gives me confidence"
mbp 16,"If it is a re-design, it is better not to go for the first iteration. I think you can safely use your 16"" for 3 years before investing in a new and more mature version."
mbp 16,"The MBP 16"" sounds like a dyson fan tower AM07 but in auto-breeze mode."
mbp 16,"haha yes exactly! its loud but not obnoxious,as it should be to cool that processor and gpu
i dunno man, ive tried the gaming laptops from razer, msi, asus.....the sound of their fans just irritate me. probably the frequency?
anyway thats why ive gone with the 16"" also la.....i casualyl play LoL , PUBG & Overwatch and its sufficient at 1440p"
mbp 16,Frequency is one thing but the design of the blades and chamber are important aspects of fan noise. Apple has always done wonderful jobs in their fans design.
mbp 16,"Do you guys still experience the ""pop"" sound issue?  Read from other forums the issue still exists."
mbp 16,Yeap it's still there. Gotten used to it already.
mbp 16,"When gaming with the 16"", I usually put on a laptop stand, just to make sure the air disperses more efficiently. The fan noise will also be less prominent."
mbp 16,Nearly 8 months and Apple still unable able to solve it.
mbp 16,"Hi I have just purchased my new 16 MacBook Pro but right now Im having some dilemma on choosing the right monitor.
Im pretty much a tech idiot so I would like to get some help in choosing the right monitor!
Im currently looking at 2 ultrawide monitors from
prism +
X300 has a resolution of 2560x1080, 200hz refresh rate and comes with HDMI 2.0 ports along w HDMI 1.4 and Display ports
X290 has the same resolution of 2560x1080, 100hz refresh rate and only has HDMI 1.4 and display ports
While Im more than happy paying the extra money for the x300, Im just wondering if our 16 MBP GPU can support the specs of monitor 1, or is monitor 1 a bit of an overkill here?
Thank you in advance!!!"
mbp 16,"The MacBook Pro can connects up to 2 6K 60Hz or 4 4K external monitors through TB3 USB-C.
I would recommend a monitor that comes with a USB C port so you can connect to your MacBook Pro 16""."
mbp 16,"Thanks adiboy!
What about the use of an USB-C to HDMI adaptor? Will that affect the graphics? Or its just an hassle because I need to buy an extra adaptor?"
mbp 16,"ya, u can prob daisy chain e 2 monitors thru 1 TB3 also."
mbp 16,Anyone using the base i9 model?  Any feedback or regrets?
mbp 16,i9 machine here and no regrets! Beast of a machine and the sound quality from the speaker is second to none in the market.
mbp 16,Working well even when connected to an external monitor?
mbp 16,You can now configure your Macbook Pro 16' to have a AMD Radeon Pro 5600M graphics with 8GB of HBM2 memory
mbp 16,"I never connect mine to external monitor... the screen to me is big enough to work on, even for my photo editing.
I switch my 32"" dell monitor which I used to edit colors for my photos to a 55"" TV because I feel the macbook pro 16 screen is good enough."
mbp 16,"Base i9 user here. The only complaint I have is that the fans get very noisy and the surface around the touch bar area gets warm easily. This occurs whenever the dedicated graphics are in use. So plugging the 16"" to a monitor will force enable the Radeon card, and drive the fans to around 2800rpm without any background  application running. If you were to run Zoom with external monitor, that would bump the fan speed to 4400rpm. This is in contrast to the idle fan speed of 1800rpm. However, this does not mean that the 16"" cannot perform intensive tasks. In fact, the i9 never throttled. It just remained warm at 74°C consistently. If you currently own a Dyson fan or hairdryer, the 16"" MacBook Pro fans will sound no different. It's the exact same sound frequency, some like it, others don't.
The 6-Core i7 will probably be quiter and cooler. But I can't confirm this.
Besides this, I must say the 16"" retina screen with thin bezels are nice. The speakers are undoubtedly the best in the market. The tweeters can produce higher highs than my Bose 2.1 speakers. And of course, the aluminium body."
mbp 16,"I pair my new 16"" with Dell U2020Q USB-C monitor. A very great pair.. I don't hear the noise at all unless I turn on Steam or on long usage with a Chrome browser. The speaker... is too good. Sometimes I don't even turn on my Bose speakers."
mbp 16,"Very loud leh 16 inch base model....
But the built in speakers are very good"
mbp 16,does it perform well on final cut pro?
mbp 16,What are you doing at the time when the fans get noisy?
mbp 16,"just hoot 1 from apple online last night, education price + 4.5% cashback from shopback
i9 2.3ghz, 32gb ram, 1tb ssd and 5600m 8gb hbm2 ....patiently waiting for delivery now..."
mbp 16,Wow.. You hooted the highest end graphics card. Congrats!
mbp 16,"Anyone know of any shop I can go to, to help install a screen protector for the MBP 16?"
mbp 16,Dont think the gpu is worth it on mbp
mbp 16,"Depends.. If you are making money out of your MBP, time is very important."
mbp 16,"Yea, for the work i do, short turnaround time to deliver to clients is impt to me, so just bite the bullet and get it"
mbp 16,When is yours coming?
mbp 16,Between 7th - 10th jul
mbp 16,Why not get imac with vega then?
mbp 16,I only using 5300m here. Performance soso lol. Need 5500m minimum I think.
mbp 16,What is the use case?
mbp 16,"anyone can advise on this?
i input the serial number of my mac and it says that 'This device isn’t currently accepted for trade in. It is still eligible for free recycling.'
wonder why? it's only a year old."
mbp 16,"For which model? Sometimes if too new, they will not accept also."
mbp 16,"2019 13"" Macbook Pro."
mbp 16,"Need that 5600m at the very least.
Else don't bother."
mbp 16,Planning to buy a refurbished Mac. Is 1 TB storage enough for future proofing?
mbp 16,How do you define future proofing? Continue to get support from Apple?
mbp 16,"You can always get external HDDs... how much do you need access to immediately that takes up so much space?
And if you're saying that you're doing 8k video editing, i think your setup needs to be very much different.
So all that aside, yes it's plenty of space."
mbp 16,"Definitely no plans in doing 8k video editing. Planning to use it for 4k non-professional editing.
Just thinking if 1TB is enough as a scratch disk or need to have more internal storage."
mbp 16,4K non-professional = 4K from phone those kind of source files? then yes should be plenty enough for each edit. Maybe around 200 ~ 300GB per hour of footage. So yes you will still need to constantly offload to an external HDD once you're done with each project.
mbp 16,I plan to be a professional youtuber like techlead. What kind of macbook should i get? Or imac?

mba 2020,Already have a thread on it
mba 2020,"Hey guys, since all Apple Stores are closed till further notice, anyone knows when the display sets will be out at Challenger or other reseller stores?"
mba 2020,That thread like not much traction and the title seems weird =/
mba 2020,The difference between 2019 and 2020 is just the internals and keyboard. Based on experience it will take 1-3 months to refresh the stocks.
mba 2020,"i think the keyboard feel is the same as the 16"" mbp
u can go challenger or best denki try out , they have 16"" display sets there"
mba 2020,"called apple, they say resellers won't have the display for macbook air 2020 so soon, so i guess we can only use the 16"" mbp as a guage of how the keyboard feels."
mba 2020,The keyboard will be the same as the the 16 MacBook Pro.
mba 2020,Is there a i7 option via the online store? don't see it.
mba 2020,Yup just select any i3 or i5 and u can see the processor upgrade
mba 2020,Rumours has it that new model has an improved keyboard and lower starting price. I want!
mba 2020,Not rumours 😂 its true
mba 2020,"And significantly much faster too than previous generation of MacBook Air. For those looking for a compact and lightweight macbook, now is a good time to get the latest MacBook Air."
mba 2020,Should I get ipad Pro or MacBook Air?
mba 2020,Do you see yourself using Apple Pencil? Writing. Drawing? Because that's really the selling point of the iPad Pro
mba 2020,"Get both.
Compliments each other."
mba 2020,"iPad Pro is still not a viable replacement to a laptop imo.
Even with a trackpad its still limited by the OS."
mba 2020,"Anyway for anyone interested in testing out the demo set was spotted at istudio Paya Lebar Quarter.
This is not an advertisement for them
I just happened to walk in and saw it"
mba 2020,"Thank you, are there any stocks for sale there?"
mba 2020,"Thanks everyone for the advice!
think I will go for MacBook Air as I am not into drawing and writing"
mba 2020,"Anyone have MAC air 2020 version, any good suggest for this unit ? This unit can get very warm after few hour of usage."
mba 2020,why wud it get warm? u doing CPU intensive things for a few hours?
mba 2020,Some normal usage can produce alot of heat load and wear off easily.
mba 2020,saw display unit at gain city shops.
mba 2020,"normal usage like? if u're doing intensive CPU stuff like video encoding u're better off with a Macbook Pro. Air is meant for everyday tasks like web browsing, documents, media consumption."
mba 2020,Better to upgrade to 16gb ram?
mba 2020,"I ordered a i7 , 16GB ram version on 20 mar 2020. Stuck at processing, Still waiting for delivery"

mba 2020,"My current batt is very weak. Prob an hour if the charging does work.
How much is the batt and also how long does it last now?"
mba 2020,I paid $185. still can last about 5hrs now.
mba 2020,How the performance different between i3 n i5 for this macbook air ?
mba 2020,Benchmark here : https://www.imore.com/early-macbook-air-i7-benchmarks-prove-i5-might-be-one-pick
mba 2020,it looks like theres some hard limit on e cpu. which makes sense cos else it wud eat into MacBook Pro market share
mba 2020,"besides the .edu store, any good deals for the basic version?"
mba 2020,"Edu store still offers a better price. They never check for online purchases. Got mine early on Saturday.
The new MacBook Air is really zippy and the battery life is awesome."
mba 2020,When did you order yours? Mine 1.5 weeks ago still processing
mba 2020,I ordered on the 20th received it on the 4th
mba 2020,"I ordered mine on 28/03, with an estimated delivery date of 09/04 to 17/04. Current status is still under processing."
mba 2020,"Thanks for info
Hope you're liking it
27/3 showing 7/4 to 16/4
Should be shipping anytime this week"
mba 2020,Which configuration did you get? Is it hot when using?
mba 2020,I love the 2012 version too.. unfortunately the logic board spoilt and repair cost around $800+.
mba 2020,Anyone knows if delivery times for MBA is accurate? Thinking of ordering one but it says delivery date 22/4 - 29/4. Are there times where the delivery is earlier than stated timing?
mba 2020,"Largely accurate.
However, due to the global situation affecting even logistics and shipments, give and take is necessary, expect it to arrive on the last few days or even exceeding quoted dates."
mba 2020,"i5 8GB 256GB MBA 2020
Order Placed:27 March 2020
Arrives 07/04/2020 - 16/04/2020
Preparing to ship"
mba 2020,"Thinking of buying this to bootcamp, is it a good idea?"
mba 2020,"Probably not.
The fan in MBA seems to spin up relatively easily for moderate tasks"
mba 2020,from reviews it seems cpu constantly at 100deg for e slightest tasks. fan also full blast but doesnt cool down cpu cos not connected to heat sink
mba 2020,a lot of reviews advice not to buy 2020 mba cos' of the heatsink issue.
mba 2020,Then the fan is doing what? Just for shown?
mba 2020,air circulation
mba 2020,Hopefully got people mod the heatsink with the fan.
mba 2020,"Static pressure fan
Not as effective as airflow fans"
mba 2020,"Whatever are the comments about it, I have placed an order... it should arrive between 17 and 24 Apr 2020~~
Can't wait~~
i5 quad core
256gb
8g
education price~~"
mba 2020,"For those who are worried about the heatsink, take a look at the video below."
mba 2020,hmm seems pretty ok here 🤔
mba 2020,"The i5 actually has worse battery life, hotter and louder compared to the 2019 version. Yes it's faster but if you want better battery life and don't do any intensive tasks, suggest to go for the i3 version which is good enough for basic tasks."
mba 2020,The new 2020 MacBook Air still shares the same internal layout as the previous version. The fan is not positioned at the heat sink. So there's a high chance the CPU will thermal throttle itself low performance or fried itself due to overheating.
mba 2020,"I was worried about this but not anymore after reading many comments and reviews.
The heat only become an issue if you are doing intensive tasks, such as video rendering, streaming, photoshop, etc etc at the same time. If you think u are going to be doing these, I suggest you get the Macbook Pro.
The Air is not for these purposes.
It can handle the most basic computer tasks with ease emails, youtube, webbrowsing, microsoft office.
Yah chill."
mba 2020,"That is if you are doing intensive tasks, most people buying a macbook air won't be doing any of those and it will be absolutely fine for normal everyday use."
mba 2020,"Totally agree, if you dig deeper into some review. The temperature you're feeling is just around 40+ degree which is the common temperature you will be feeling in the keypad in almost all laptop of this factor."
mba 2020,"True. But as years go by, with every OS updates, every program updates, more process intensive web browsing, more memory needed to stream HD youtube/netflix etc, the 2020 macbook air will heat up very quickly say in 2023. Just like how my 2012 MBP is already heating up to high 70/80 degree activated high fan speed macs fan control surfing on youtube/netflix with Chrome browser.
Although the specs are good for this new MBA, the performance are impeded by this flawed layout. Hence I'll wait for the new 13/14"" MBP which rumour said is coming end of this month."
mba 2020,Really? End of this month?
mba 2020,Take it with pitch of salt.
mba 2020,"Received mine mid noon.
Pretty great machine so far post-setup, yet to start work on it to judge its suitability.
Also eyeing the upcoming 13.3/14 pro model"
mba 2020,Oh! What was your delivery window? Still waiting on mine. 16th-23rd for me
mba 2020,"On mobile, not convenient to multi quote.
Details are on past few pages"
mba 2020,Which model u guys getting?
mba 2020,"Ordered the i5, 16gb, 512gb model. I just sold off my 2015, 15 mbp. I no longer do video work, only light photo editing and adobe indesign work. The 2015, 15 inch is the best laptop I’ve ever owned. It’s a workhorse and has never let me down. But everytime i’d walk by an Apple store, I’d try the 13 inch models and the size is really attractive. Was thinking of upgrading last year but the butterfly keyboards really made me consider. No matter how many times I try it, it felt in every way inferior to the older keyboards Apple used to make. I know this MacBook Air has some thermal issues, however with my workflow, I don’t think it will be that big of a deal. Once the laptop comes in, I’ll use it for a week or so. If it’s doesn’t run well, I’ll return it and wait for the 2020 13inch mbp."
mba 2020,"Ive spent some time with it.
During setup and installation phase, it went as high as sub 80 Celsius.
My normal usage include simultaneously running a tab of script-active chrome, safari browsing, and several messaging apps. Typical observed temps hover around 60 to 70 tops.
Netflix on safari went up to similar temps too. I believe this is an acceptable range for what this device is designed for.
I believe you would do fine
Keyboard wise this felt like a blend of scissors and butterfly switch. I still have my mid 2016 MBP to compare. If anything, the keys on MBA has less wobble and feels somewhat butterfly-like.
Even went to double check if it really is scissors mechanism lol"
mba 2020,"I also want to upgrade to i5 cos of the quad core but is 16gb ram really needed? Cos I come from a window 10 user, so not sure how powerful iOS ram is.
For me base ssd 256gb should be enough as always can do external drive.
Wow ur spec should be near $2k range, can buy mbp anytime."
mba 2020,"Btw do you guys purchase the $308 AppleCare+?
If yes, why?
If no, why?"
mba 2020,"I ordered the same configuration as yours. Ordered on 28 Mar, expected delivery 09 - 17 Apr. Item shipped from China on 14 Apr. As of now, no new updates. May I check how long the item will typically be delivered after the item has shipped?"
mba 2020,peace of mind if u want to use it for > 1 yr
mba 2020,Mine just left the facility in China yesterday. Ordered on April 3rd. Expected delivery date 16th-23rd
mba 2020,"Intel is still making 14nm chips for their latest 10th gen series. We need 7nm to bring temps down on these newer ultrathin machines, especially when a number of these are 4/6/8 cores these days...
I own a 16"" Macbook Pro and it looks like the same thermal issues are happening on the 2020 MacBook Air."
mba 2020,"If DHL Express, 3 days for me"
mba 2020,"So I guess the upcoming 13/14"" will have the same issue."
mba 2020,"When that day comes, its going to be Apple ARM chipset.
Intel doom day is near for ultra thin laptop."
mba 2020,"Just had a chat with DHL Express - the parcel is still sitting inside a container in Chengdu after despatching from Apple's warehouse on 14 Apr. The parcel will be despatch to HK tonight 17 Apr for consolidation, before delivery to SG. Likely will be able to receive it only early next week. That will be way beyond the expected delivery date of 09 - 17 Apr."
mba 2020,Mine just says departed from the facility. 16th April. Apple site says expected to arrive by 23rd. by original dates were 16 - 24th
mba 2020,Whos excited for the macbook pro 2020?!
mba 2020,Argh my mbp 2015 died.........how how
mba 2020,Not if they keep sticking to intel
mba 2020,"isnt the new 16 inch mbp known for its good thermal performance?
Sent from Google PIXEL 2 XL using GAGT"
mba 2020,Mine arrived in singapore just now morning. Now its sitting in the dhl delivery facility since 11.30am. I think they can only send it to me on monday. But apples site is saying it will arrive wednesday.
mba 2020,"Looks like they revert back to the old 2014/5 type scissors keyboard.
My current macbook 12""'s keyboard is the butterfly type.. Such a pain to use.."
mba 2020,"Any idea how the 14 days return works during C.B Period?
My mbp 2015 died and i looking to get a replacement. But not sure if i will like the MacBook Air."
mba 2020,"do you mind explaining the return process?
same question as previous post how does the 14d return policy work during this period?"
mba 2020,I think ill just contact apple support and see what they advise me from there. If too much of a hassle maybe I can just sell it off.
mba 2020,Just get it repaired by 3rd party repairman. $300 should be your base price.
mba 2020,"Repair twice already lol. $500+ total
Repair already, one year later .. spoil"
mba 2020,"Getting my macbook air tomorrow. I really hope this new generation of apple macbooks are gonna be good. the butterfly generation was such a low point for the mac. Nothin from the 2016 - 2019 mbp line made me want to replace my 4 year old 2015 15inch macbook pro, with the exception of the 16inch mbp. Hopefully the thermal issues arent too bad."
mba 2020,"So far i've been using my mac for the past 3 weeks.
I always have Whatsapp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Visual Code Studio running.
I have Safari with 3-5 tabs, chrome with 4- 12 tabs. with video streaming on one of the tab.
I also run Adobe Illustrator / Adobe Photoshop concurrently.
So far the heat doesnt feel like a problem to me, it runs really well and able to handle all the tasks i'm using. Only really throttles when i have Netflix on running video at 1080p. while all my background tasks are still running.
im using the i7 , 16gb, 512 ssd version."
mba 2020,If you aren't use it for photo editing would be fine because the display it wasn't 100 % sRGB.
mba 2020,"i do very casual photo editing. and coming from my 2015, 15inch, I dont think that model had 100% srgb too, so it shouldnt be that big of a deal.
EDIT:
Both devices also feature True Tone display which adjusts the color temperature of your display to the environment you're in to give you a much better viewing experience. The MacBook Pro's display features P3 wide color gamut, versus the Air's sRGB so colors and contrast ratio is much better on the Pro.
Lifted from a review on Appleinsider. I think the 2016 models onwards got the P3 wide colour gamut screens. 2015 and below retinas used the regular sRGB screens. similar to the 2020 macbook air"
mba 2020,"Mine is on the same shipment as yours. And I managed to get my set yesterday, on the same day it arrives in SG."
mba 2020,You just have to pack your MacBook Air back to its original packaging and wait for DHL to come up and pick it from you.
mba 2020,"First impressions after 8 hours of use. I restored an original time machine from my old macbook pro. Took awhile and after the restore was done, the macbook air was unusable due to the indexing that was being done. After an hour or two the mac finally settled down and is quite snappy to use. HOWEVER, the fans do kick up quite abit. One thing that i do use is screen sharing on discord and this macbook air can handle screen sharing but the cpu is always at 100 degrees and the fans are at full blast when screen sharing. Quite a deal breaker honestly. I'll keep using it for now. Maybe its still indexing in the background and stuff. But so far the fans do kick in quite alot.
Tested with the i5, 16gb ram and 512gb ssd model"
mba 2020,Status of With delivery courier dated today at 10.28am means it will be delivered to my home today?
mba 2020,when e CPU is at 100 deg what's e distribution of e cores usage at? 100%?
mba 2020,"Yes, thermal performance have been improved on the 16"" but Apple increased the fan speeds, heat pipe diameter and air vent holes to compensate Intel's ""hotter"" 14nm CPUs.
This is more or less a ""damage control"" approach, and the drawback will be inevitably louder fan noises.
It appears that 2020 MacBook Air users experience louder fan noises too.
Apple has done their part. It's now Intel's turn to do the right thing, and that is to introduce 7nm chips."
mba 2020,"Okay, quick update.
This afternoon I received the MBA 2020, i5, 256gd SSD, 8gb memory.
Opened Safari with 3 tabs.
one for trading account
one for whatsapp
one for youtube / netflix
The top middle part of the keyboard gets too hot for my liking.
When I plugged in the power cable, I get static feel too.
I expect more from Apple's product.
I have arranged return and refund 15min ago.
Yup. All on the same day.
I am going to get the Dell XPS 13 2020 instead.
Mac OS was my preferred choice but it was not meant to be."
mba 2020,"yeah, im feeling the same way, coming from a 2015 mbp. This 2020 air feels really lackluster. I had 8 tabs open in safari, the mac photos app and discord open. the photos app was chugging while scrolling through and once in awhile my mac would slow to a crawl and the force touch trackpad wouldnt click for 10 seconds or so as i see the spinning beachball. Really sucks"
mba 2020,"For new macbook or new OS installed or new SSD fixed, it's normal for it to run hot as the processor is indexing. It will be normal after a day or 2 especially if you have large data transferred from the previous mac."
mba 2020,For solved static feel could use power adapter extension cable.
mba 2020,Yeah I hope thats the case. I transferred 300gb from an old time machine. The indexing appears to have finished yesterday. But Ill give it a day or two more. Another thing that I use is discord screen share. Just sharing some docs or presentations. And the laptop all 4 cores shoot up to 100 degrees within the first minute and the fan is just blaring non stop. Its really really annoying. This is also with just safari and 5 tabs open. Ive not even opened my docs or power point apps lol. And it will often just crash and beachball for 3-5 minutes while the screen sharing is going on. And I will need to hard restart it. I will upload a video soon showing the choppiness of this laptop after a fresh restart
mba 2020,"Are u saying i should let it run for 2 more days?
What is indexing?"
mba 2020,"indexing is when it needs to read and organize all the files on the computer. Normally it takes a day or two after a backup/restore. If you hit command+space, it will show indexing under the search bar as you type something. That is just the files. But the backend, normally it wont show."
mba 2020,"But i got no files to transfer/backup/restore. It is a clean slate.
So I am surprised it runs hot just by opening some basic apps."
mba 2020,"yeah to be brutally honest, i really hate this laptop now. It sits at like 70 - 100 degrees constantly while doing menial tasks. I know this is not a pro machine. But come on, 5 tabs open safari, not chrome and the mac photos app and spotify and discord and its at 85 degrees celsius and sometimes hitting 100. I cant even use discord sreenshare comfortably because the fan is just blarring doing its best to cool the cpu. Plus while the fan is at max speed, the screenshare is not even smooth. The mac gets all choppy and is just borderline useable. Coming from the 2015, 15inch, maybe i was just spoiled by that model That was the best laptop ive owned and moving from that to this, the macos experience is so much worse."
mba 2020,"Are you going to refund it?
For me, yes. Mentioned earlier too.
Already packed it inside the boxes. Waiting to be shipped back on 23 Apr."
mba 2020,Ill wait till the 12 or 13th day. I really need a laptop right now. I am for sure returning it. I really love macos but the options from apple right now are either casual use or pro use. Nothing in the middle. Hopefully when i return this the macbook pro 13inch is not too far away.
mba 2020,"after seeing your post, i feel like cancelling the order. but it just changed status to preparing to ship. lol. guess i have to receive it and then return it. rumours saying mbp releasing next month"
mba 2020,"This laptop has so much going for it, but the cooling really is a big let down. The fan is just obnoxious. Before i thought, aiya can la. Shouldnt be too bad, but the fan noise after awhile is just really annoying, think about it, 8,000rpm constantly. In general this laptop is just
fine
but nothing more. For the average user, just browsing, it would still be hard for me to recommend this laptop. Maybe get the i3 model, cause the i3 model is cooler. This laptop really fell short during screen sharing applications. Unfortunately i need it for sharing presentations and docs and it cant even comfortably do that. Its really meant for the very very basic user.
Here are some screenshots of my thermals"
mba 2020,Thank you for the feedback. Looks like my temptation died down much.
mba 2020,"its not worth the wait. I waited 3 weeks plus for this. Totally not worth it. Also, this is just my anecdote. I may have gotten a faulty model. But the thermal issues reported seem to be in line with my experience"
mba 2020,I am giving the MBA 2020 another chance to convince me...
mba 2020,"Well, I have managed to resolve the static issue by using an extension cable from my old MBP.
Heat wise, I am 50-50."
mba 2020,"thanks all for sharing informal reviews.
im surprised the thermals are like this for a new mb air product given its always supposed to be slim and cool running, furthermore with new ice lake processors.
had considered this among several laptops and ended up buying a LG gram 17z90n"
mba 2020,It is probably not designed for a quad core processor i5/i7.
mba 2020,They probably should have stick to not making the processor configurable i.e keeping it to standard i3 for all MacBook Air.
mba 2020,"Does that mean i3 can run this cooler?
Im thinking to get the very basic one for simple web surfing, extract documents from OneDrive, and chat in iMessage."
mba 2020,"The i3 will run cooler. I dont know if I can wholeheartedly recommend it. For your use case of apps that you just listed. The i3 is probably fine. But the i5 is what Id pickjust for future proofing, so that it can last and feel snappy after 2-3 years, just based off those apps."
mba 2020,Only for intensive tasks that last a very short while. Else it thermal throttle and it will be no different from i3.
mba 2020,from video reviews it doesnt throttle. just runs at e base clock cos temps too high.
mba 2020,"correct. it doesnt throttle. It runs at base clock minimum, but its always pushing the temperatures. So its just a little strange when youre browsing on safari with just 5 tabs, spotify, docs,etc and the laptop sounds like its gonna take off."
mba 2020,"Hi, I am selling it for S$1200.00 Non-Neg. Still in Good Condition. Under Warranty Till Sept 2021.
Bank Transfer only to POSB eSavings Account 421-15617-4
PM Me if you are interested. Google for Spec if you are interested to know. It is Macbook Air Year 2017 Edition."
mba 2020,"Yeah after one day of using, I think I will continue to use it for the foreseeable future. Because the heat is bearable after all. And I do want to try out Mac OS again after using windows for about 2 years. Time for a change.
Not helped by the extension of CB and the fact that XPS 13 2020 also has heat issues.
These two laptops are the only models I am looking at."
mba 2020,Seems like all the new laptops will have heat issues somehow or another.
mba 2020,"How the temp if you open few tabs in safari ?
You could check with this."
mba 2020,"It was alright. So far in all my time of use, I have not manage to hear any fan noise. I guess my tasks are not intensive enough, which is good news."
mba 2020,Usually you would hear fan noise if it reach above 80 C.
mba 2020,"Is Facebooking, YouTubing and spotifying consider heavy?
Chroming with 10 tabs running consider heavy? Will hit 80 degree?"
mba 2020,"it hit 80 easily for me with safari on 7-10 tabs, Spotify, Mac photos app and discord and email app open"
mba 2020,"is it just me or forum got some problem ?
i couldn't find the mbp 16"" thread"
mba 2020,looks like kena purged liao. there's only 1 page on e  Clinic main page n it's not there
mba 2020,"The good thing about using Apple product is that the thermal issue might get fixed by Apple through firmware updates if there are bugs causing it.
For windows manufacturer, its not so often youll see them fixing the thermal issues through firmware updates."
mba 2020,"weird ah i tot only me cannot see the thread.
i tot usually only EOL product then will remove thread ?
but this is mbp 16"" still so new ?"
mba 2020,yeah i hv accepted the mba. Called Apple to cancel the return yesterday. It is okay after all.
mba 2020,"This MBA 2020 is not worth buying at all. Just running chrome alone will cause the processor heat up to 100c.
I think topping up 300 dollars for a Macbook pro is better. Hope the 2020 MBP model gets released in may."
mba 2020,"I thought of waiting for the MBP too but decided against.
Thats because:
a cheap low end laptop with mac os
light weight laptop
i do not use cpu intensive apps
I have whatsapp, facebook, twitter, trading account, google news, edmw and etc on on Safari and I have yet to hear any fan noise.
The heat is mainly at the metal part above F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 buttons. Which I think is present at all mac laptops."
mba 2020,"Errr ok but keep in mind if it runs at 100c constantly, the laptop isn't gonna last for long."
mba 2020,"This YouTube shows it does not run at 100c all the time, even with 4k60 YouTube."
mba 2020,nope.... it does not run 100c constantly...
mba 2020,"Thats because you are using chrome 😂
Nobody uses chrome on macOS. Its one of the worse apps ever to be on macOS."
mba 2020,"Do I have a choice? Since Safari 13 all the ad-blockers are down. The remaining ones suck at blocking ads.
Firefox's zoom sucks on MacOS.
The alternative left is basically Chrome.
But the point is this, you replace chrome with iMovie, spotify, it's still going to run at close to 100c and spoil quicker. Simply because the fan isn't connected to the heatsink which is ridiculous. Even the 2015 air's heatsink is connected."
mba 2020,"You have alternative, which is to use Edge Chromium. Same as chrome but much better security.
And MacBook Air is not the only laptop to have thermal issue with this chip. The inherent issues come with Intel who has poorly designed a poor chip.
Anyhow, you might want to return your unit and get another one to make sure you didnt get a lemon."
mba 2020,what do u mean adblockers r down?
mba 2020,u prob did not finish reading e article?  just changed e backend. I'm still using AdGuard for Safari n it's working.
mba 2020,That's false. I have been using Safari for 5 years with AdBlocker on. It still runs flawlessly today with the latest version. Safari is overall a more fluid experience than Chrome. I only use Chrome if I want to stream 4K or 8K Videos on YouTube; features that aren't available on Safari.
mba 2020,How long usually take from Processing to Preparing to ship?
mba 2020,Same here. I have adbplus running in safari. And safari uses less power than chrome. I also use Chrome only when need 4k YouTube. Too bad no 4k Netflix.
mba 2020,"yup. i use safari 90% of the time. i use wipr as my adblocker.
anyways to anyone looking to pick this macbook air up, if your use case is only basic stuff. a few tabs, music/spotify, email. This laptop is fine. The temps are just too high for my liking for menial tasks and the fan is just annoying. For a company that usually loves to market their products as silent and thin and light, them not including a heatpipe to prevent the fans from spinning up too much is just weird. I understand the design of the fan, as it is acting more as a case fan than a direct CPU fan, however just adding a heatpipe would have cooled the CPU so much better and allowed it to stretch its legs more. The laptop stutters alot for me too. Sometimes i wake the laptop up in the morning, my apps are stuttering. I dont know if this is a catalina issue or a macbook air issue. But my 2015, 15inch macbook pro didnt have this issue. In my 6 days of using this laptop, its given me more issues than my 2015, 15inch has in 4 years. I would really recommend waiting for the 13inch macbook pro refresh. Even if its just a keyboard refresh and nothing more, I would still recommend you to wait haha. Its rumored to be in may. The prices will stay the same probably but the storage will be doubled. So you could probably get a 256gb/8gb mbp13 for maybe S$2199.

As off right now, on the apple singapore store, the 2thunderbolt 3 model with 128gbssd and 8gb ram is $1899, 256gb ssd model is $2199. Im gonna guess that they will be making the macbook pro 13 all come standard with 4 thunderbolt 3 ports to differentiate it from the macbook air. So my guess would be a new 13inch model with 256gb ssd and 8gb ram for 2199. or at most $2299.
That gives it a wide enough gap in terms of price vs the $1449 MBA 2020 and far enough from the base $3499 16inch mbp. As for me I will be aiming for a 512gb and 16gb model. Hopefully that will be priced at $2599 or $2699
Also keep in mind, if you watch alot of youtubers doing all these benchmakrs and testing of temperatures. Please remember that their ambient temperatures is very different from ours. We are always in humid 29 - 33 degree weather. Thats why their temperatures are almost never consistent. Got one youtuber say 90, one say 100, one say 75. Its so varied that i feel like they're not talking about the same laptop even. They all fail to point that ambient temperature plays a part too."
mba 2020,"hey guys i have received my quadcore i5 256gb mba 2020 today. while upgrading the os to its latest version, i do feel the top part of the keyboard area about f4 to f8 getting hot for a while but it didn't last long.
playing youtube videos and surfing 3 tabs so far .. temperature feels fine.
havent hear any fan noise yet
i am going to test this with more heavy browsing to see how it goes before deciding to get a refund or not.
not thinking of moving my stuff over from my 2011 mbp as i prefer a clean state."
mba 2020,"Yeah its good to have more real local reviews rather than those foreign youtuber s.
The MacBook Pro might be coming out in May but the price highly be in the high side of the thousand at least so might not be everyone budget.
Can see that most of the guys here are getting the i5, how about the ram? 8gb or 16gb?"
mba 2020,The hardware is the same here or overseas. The difference is in the weather and usage pattern.
mba 2020,"Depending on your usage. 8GB RAM is enough if you are a light user, mainly using it for surfing, video streaming, emails and word/data processing.
Youll only need 16GB RAM if you open a lot of tabs, big excel files and a little bit of photo/ videos editing."
mba 2020,"the more i think about it, the more the 16gb ram does not make sense to me. In a laptop where the cpu is easily pushed, I dont think 16gb ram will ever be needed as the cpu is more likely gonna bottleneck your workflow before you can even reach 16gb ram usage. Because the most tabs i had open was 18 and the laptop was quite choppy already. 18 tabs safari, discord, spotify. I would recommend 8gb ram and i3/i5. Probably i3 as it runs cooler.
If you get the i3 model with 8gb ram and 256gb ssd its only 1,449. For a macbook air in 2020 that is a pretty good deal.
Also to add on to my post earlier. The battery is actually not that great compared to the old macbook airs of past. In my testing, i think 6 - 8 hours at 50% brightness.
After researching abit, the older macbook airs had 6,800mah batteries while this one only has 4,400. Quite the drop in capacity even if the processors are more power efficient."
mba 2020,"Hi guys,
Thinking of getting the base model i3, 8gb ram, 256gb ssd.
Usage will mostly be low end productivity excel, word, casual surfing with a few tabs open, plus youtube & netflix when I stream stuff, I don't usually open a lot of tabs.
I don't do any photo/video-editing, or any type of CPU intensive stuff. Have a dedicated laptop for gaming and more intensive stuff, so this MBA is really for portability and also trying out MacOS for the first time.
Read/watched videos about the high temps and got a little concerned. Will I be alright with my stated use-case?
Thanks!"
mba 2020,Your case will be alright. You dont even need that extra 128GB.
mba 2020,cpu not fully utilized doesnt mean ram wont be used. e more apps/tabs u have opened e more ram it will use. more ram is always better than less ram
mba 2020,"Copied from somewhere;
RAM is the size of the desk, but the processor is the person sitting at the desk."
mba 2020,anyone can advice what app is this? thanks.
mba 2020,Thanks!
mba 2020,"Got a MBA 2020 i5 8GB 512GB for my secondary school kid. She uses Microsoft office, zoom meetings, Skype, web browsing and watching youtube and anime.
No fan or heating issues. Everything felt snappy. I read the reviews and was a bit worried but ended up with no problems at all."
mba 2020,I would have traded that 512GB for additional 8GB if RAM. I believe she needs more RAM than storage capacity.
mba 2020,"8GB is more than enough for normal tasks. I have 8GB on my Mac mini 2018 and Im doing  the occasional video editing with it.
My 2011 mba with 4gb ram is also still working well, though a bit slow nowadays. Haha."
mba 2020,i got this static issue. do you mean you use your old mbp charging cable? any suggestion for those who don't have thunderbolt 3 cable
mba 2020,"I am using this:
Use the above to connect to your 30W USB-C Power Adapter.
Viola~~"
mba 2020,"Looking for laptop to replace my 2011 mba. Saw mixed reviews.
Basically I m using laptop purely for web browsing , word processor , YouTube.
Will 8gig ram n 265gig disk be sufficient?
I m still undecided whether to get the current mba due to heating issue.
Any advise?"
mba 2020,Your usage will be fine with the config. Just go ahead.
mba 2020,"Thanks bro, just saw the delivery date in May"
mba 2020,"try lazada that has discounts for apple products right now. however, they sell only the standard models."
mba 2020,"didn't notice the heat issues but my Mac does throttle bit when I overload it with my adobe cc stuff running. I do have video streams on and a lot of background apps running, but I will consider upgrading to the new MacBook Pro if my usage increases."
mba 2020,"My MacBook Air 2017 has excellent sturdy keyboard. Better than the latest version of all MacBook Air from 2018 onwards... if you intend to use keyboard for a long time, consider mine... this is not a sales method to sell my MacBook Air 2017, check review online regarding MacBook Air 2017 keyboard and it will tell you it is a durable keyboard. PM me if you are interested to buy..."
mba 2020,this is not a sales thread dude
mba 2020,Apple is using the new scissors keyboard in the mba 2020 which should fix all the 2018/2019 keyboard issues.
mba 2020,"Anyone here using MacBook Air 2020 for programming purposes like Xcode, Android Studio or Unity?"
mba 2020,Yeah I didn't do that and you are probably right as data storage all on cloud. I was lazy and picked the predefined config and didn't try to customise. Oh well never mind. Still good.
mba 2020,"Is it worth getting the Air 2020 for light RAW photo editing and abit of graphic design. Thinking of speccing it out with i5,16GB RAM and 512GB SSD.
I just sold off my 15 inch 2016 version due to weight and prefer to downgrade to 13 inches screen."
mba 2020,it is not even close to 100% P3 gamut. will this affect ur editing?
mba 2020,Not really as I'm not doing it professionally.
mba 2020,Or wait for the new 13 Pro in May?
mba 2020,Reporting in. What answer are you seeking?
mba 2020,"Depending on the news I am considering of returning the MacBook Air for the Pro
Overall the day to day usage for me has been relatively good. Battery life can last me from 8am to 10pm 1130 - 2pm no usage before needing to charge again."
mba 2020,That's another option but I'm assuming it'll cost around 3K when I specced it the way I want
mba 2020,Hmm... I would say you just need to upgrade the RAM to 16GB and stick with 256GB of storage. The processor for the new base model MBP13 is definitely better than the one in MBA13.
mba 2020,Hows the performance when doing development in particular running Android emulator which is always slow.
mba 2020,I think u should go for the Pro.
mba 2020,"I agree with plsbanthem instead of a 13 u should get the 16.
Running the emulator eats up a lot of processor power and gets really hot on my MBA hovering around temp of 80~90 degrees. I usually run the emulator on my desktop instead as I feel if I continue running it might just fry the circuit board in the long run."
mba 2020,"Will you be getting the 16"" after returning this MBA 2020? I read that the 16"" also has thermal issue."
mba 2020,"I think the current build for all the new MacBooks will have thermal issues. Not sure if it was deliberate or not, but I would wait a little longer to see if the new pros that is rumoured to be out this mod this month.
Will wait for it to be stripped down before deciding as my MBA 2020 is max specced. I probably wont feel much of a difference if it was the new pro.
Unless they introduce a dedicated graphics for it."
mba 2020,"Dedicated graphic will only be on the 16""..."
mba 2020,Dedicated graphics will have its own issue due to the automatic switching.
mba 2020,"Ordered the 2020 almost 2 wks ago. Still processing. With the China golden week now, dunno when will deliver. Haha."
mba 2020,ah... mine took 20 days to arrive from when I ordered. It does take awhile to deliver. Just checked the apple site and wow it is still at 2 weeks+ estimates
mba 2020,I meant for an equal sized macbook. Wont be lugging around a 16 just for coding. If I need media editing capabilities I rather use a desktop for it compiles much faster.
mba 2020,Thats so weird. I ordered my base spec mba 2020 on 26 apr. Delivered in 2 days. Shipment was was already in singapore according to order tracking
mba 2020,mine is customized. i changed the i3 to i5.
mba 2020,New MacBook Pro 13 announced!
mba 2020,"My i5 MBA's temperatures have consistently stay in 50 degree cel.
Can go as low at 37 if not doing anything, as high as 55 when i running some simple apps."
mba 2020,"New MacBook Pro announced but not much of an upgrade for me. I will just stick to my MBA instead. Im already using an i7 , 16gb RAM, 512gb SSD. The only difference is the screen display."
mba 2020,So you will be keeping it to do development?
mba 2020,"not only that.
for processing intensive tasks, MBP will have a greater advantage.
MBP also has better speakers, touch bar.
price gap between MBA and MBP is not significant."
mba 2020,Anyone knows what's the maximum WiFi speed? Is it 866 Mbps?
mba 2020,I believe for MacBook Air the antenna should be 3x3 MIMO so maximum speed on AC should be 1300Mbps but you wont achieve this speed anyway.
mba 2020,"The processor used is different. MBA is using the Y series while 13 Pro is using the U series. MBP gives you more processing power and also faster RAM.
Oh did I mention better thermal design? Yeah so all will result in faster and more stable performance."
mba 2020,"oh, isn't the ram same speed 3733mhz for both? and also mbp has fan to the cpu heatsink. I think apple purposely leave this out on the MBA so that it is not even close to competing with the pros."
mba 2020,"Yes my bad. I was comparing between the base model. But between both 10th Gen models of MBA and MBP, the RAM speed is the same."
mba 2020,I tried zoom with my macbook air today.. OMFG.. the Camera is absolutely Rubbish.. its so grainy.. its like 10 years ago technology.
mba 2020,The camera is still 720p.
mba 2020,"both MBA 2020 and MBP 2020 are still using 720p camera. No comparison there.
10th Gen MBA vs 10th Gen MBP.
RAM : No difference
PROCESSOR : MBA -Y processor vs MBP -U processor - probably.
SSD: No difference
GPU : Both Intel Iris Plus
The only difference is when there is a real teardown to see how the internals are built for MBP. And definitely a Y processor cannot compare to a U processor.
MBA2020 definitely has heat issues because of the Fan placement wonder why did Apple hire such subpar engineers that designed the placement. Oh was the design engineer on drugs?"
mba 2020,"Based on the above same spec, the price different is how much?"
mba 2020,"Plan to get the i5, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD... Think can only get from Apple Online Store...
Does Apple Online Store have promotions?"
mba 2020,"education discount
or if your company have EPP/CIS with apple.
Posted with iPhone 11 Pro Max HardwareZone Forums app"
mba 2020,"Not necessarily. If you are getting the 10th Gen CPU, the specs you wanted is the base model.
It will be available from authorized reseller too."
mba 2020,Tot standard configuration is with 8GB RAM only I go check again
mba 2020,8GB base model is for the 8th Gen processor.
mba 2020,"Err Here is topic for MBA 2020, where got 8th Gen processor? 😝"
mba 2020,Haha sorry bro my bad. I thought this thread is about MBP13
mba 2020,"$2429 for MBA i7
$2699 for MBP i5
$2999 for MBP i7"
mba 2020,Anyone here still planning to get MacBook Air as opposed to MacBook Pro?
mba 2020,"really torn between getting a MacBook Air base model i3 or a MacBook Pro base model. Just worried about the thermals in mba but also dont really like the fact that mbp base model is still i8, any kind souls would like to advise? Its just for some emails, words documents , socials and Netflix usage"
mba 2020,"I hv the MBA 2020 and can vouch for its capacity to perform your listed activities without issue. Price wise is much lower than MBP too.
And most impt for me is lightest weight amongst the current lineup."
mba 2020,"Been using MBA i3 2020 for more than a week and have not experienced any thermal issue and lagging. Mainly using it for streaming youtube, whatsapping web version, microsoft office, emailing, surfing websites etc. The i3 model is the most bang for buck Macbook i ever bought since 2017! The same improved magic keyboard and speaker, newer RAM and processor if compared to base MBP 13 2020."
mba 2020,Do you experience any lags if day you open 5tabs and Netflix at the same time?
mba 2020,"Thanks bro, did you encounter any laggish performance if you were to open multiple tabs and Netflix At the same time for example."
mba 2020,"Just did a check for u and i still do not encounter any lags with 5 tabs opened and streaming youtube （set at 1080 in the background. Also tried switching to microsoft word and excel time to time and back to webpages and youtube. So far no lags and have not heard fan noise since day one. Base of MBA is slightly warm but not abnormally warm or hot.
*no Netflix account so can only test on youtube and mewatch ."
mba 2020,thanks bro! appreciate it
mba 2020,So far I have not encounter the rainbow wheel.
mba 2020,"MacBook Air base model i3 is good enough but better upgrade ram to 16 GB.
You could see review in here."
mba 2020,Just to point out the upgrade of RAM for base model MBP is half price compared to MacBook Air.
mba 2020,"But upgrading to a 16gb ram instead , will it ever fulfill its potential? I mean wont it start to throttle because of mba thermals issue, you probably wont even reach 16gb by then."
mba 2020,"Thanks bro, most likely getting the base model for some light normal usage"
mba 2020,"Now using mbp with 8 gb ram and open 10 tabs it taken around 6 gb.
If you like open many tabs and app it better to have 16 gb ram."
mba 2020,do u feel the heat when u used the air on your lap?
mba 2020,"I have also been using the I3 macbook air for 1 week now. I was using the 2017 macbook pro base version prior to switching to this. The macbook pro was giving me some problems so i thought better to get rid of it and buy this chio-er macbook air.
So fast so good. Love the keyboard and love the new rose gold colour!
the only downside is the front facing camera. really poor. No overheating issues yet!"
mba 2020,Wah now very torn i3 8gb or 16gb ram
mba 2020,"Recommend my MacBook Air 2017
Spec:
1.8Ghz Intel Core i5
8GB Ram
I am selling it at $1200.00.  8GB is more than enough..."
mba 2020,Maybe you would choose mbp after see this review.
mba 2020,Yeah MBP higher end model has 2 fans which is linked to cpu. Much better.
mba 2020,"Just like I said earlier in this thread, the thermal problem with the macbook air just makes it ""not recommended"". And in 2-3 years time, with regular updated OS, updated programs, more high intensity web surfing, more video calls, this machine just will not cut it. Constantly letting the macbook air running at high temperature will compromise the logic board."
mba 2020,I would recommend MacBook Pro if you are doing Video Editing most of the time.
mba 2020,Is MacBook Air worth the $400 saving? Would be getting it on the education store.
mba 2020,"Is 8gb ram or 16gb ram better for mba?
Cos the upgrade is $270 and Im not sure how to fully utilised 16gb ram?
If I open a lot of apps or tabs, I will be using the ram more but wouldnt the mba be trottling more heat and slowing down the performance?
I can understand the upgrade from base model i3 to i5, mainly its cheap $150. But not sure about the ram???
Any seniors views on this?"
mba 2020,"If you open a lot of apps or tabs better to choose mbp. You could read review of this website and look section of "" System Performance  MacBook Air fast enough for basic tasks ""
They said However, you should not do too much multitasking or use too many browser tabs at the same time, otherwise you can notice some slight stutters. The MacBook Air is hardly suited for power users anyway, and this is also the case for the more expensive SKUs with quad-core CPUs. The MacBook Pro 13 is a much better device for more demanding applications, for example."
mba 2020,"8GB is more than enough for normal usage. You need more if doing video/photo editing, playing games, doing huge spreadsheets, which all these activities are harsh on the MBA, ie. not recommended unless u like to hear the fans spinning loudly all the time.
My MBA 2011 has only 4GB RAM and my child can still use it for the HBL."
mba 2020,"if open 8-10 tabs  and running ms office in the background, 8gb ram is suffice?"
mba 2020,"If your tabs are on Safari and not playing videos in every tab, should be more than enough."
mba 2020,For MacBook Air 2020 with i3 and 8 gb ram would it smoothly using chrome opened 20 tabs ?
mba 2020,"Depends on the sites as well. If you are playing videos, then probably even i7 cannot take it."
mba 2020,"Why would u need to open 20 tabs at a time??? What are you micro-managing?
Thats too over hahaha
As said, even i7 or I think Mbp also got difficulties in running smoothly"
mba 2020,"IMHO, it's worth the pain. You'll not feel a need to upgrade for the lifespan of the Mac. And you won't be able to anyway.."
mba 2020,u can if u like listening to the full force of the fan. haha...
mba 2020,"In MacBook Pro 2017 with i5 dual core and 8 gb able to do it smoothly.
I mean smoothly visit each tabs in chrome."
mba 2020,Anyone knows when Apple Store is reopening
mba 2020,at least till the CB is released.
mba 2020,"New macbook air 13 2020 inner lcd crack, heart broken  what happened to Apple products? why it is so fragile, my children just played around, why ???
newly bought and received at the beginning of May 2020"
mba 2020,"it is always somebody's fault, not yours, right?"
mba 2020,"You mean other brands of laptop can withstand your children's ""playing around""?
Typical sinkie... blame everything else but themselves.
And nope, you can forget about Apple helping you for this."
mba 2020,Oouch.....
mba 2020,"how your children play around ?
jump on it ?"
mba 2020,"I'm thinking of getting the MBA i5 16gb ram. My daily usage will be zooms with occasional screen sharing. about 15 tabs - mixture of multiple emails, youtube in safari and chrome. 2-3 excel sheets in the background. Can it handle without the high temps and fans to max?"
mba 2020,"Go get yourself a base MBP instead.
I returned my MBA i5 8gb after a few days. Its really good at blowing out a lot of hot air, and not to mention the jet engine noise when the fan is running at full speed.
Running zoom with screen sharing is too taxing for MBA."
mba 2020,"Hi, wanna ask for opinions on MBA 2020. I am gonna study BSc Cyber Security & Forensics and i think there are some modules that requires some coding work. May i ask if MBA is good enough or i should get MBP base model or i should get a Windows laptop like the Surface Laptop 3 I think the coding programs are in Windows environment and using a Macbook runnin Windows is a waste of $$$."
mba 2020,"If u cannot switch mindset then just go with surface.
There are definitely some unique programs for Windows only but there is always alternatives to the solutions with MAC.
Use what u feel will cause u less problems for ur studies. I personally use a MAC because its easier for me."
mba 2020,"Why not you first find out which are the softwares are used in the course you mentioned ? Also why not you also find out from the institute admin office, suppose if you are using Mac, will using a Mac impede your learning where software is incompatible across the OS.
Like the earlier post, it is hard to imagine these days in the software engineering perspective where a Mac will hinder. In a lot of cases, cyber security courses may touch on Linux/Unix software too, then how ? Get a Linux box ? Virtual machine will be your option.
MBA will be good enough, but good enough is subjective. For me, I will think a 13"" MBP might benefit you more. These are your options."
mba 2020,"Anyone extend their display to a monitor? What adaptor are your guys using? Can I check do we need to plug in the power adaptor while displaying to monitor. My worry is that if we keep plugging the power to the display adaptor, will it eventually spoilt the MacBook Air battery."
mba 2020,"Using MBP 15, if your MBA has USB-C, you can choose the following
USB-C To Dell U2720Q
Power just to monitor. The rest of the connectivity for data, video, audio, power between the laptop and monitor is via the single USB-C cable
The latest Mac OS X will attempt not to fully charge the battery even if you are plug in all the time. This is Apple attempt to help length the lifespan of the Lithium matters. In any case Lithium battery cannot be overcharged under normal usage perimeter because any proper design would have to control the voltage of the battery properly for it to be safe."
mba 2020,"ok. thanks! manage to connect it without plugging in the usb c cable, use the 2nd port and it was working fine without power adaptor. only when battery is low then i plug in. now my setup is complete!"
mba 2020,I think refurbished unit should be hitting the store soon.
mba 2020,"Just received my MacBook Air 2020 yesterday and encountered the below issue.
Whole computer will hang suddenly for like 30s then screen will power off. Followed by about 2s of fan spinning at what seems like max speed. After that it will restart and boot up normally with a pop out stating macbook had encountered a problem.
Happened at least once yesterday and today. Any idea what happened? Should I initiate a return? Thanks"
mba 2020,Less than 1 week old? Yeah ask for replacement

mbp 2020,The new updated MacBook Pro 13 2020 with scissor switch is out!
mbp 2020,Nice! Finally better keyboards.
mbp 2020,"2.0GHz version is Intel 10th Gen~
while base model is 8th Gen~
Limit 5 per customer.
interesting. now is the wait for 10th Gen for 16""~"
mbp 2020,"Yes you are right. SG$800 more for a newer, faster processor, 2x faster RAM, double the storage and 2 additional TB3 ports. I think its worth it."
mbp 2020,"Education price is attractive
Posted from Hell B18 HardwareZone Forums app"
mbp 2020,"It is cheaper than before with upgraded spec.
Base model with two ports all get cheaper. Same price you can double storage than before.
4 ports model you get double storage and double ram than befor."
mbp 2020,yup! the estimates were correct. the $2699 model comes with 512gb ssd and 16gb ram. before this price only got you 256gb ssd and 8gb ram. Great savings across the board. Plus you get new processors and a decent keyboard.
mbp 2020,Faster RAM and storage too.
mbp 2020,Yes correct more worth it to get that.
mbp 2020,"Sad to see that they didnt size up the screen to 14 inches, oh wells..."
mbp 2020,"Where is the 14”?
But this time round the mbp quite cheap lay.
When I bought my tb 2016 13”, spent over 3k plus for 16gb n 512ssd."
mbp 2020,Website laggy...
mbp 2020,"Yes MacBook Pro are getting cheaper. This is similar to 2015 MacBook Pro which it is the lowest price point to get a MacBook Pro that time. After 2016 redesign, price increases again. now in the 4th year of the redesign, price becomes another new Low.
I spent $2780 for my MBP 2017 also with 512gb storage and 16GB. 4 ports Touch Bar version.
Now only cost $2549."
mbp 2020,"It's cheaper now cos Apple is preparing for new design with Mini LED later this year.
14"" and 16"" and and 12"" with ARM chip next year."
mbp 2020,"Likely to have a new redesign and with ARM chip.
Initially my MacBook Pro 2017 is facing some issues with ghosting problem on the display.
Surprisingly, now it is solved by itself.
I sent in to Apple authorised dealer to diagnose but they said no issue can be found. However, if I were to replace the display, it costed $1k++ with display replacement fee and diagnosis fee.
Lucky I did not opt for it."
mbp 2020,sweet! wait for thermal tests before deciding to get or not
mbp 2020,Nice to see that the price is cheaper comparatively since it's the 5th year of roughly the same redesign. But no 14 inch display
mbp 2020,its cheaper because apple has finally decided to double the storage and ram. thats it. you are paying $600 less than before. it was quite ridiculous that some 4tb port models in 2016- 2018 started at 128gb and costs $300 to upgrade to 256 and another 300 for 512. Ram is also $300 more for 8 - 16gb upgrade. If you checked the 2019 13 inch macbook pros. it costs 3.2k to get 512gb ssd and 16gb ram. now the same variant is 2699 sgd.
mbp 2020,"16gb RAM and 512GB SSD
Worth it lor"
mbp 2020,Yes. It is ridiculously cheaper than before.
mbp 2020,"That’s because of the new touch bar feature. When I got my mid 2015 MBP, was the flagship model at only $3.3k+ 2.5GHz, 16GB RAM, 512GB. What I really miss about the models from 2016 onwards is the illuminated Apple logo.
I’m still using it now, still going strong."
mbp 2020,"Yes it is the touchbar that makes the price up.
Personally I prefer the scissor keyboard on my MBP 2017.
MBP is known to be lasting seriously. One can easily use it for close to 10 years even."
mbp 2020,"My 2015 one is also scissors type. This is my second MBP as my first was the 2010 one in which shortly after the 5-year mark, GPU failed causing the MBP to auto shutdown and reboot everytime the graphic card switches. I’ve a colleague still using his old MBA which is nearly 10 years old, probably the first model
I might continue to use my current one until it also gives up, but also might be needing a batt change first as capacity is down to around 84%.
Will see next year’s MBP models as rumoured to be ARM-based."
mbp 2020,When will it be available for purchase?
mbp 2020,MBP wont go ARM. It will be a ultra portable which will be going ARM.
mbp 2020,"10th gen pricing damn not worth it. Refurb mbp16 base model is slightly under $3k, compared to mbp13 10th gen 2.7k. Though now it is out of stock"
mbp 2020,How much cheaper?
mbp 2020,"Wow. Think I might get this after a year of using Windows with Lenovo mainly for gaming. My DBS corporate promo is about 20-30 dollars cheaper than the education promo Lol.
I think the price is really not bad for the specs. I'm still digging the date design."
mbp 2020,"no wifi 6
no 14"" display
looks like my 13"" late 2013 doesnt need upgrading yet"
mbp 2020,Still not able to order.
mbp 2020,no news. surprisingly lion city is not in the first batch list for the new macbook pro 13-inch.
mbp 2020,"also btw, keep in mind if you are after performance and want the best in thermals, the 4 thunderbolt model is alot different internally compared to the 2 thunderbolt model.
This is the internals of the 2 thunderbolt model

This is the internals of the 4 thunderbolt model

The 4 thunderbolt model have better speakers, better thermals, bigger battery though the battery is very small in difference from 54.5w to 58w and if im not wrong better microphones.
Additionally, the CPU in these devices are different in terms of their wattage. the 2 thunderbolt model is only 15watts vs the 25-28watts on the 4 thunderbolt models. This equals more performance, thats why the 2 thuderbolt model starts at 1.4ghz processor vs the 2.0ghz on the 4thunderbolt models
The better thermals is NOT just because of the 2 fans, but the chassis design too. If you are familiar with the 2012-2015 retinas, the bottom of the macbook pro theres 2 slits at the edges for additional airflow.

The 2 thunderbolt port macbook pro is more reminiscent of the macbook air. The intake and exhaust is all in the hinge of the macbook.
I hope this helps your purchase decision when it comes to the pros. I returned my 2020 macbook air due to the heat issues i was facing with the laptop. If you are contemplating a macbook air instead of the pro. It really depends on what you will be doing/your workflow. The macbook air is fine if you are using just for spotify, social media, emails, netflix. But thats it. Anything more it will start to heat up and the fans will kick in. High temperatures and loud fan noises is what made me return it. Now with how we are working from home due to covid-19, i noticed the computer start to stutter with just video call and safari and maybe my word application open. When I tried to screen share, the laptop just slows to a crawl with the fans at max speed and temps at 100 degrees.
If you really want the air, get the base model with i3, at SGD$1,449 for a modern 2020 macbook, its a good deal. the i3 version has better thermals compared to the i5. If you do pick the i5, its already at SGD$1,599. I would really recommend you to get the base model macbook pro for SGD$1,799. The thermals alone is worth it imo. Dont be fooled by the spec sheet of the macbook air with its 10th generation i5, that i5 processor performs worse compared to the 8th generation i5s found in the macbook pro due to the thermal constraints of the macbook air."
mbp 2020,I guess should be very soon. The MacBook Air is available for order within 24 hours or so after announcement.
mbp 2020,@MilgaussSC very good info
mbp 2020,one of the best posts i've seen in this forum in YEARS. kudos man!
mbp 2020,"Thanks for the insightful post.
I ordered the MBA with i5 and am returning it because of the constant high temps 100C and more than >8000 rpm fan noise. I have attempted to use turbo switcher to turn off turbo boost but the program does not work all the time. This is based on just using light surfing of internet Youtube and playing videos and the fan speed and temps will go up.
May I know which MBP are you planning to get? Will you be getting the 10th gen 13 inch MBP for the better thermals? My concern is that the 8th gen 13 inch MBP may have similar thermal issues like the MBA."
mbp 2020,were u using Safari or other browser?
mbp 2020,"I will be getting the 10th gen variant. Either with 16gb ram, 512gb and i7, or the 16gb ram, 1tb and i5. I’m waiting on reviews for the i5 vs i7. I want a laptop to last me 4 years minimum. My old 15 inch 2015 lasted me 4 years++ without any issues.
As for you concern, there are plenty of reviews of the 8th gen variant. Just search 2019 13inch base model MacBook Pro 13. Many YouTube videos of it. It’s essentially the same laptop only with the removal of the butterfly keys and double the storage"
mbp 2020,"i'm wondering if apple will pull the same stunt they did last year....release a 15"" in and then the 16"" in nov.
i am in the market for a new laptop and like you i'm just keeping an eye out on the reviews in the days to come....really wished the rumours were true about the 14"""
mbp 2020,"I am using Chrome. I have also read that many people that doesn't face the thermal and fan issues while using Safari. However, if my i5 MBA cannot handle basic Youtube in Chrome or playing videos requiring constant 100C and >8000rpm fan speeds, then I am not sure if I should continue using it perhaps my MBA is a faulty set, or Chrome is the culprit here.
There was also one night where the fan kept running at full speed the noise is evidently loud despite the lid being closed I believe I only had the Chrome browser kept open.
Like many others, I decided to ignore the fan noise and use it for a few days but it gets annoying at times even at low or mild usage of web browsing no gaming or photo/video editing on the MBA. After using the MBA for 14 days, I guess returning the MBA would be the best option. I have 3 other older Macbooks 2 Macbook Pros and 1 Macbook and never experienced such loud fan speed noises for simple or light use of applications.
The i3 MBA may fare better from fan noise and thermal issues, but I can't comment personally since I don't own one. Planning to replace the MBA with the new 13 MBP, hopefully I won't face similar thermal/fan noise issues.
Same here, will also wait for more reviews to come out. My main concern is with the thermals and fan noise issues, hopefully this ain't the problem with the improved thermals of the MBP as compared to the MBA."
mbp 2020,"Yup, I pretty much experience the same thing as you. I understand what Apple is doing with the macbook air cooling design, the fan is NOT a CPU fan, its more of a case fan. Think of an exhaust fan at the back of a tower desktop. However, I can't help but feel that a heat pipe would have been so much better. But what do I know.
I want a macbook that will last me 3 - 5 more years, with the air always at 70 - 100 degrees constantly, I doubt it will last that long. Also, I thought I could tolerate the fan noise too. Initially, I was I thought the fan was not too bad. But after a while, when I'm just video calling and browsing on safari, the fans are at 5000 - 7000rpm. It's just annoying. Also, I experienced that issue with you where I closed the lid overnight. The next morning when I woke it up, it was uncomfortably hot. I only had discord and safari open. That's it.
Another thing I would like to mention is regarding touch id on the macbook air. It doesn't work half the time!! I don't know if it's just my unit or what, but touch id on it is really hit or miss. Maybe the thing is just stuttering or something and struggling to keep up with processes."
mbp 2020,"hey you mention that the internal of 2 Thunderbolt model of mbp look similiar to the mba, then why do advise to go for the mbp instead of the mba when it cost more? won't it have the same thermal issue if that's the case?
i got until the 9 May to decide whether to return my i5 mba 2020 lol.
touch id is working fine for me. i use brave browser instead of safari and chrome."
mbp 2020,"The cooling in terms of exhaust and intake is similar. The intake and exhaust are both at the hinge. HOWEVER, the 13inch 2 thunderbolt port has a heatpipe connected to the heatsink. Makes a big difference.
The 4 thunderbolt model intakes air from the slots at the bottom of the chassis and exhausts it at the hinge.
If lets say youre happy with your i5 air, you can keep it. There are use cases where the i5 makes sense. $200 is quite substantial in savings. You might not need the additional performance from the pros. If youd like to know more about the $1,799 pro, check reviews of the 2019 MacBook Pro.
Heres a comparison of the MacBook Pro 2019 2 thunderbolt its the same as the 2020 2 thunderbolt, except the keyboard and storage had been upgraded. Jump to 7 mins in the video

mbp 2020,hmm how did u get e internals of e 4port mbp? I thought nobody has it yet
mbp 2020,i believe he is referencing existing 2TB/4TB port models man.
mbp 2020,Can order le. Delivery date from 11/5 for base model and 15/5 for mid n end model.
mbp 2020,The rumour about 14 still stand true. It will be a complete redesign along with a new 12 ARM and 16.
mbp 2020,"what im deciding now is, wait for a refurb 16"" to appear or get the 16/512 13""
i need one to tide me till the 14"" comes outs. lol.
i do prefer lighter laptops but the 16"" refurb is just a smarter purchase at the expense of my shoulders....hmmm"
mbp 2020,"Thinking about this decision as well. My mbp 2014 15"" battery died again yesterday OEM replaced once already
Time for a change."
mbp 2020,"Interestingly, no one has a review unit yet."
mbp 2020,Of cos its its not officially launched yet. Apple sent out the review units as soon as announcement was made.
mbp 2020,"Are you the Jon prosser of HWZ?
Haha.
Just really wondering if the 14 will be out this year...anyones guess"
mbp 2020,you will see reviews out when the mbp is shipping. can't wait to see the reviews to kill the #stayathome time. haha...
mbp 2020,How come need to kill time? Dont you need to work? Employer pay you not to sleep hor.
mbp 2020,"For popular YouTubers, they usually have the unit for a week or so before  the announcement."
mbp 2020,"Not for every product. Even then, they can only post when embargo is lifted."
mbp 2020,"Curious if boot cAmp to win10
Will the key road affected Id wee need to use Windowss key broad command"
mbp 2020,???????
mbp 2020,So who ordered already?
mbp 2020,any different from 2018 model other than keyboard?
mbp 2020,You mean 2018 Touch Bar model or non-touch bar model?
mbp 2020,"year yr will have new model Har.. then I dont buy first Liao lol
Will use ipad as my main. And use windows laptop to download stuff"
mbp 2020,"Waiting for reviews of the thermals and performance before i order one.
This is the internals of the 2019 models, but the 2016 - 2019 models have had identical internals. With the 2020 2 thunderbolt macbook pro being just a keyboard swap, it most likely will have identical internals.
The 4 thunderbolt port models have always shipped with 28watt processors and the 2 fan design is the only way apple can cool that 28watt processor efficiently in a 13inch chassis.
I would be shocked if the internals arent similar in this new 2020 model"
mbp 2020,"Although price is tempting but I think my 2016 tb still going strong for remote access, parallels and entertainment. Just that duno why the coating on screen disappear. Oil stain can’t clean off.
Guess shall wait for 14” de."
mbp 2020,student? haha...
mbp 2020,"can i just confirm that applecare for macbooks, you must buy within a year from date of purchase?"
mbp 2020,Best to get together else u might forget. Like me... twice i forget to buy before end of 12 month!
mbp 2020,Some interesting info about the ice lake chips in the new MacBook pros.
mbp 2020,"AppleCare+ is within 60 days.
AppleCare Protection Plan is within 12 months."
mbp 2020,You are right. Apple always has limited exclusivity to their CPU and GPU before anyone else and a few of the CPU models will only be exclusive to Apple.
mbp 2020,"I like this youtuber's review, tips, comparisons and advice. Very detail and straight to the point. Now waiting for his benchmark comparisons."
mbp 2020,"As in if I will go install windows on MAC
Will the MAC keybroad affect mine windows Short cuts like
Control C
Control X
Control Z"
mbp 2020,"I've been thinking to get between the new MBA and the MBP... But seems like alot of people are having issues with the fans and overheating!
Anyone can recommend which configuration I should get? I occasionally work with datasets, so will use MATLAB, SPSS...
What do you all think I should get?
I currently have a 13"" MBP 2017, and my battery seems like its dying.. so I'm thinking it may be a good time to get a new model."
mbp 2020,Just replace your battery will do
mbp 2020,Agree if the MacBook is serving you well except the battery issue.
mbp 2020,"I initiated a return today for MBA 2020 😄. It gets hot while I was using it last night
What's the difference between the mbp 13"" 2019 and 2020 besides the keyboard?
and is the 2019 mbp 13"" keyboard that lousy? I been using a mbp 2011 and it has an inverted t keyboard already. I haven't been monitoring the development over the years.
I would love to try the difference at apple store but can't."
mbp 2020,"Aiyo... Keep seeing pple returning the MBA due to heat issue...
To spec both MBA and MBP with i5-10, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD, price diff is S$500. As a newbie in MacBook with light usage, dunno if I should spend the extra money..."
mbp 2020,Light usage no. Just stick with MBA.
mbp 2020,"No difference except the keyboard if comparing between the base model. The fourth gen butterfly keys are actually much improved and has a better typing experience. I actually like it a lot more than the scissor switch.
Besides, the butterfly keyboard has 4 years of warranty. Any issue, Apple will replace the whole base for you."
mbp 2020,"say if i maxed out the specs for a 13"" or 16""
can this replace my windows desktop ?
cos i wanna try jump back to osx, use windows abit sian liao
i'm considering between PC and Mac now. Had in mind to build a ryzen rig which cost about 4.8k to 5k
was using mac mini in 2012 then mbp 15"" in 2013-2015.
i dun play games.
just need to do video rendering, heavy photoshops and illustrator.
which one will be better ? 13"" or 16"" ?
any difference in performance between these 2 after maxed out ?
Also can consider iMac if they refresh it this year

TIA"
mbp 2020,You are better off waiting for the new iMac refresh this year. Its definitely coming.
mbp 2020,"ya lor , wait until neck long liao
my last iMac was a thick bezel/frame one lol,
like got a layer of powder or dust inside the screen. end up selling it.
forgot when i bought it.
any idea when will it be releasing ?"
mbp 2020,Still waiting for the first review to appear.
mbp 2020,"Not gonna hold out for the 14 inch one, already ordered my dbrand skin first, wait for it to arrive then order on Apple store."
mbp 2020,"Getting the slickwrap for my 13"""
mbp 2020,"MacBook Pro 13-inch: come for the keyboard, stay for the performance"
mbp 2020,"videos of the 2020 13"" MPB is out, but they are inclined towards the first impression and set up category of content. performance videos may have to wait for perhaps 1 week or over a substantive period
I still recall that 2020 MPA performance videos were released after a week or so and thermal issues were reported"
mbp 2020,This is the most detailed so far.
mbp 2020,"I am using the MBP 16 and I try to avoid chrome too...
even if you can take the noise, the battery drain will be there. No reason to use Chrome."
mbp 2020,"Always avoid Chrome when using macOS. Up till now google has yet to optimise Chrome for macOS.
You are better off with alternative like FireFox or Edge Chromium. Best experience with Safari."
mbp 2020,"for those that need Chrome, just use a tab suspender addon. it will greatly improve e experience with Chrome when multiple tabs r opened."
mbp 2020,chrome on windows is also unoptimised.....great browser but its such a memory hog!
mbp 2020,Chrome is shiat in windows 10 too.
mbp 2020,Will Apple check that you are a student during delivery if I placed my order on the education store?
mbp 2020,Posted with iPhone 11 Pro Max HardwareZone Forums app
mbp 2020,"Only will check when u placing your order or after placed order ?
Will not check when delivering"
mbp 2020,"Gone leave this thread now guys.
After much contemplation, I just placed an order for the morning refurb baseline 16 model.
From what Ive read on reddit and macrumour forums, the user experience on the 13 2020 will be solid.
See ya guys in the 14 thread!when it comes"
mbp 2020,Base model 8th Gen CPU vs high end 10th Gen CPU.
mbp 2020,Sounds like a good choice. $240 cheaper than the brand new education price.
mbp 2020,Why did you decide on the 16?
mbp 2020,"give it a go for a few mths and see. features wise its richer than the 13"" with the only pain point being the additional weight.
we shall see how it goes over the next few mths, i took a calculated risk to ""lose"" some $$ if the 14"" comes out and i decide i want that"
mbp 2020,"looking at the prices on Carousell, buy refurb and sell as 2nd hand don't lose much if any at all."
mbp 2020,"I was contemplating a 16 inch too. Coming from a 2015 15 inch, the footprint is identical and the 16 inch is slightly lighter. However my needs now meant the 16 inch would be insanely overkill and Ive been wanting to switch to a 13 inch due to the size and weight difference.
Interesting video for those coming from a 2012-2015 retina 15 inch.

mbp 2020,"exactly
my curiosity was piqued also"
mbp 2020,"If you can get the 16 then just do so. No point going to the 13. The performance gain is huge and the weight to me is negligible.
And since you are waiting for the 14, why not just wait for the new redesign 16"
mbp 2020,I see. The refurbished model gone very fast. You are lucky to grab one.
mbp 2020,Which config did you acquire?
mbp 2020,"There is another base model 16"" in space grey available if you're keen."
mbp 2020,lighter? i tot it is about the same weight? 2kg?
mbp 2020,"Anyone used the trade-in service before?
How would it work now? Will we have to drop off our mac somewhere?"
mbp 2020,Someone will pick it up from you.
mbp 2020,I see. Thanks!
mbp 2020,"Just be patient, every month got at least once available for a week or two in stock. Of course if you need it immediate then yes seems to not be in stock"
mbp 2020,"Haha I would wait but I need a laptop now.
I got the base model 16
I7 6 core/16gb ram /512 SSD
I use iCloud and I manage my space wel.
Using it for productivity apps, sketch up/autocad
Edit: Im also used to carrying large laptops around. Im in IT by trade for offices and large homes.
Figured the 16 made most sense for now and more sellable if I get the rumoured unicorn of a 14 mini-led laptop when its available."
mbp 2020,"For Autocad, 16 model is more suitable. A 13 model will still face bottleneck.
16 is a good buy. Been using the i9 version and the performance is top class."
mbp 2020,"Anyone decided and ordered the new MBP 13"" yet?"
mbp 2020,Did you hook up to an external monitor? Read there are some issues with that.
mbp 2020,"If I really like it, may return it get the i9/16gb/1tb/5500m gfx model....but the upgrades I dont need la..."
mbp 2020,"Havent received it but Ive read those issues can be worked around.
Lets not derail the thread with talks of the 16
Back to the 13, Reddit users who have received theirs are extremely pleased with the power and keyboard"
mbp 2020,The 2.0Ghz 13 this year is really very solid. Almost comparable with the base model 16.
mbp 2020,"Yeah numbers wise, but sheer power core count the 16 base still holds it own by a wide margin"
mbp 2020,"Still stuck between choosing the base new 13 2020 model or a refurb 16 base model
Not sure whether to go for 1TB upgrade option but refurb doesnt have that yet"
mbp 2020,Thats for sure as 16 has 2 additional cores. But the margin has closed up considerably when one encodes and exports 4K video from Final Cut Pro.
mbp 2020,"yes but the 16inch is slightly higher. by 400grams hahahah. 2.04kg vs 2.0kg. So they are almost identical. Dimensions and weight.
Also, if you are planning on getting a 13inch pro, the $2,999 model is so close to the base 16inch and actually more expensive than a refurb model. Its really hard to pick. Of course if youre just after portability, the 13inch is already your default choice. But if youre after power, the 16inch pro refurb is a much much better value. Now when I think back, the 15inch pro that I had before, I was fine with it in terms of size and weight, just that the 16inch is so overkill for me and my current workflow. but if the difference Is just $400 - 500 for a bigger screen, better performance, discrete graphics, better speakers and microphone and battery life, It might actually be worth it for some folks here. So for people who are still on a 2015 15inch or lower, the 16inch pro is the perfect upgrade."
mbp 2020,"When you guys are purchasing from the online store, remember to use ShopBack for the 1% cashback.
I just checked out the 13 MBP without using Shopback."
mbp 2020,Cancel and re-order.
mbp 2020,"Do you need the portability? 16"" has better value but portability is very important too for some."
mbp 2020,They were too fast for me to cancel and reorder. Hahaaa. I got to wait for them to deliver the unit to me and return it in order to do that.
mbp 2020,Was contemplating on these two too. But I found out that the butterfly keyboard from the previous models is really very horrible. You can do a quick search on YouTube and there are plenty of feedback on the butterfly keyboard.
mbp 2020,any reviews on base model mbp?
mbp 2020,huh? e 16 was e first of e recent MacBooks to have e new magic keyboard
mbp 2020,"The lastest Gen of butterfly keyboards were much better. Besides, Apple has 4 years of warranty cover on them which is super worth it."
mbp 2020,Go watch reviews on YouTube.
mbp 2020,A typical Mac can last for more than 4 years. I wont want to keep going to their service centre just to get the keyboard fixed just because of some dust.
mbp 2020,"Like I said, the latest gen butterfly keyboard is good. I had the first gen butterfly keyboard and it did experience some issues but at least Apple replaced a whole new MacBook with second gen keyboard for me.
Still using the latest butterfly gen from 2018 and the quality has been superb so far. With additional 4 years of warranty, I look forward to going into the service centre to have my MacBook replaced when its time"
mbp 2020,"use a external ssd would be cheaper
am undecided though whether to up the ram to 16gb for 13 base model just for web surfing, watching netflix and ms office"
mbp 2020,how did u get 4 years of additional warranty ?
mbp 2020,"I guess the additional 4 years of support is for the keyboard only. It is a service note/advisory to cover the life of this keyboard. I'd rather to have a reliable keyboard than one that breaks down every now and then and have to get it serviced/replaced, which can be a hassle."
mbp 2020,"For your mentioned usage, 8GB is more than enough."
mbp 2020,Agree.. It also depends on stock availability when you need to replace the keyboard. So you may end up without the Macbook for a few days or weeks.
mbp 2020,"oic.
i tot can extend device warranty"
mbp 2020,"Try checking the ""Max Tech"" channel on Youtube. I think their videos are quite good.
They have one comparing the base model and the upper tier one."
mbp 2020,"That depends. Usually theyll just replace the whole bottom cover if keyboard runs out of stock or better still, replace the whole MacBook.
If you are lucky, they might even replace the newer version for you. I dont want to say much more lol.."
mbp 2020,"Can ask, if case like my this tb 2016 mpb, got hope? no more warranty le."
mbp 2020,What happened to your MacBook Pro?
mbp 2020,No idea. The coating seems no more. Now the oil stain can't clean off no matter how hard I tried using with the microfiber cloth.
mbp 2020,You could found about this issue in here.
mbp 2020,This issue Apple will replace the LCD free of charge. Just go to the support app and select display issues to follow the instruction.
mbp 2020,"Is it fine to use a underpowered USB charger?
I intend to get a small ultra portable 30W GaN charger when travelling. The same charger will be used for iphone and Mac Pro.
1. I do not  expect to charge back to 100% when using as long as it sustain and do not drain fast during the day. At most I fully run on battery during day time.
2. I will charge it overnight at the end of the day bringing it back to 100% macbook off or in suspend
Will it damage the macbook or will it not charge even when powered off?
I understand USB chargers are not dumb chargers in the past, the voltage and ampere is negotiated between the device/charger before the power flows.
Is this a good idea?"
mbp 2020,"For 13 MacBook Pro, you can use a 30W charger to charge when the MacBook is idle but it will take a few hours to fully charged it. However, the battery life will still deplete if you are charging the MacBook Pro while using since there isnt enough power given to all the components.
Note that slower charging will stress the battery too."
mbp 2020,"anti reflective coating issue aka staingate. have been affecting all macbooks with retina display since it was introduced in 2012. there's no solution that i'm aware of unless you
1 not clean the display
2 not to let it come into contact with any kind of object
3 not pack the laptop in a backpack full with other things as pressure will on the chassis will cause the display to come into contact with the keyboard and either dirty the display or scratch the coating
4 keep it away from heat like using it on clamshell mode
if your macbook is under apple care they'll replace it for free. if it's past the warranty period likely you'll have to pay $800 if i'm not wrong, maybe less or more now unless you have some very good reason to explain. even after replacing the issue will be back after 2 to 4 years unless you take the precautions I mentioned above.
i'm using a late 2013 macbook pro retina 13"" and have replaced my display 4 or 5 times when it was under warranty. today i still face the staingate issue. there's a facebook group about this isssue as well"
mbp 2020,Its fine if you dont intend to charge and use at the same time

my usage is similar to yours, i won't be doing any editing work, that's why i'm stuck between new base MacBook pro 2020 13"" or go for refurb base MacBook pro 16""
whether the $500 premium will be worth it since it technically can last longer and I might just connect to monitor/TV most of the time yet i like bigger tech gadgets
*
can imagine the 16"" display and speaker difference over the 13"" model
""
really dilemma."
mbp 2020,"Yes the 16 MBP is using the new scissor key switches as well.
Lol since youll be connecting to an external monitor most of the time, why would you need a bigger display or speakers?"
mbp 2020,I think back to school not always will have?
mbp 2020,"i use dual screen mostly now still.
speaker cause i don't have a dedicated speaker, still relying that on the tablet"
mbp 2020,MacBook Air 2020 or MacBook Pro 2020 for uni starters?
mbp 2020,"Depends on your usage. Do you need heavy processing? Any special software that you need to use?
List them down so people here can decide whats best for your usage."
mbp 2020,"Paiseh got no 16"" thread so gotta post here
Any better offers than this for 16"" MBP?"
mbp 2020,This config is $4749 at retail. So this is as good as it gets even for return model.
mbp 2020,return model means what ah
mbp 2020,can share where that listing is from?
mbp 2020,"apple edu store, idk if student or teacher is it the same price boh ?
mine is a teacher account"
mbp 2020,Refurbished model from Refurbished Store I mean. No difference to me between retail or refurb model except for the box.
mbp 2020,"oic.
aiyah brand new set got more placebo effect for me lol
u tell me is apple refurbed at 4k i also won't buy."
mbp 2020,"Can someone confirm whether this  new 2020 13"" MBP in SG uses the UK ISO layout for the keyboard rather than the US layout? If Apple SG only sells the UK layout, then that is a deal breaker for me because I'm not at all used to UK layout.
The website shows UK layout but I remember previous MBPs had the US layout.
UK Layout
US Layout"
mbp 2020,u can choose from 6 keyboard layouts
mbp 2020,I thought that's just the MacOS keyboard language and not the physical layout? Please correct me if I am wrong
mbp 2020,"Youll be a fool for not considering a refurb model from Apple.
Refurb units from Apple gone through much stringent test compared to retail units."
mbp 2020,Agree totally!  You just need to be patient to get refurb set..
mbp 2020,"i dun buy refurbed sets cos i usually change a new laptop or gadget within 3-6 mths. i dun use a machine as long as u guys
refurbed sets will not fetch as much as brand new sets. that is my experience tho
i buy liao, i use a while i will get bored then change liao.
shortest period i used a macbook air was 5 days lol and that was the stupid butterfly keyboard"
mbp 2020,"Anyone can confirm the keyboard for refurb sets?
Dont seem to have any description for it and the touch are MBP pro all show UK kb on the image"
mbp 2020,Refurb set and brand new set when you resell them is all second-hand
mbp 2020,"From what I understand, the 10th gen Intel CPU in the 13 inch MBP is the i5-1038NG7. It seems that the 28W TDP isnt fully utilised because the 13 inch MBPs thermals arent that good. Meaning to say the boosted clock speeds would likely not be realised. A quick google search showed an article about this based on early benchmarks. Is it then worth the premium over the 8th gen CPU in the base model?
Context: Im currently on the 2015 15 inch MBP with the i7-4870HQ CPU no discrete graphics chip and am thinking of upgrading to a 13 inch MBP."

Can I check if let say I crafted a word document in windows pc/laptop, when I open it in word in Apple macbook/iPad Pro, will it open up in exactly the same format and able to read all the symbols used?
Cheers!"
mbp 2020,"For most of the texts and symbols, yes. Unless you are using custom fonts or symbols.
If youre using custom fonts, you have to install on the devices youre going to open the word document with.

mbp 2020,"I have the i5 MBP and i7 MBA 2020. Wanted to test out which was better before returning/selling either one.
The 10th gen difference vs 8th gen is only faster graphics processing and slightly higher multi core performance. Which to me is negligible because day to day use you most likely only utilise single core.
Unless u are hard up about the lack or ports then get the 10th gen. If not the 8th gen with 2 ports is more than enough."
mbp 2020,"Anyone looking for a 16"" MBP, can try amazon. It is having a $300 discount right now."
mbp 2020,adding shipping and stuff does it make sense? and of course the power socket is diff plug also
mbp 2020,"I will most likely go with a 10th gen processor due to the better integrated graphics. Comparing the i7-1060N7 on the MBA and i5-1038NG7 on the MBP, the benchmarks seem to suggest what you have described I.e. similar single core performance, better multi core performance. But at 512GB SSD / 16GB RAM configuration, the MBP cost $300 more and has 2 additional USB C ports.
My consideration would be: does the MBP have longer battery life and better screen? Weight wise seems similar 1.27kg vs 1.4kg. I dont do any video editing, but I do run boot camp for windows 10 occasionally and game on it lowest settings and 720p of course."
mbp 2020,"why ah ?
why are they giving discounts ?
is it a new refresh is coming or they wanna clear this batch for new model ?"
mbp 2020,"I looking at 13 mpb. Is 256 ssd upgradable in the future? The additional $300 to increase to 512gb is a bit too much.
I Mainly use it for coding and my wife would bootcamp to windows"
mbp 2020,"no, it's soldered on."
mbp 2020,"save the hassle and get refurb,
there are some refurb models including CTO refurbs in the online store now
Refurb models are as  good as new. no scuffs, no marks, no damage. checked thoroughly, come with 1 year warranty and is eligible for applecare+
edut: added info"
mbp 2020,"I second what Chevalier and adiboy says. I just received my refurbished 16"" and I seriously cannot tell apart between a brand new set and this. Tried to find some scuffs or visible faults by peering into the ports even but everything looks and smells brand new. I saved a bit of money and guys.. The speakers for the 16"" is insanely good! I don't think there's any laptop that can beat the sound!
I would really suggest to re-consider if you can pay a little more. Refurbished sets seems to come with brand new cables and charger and battery. Didn't know that they will change the outershell too."
mbp 2020,"I think we should have 16"" MBP thread!  Haha."
mbp 2020,"Then it to question do you bring it around Everyday. To me the 100g is negligible. But I can guarantee the MBA lasts longer day to day.
Performance wise MBP will outclass MBA by 60% due to better thermals and MBA at the fly is hot when running cpu intensive stuff like."
mbp 2020,Apple increase upgrade upgrade prices ☹️
mbp 2020,we already have one
mbp 2020,"I was looking at the base macbook pro with 16gb ram, was gonna buy but too late. Now have to fork out additional 150$ for the same thing.... zzzzzzzzzzz"
mbp 2020,Chrome or Safari? 5mins/1% seems quite reasonable
mbp 2020,"So most prob i will go for MBP base model, thinking if i should just pony up $500 and get the 10th gen and be happy for years. Or just stick to the MBP base model as a stop gap solution till next year when the new 14inch mini led mbp launches."

mbp 2020,stick to windows laptops if u want to run windows.
mbp 2020,there are certain application which i need to run in windows. thanks for your feedback.
mbp 2020,"if there r only certain applications u can try VMs in macOS using virtualbox, parallels etc"
mbp 2020,finally made the decision to purchase the mbp 13
mbp 2020,What is the spec ?
mbp 2020,"Hi Apple expert,
Can i check if student price is the cheapest way to get a macbook now?
I would like a MBA 2020 but I have heard of thermal issue. Or would MBP be better even though it is $450 more?
Would you guys recommend getting applecare?
I may not be using this laptop alot very I already have a desktop at home and the reason I want to buy a laptop is because I am enrolling in some basic upskilling computing modules. Please advise."
mbp 2020,"Cheapest is to wait for it to be released in refurb store bah
Base 2019 16 inch MBP
Retail : $3499
Student : $3209
Refurb : $2969
So refurb mac with student applecare probably lowest cost."
mbp 2020,"wait for 1 month more or so, during Back To School promo, they will give you a headset, last year is beats, this year US's is airpods.
get to buy the mac with student price
sell off the headset and you get to buy a better price"
mbp 2020,my apologies. been some time since i last used a mbp. was wondering does anyone install anti virus on the mbp? if so can recommend?
mbp 2020,"yup, this year back to school offer is quite good, free airpods and can pay extra to upgrade airpods pro."
mbp 2020,"thanks. but i installed avg. lol

mbp 2020,"MBP13 with i7, 32gb ram and 1tb cost 3700? Fark expensive"
mbp 2020,Need so high specs?
mbp 2020,i7 upgrade looks really pointless IMO and at that cost can get 16 inch alr
mbp 2020,"my guess will be mid of july and last until early sept or mid of sept.
worth to wait till then for sure if you have plan for macbook purchase or even ipad air or ipad pro purchase."
mbp 2020,Will a refurb version qualify for the free gift?

MBP Battery Swelling,"My MBP 15 inch 2018 battery swelling.. anyone have same problem ?
Less than 2 years only .. and they want me pay for battery replacement .. seems more like it their issue .. i never had any device be it phone or laptop battery swelling .."
MBP Battery Swelling,check their website if there is any recall order for it
MBP Battery Swelling,"Never buy applecare?
is your mbp on constant charge?"
MBP Battery Swelling,"check already .. previous models have .. but not the 2018 one .. i think because quite recent and problems start coming up already when its close to 2 years..
no buy .. tot should be able to last .. was thinking to change mbp next yearbecause 16 inch + better keyboard + possibly new cpu liao ..
i check the website its $288
yea .. now only the latest catalina they have this battery management problem ..
i check the apple discussion seems like alot of people have the same problem
i can accept if the battery cannot last as long .. but the swelling like hazard sia .."
MBP Battery Swelling,Please replace the battery.
MBP Battery Swelling,I think Apple care is always a good deal. Its technology after all. Bound to fail
MBP Battery Swelling,"If theres no recall notice means its not really a major issue. Yours might just be some isolated cases where faults might from manufacturing problems.
Im still using my mid 2015 one, and Ive absolutely no problems whatsoever since day 1. Battery cycle count is 450 and capacity hovers around the 84-87% range, so which means life a little shorter than normal.
I still love it very much due to the different ports it has plus the illuminated Apple logo, which is the last model to have it. The MBP still runs pretty speedy on Catalina, awaiting Big Sur.
Those being said, yours technically is out of warranty so a swollen battery replacement means paying in full, and please stop using immediately for safety reasons. Its either you replace the batt or buy a new MBP, which the former is a wiser choice and 2018 model is still considered rather new."
MBP Battery Swelling,"I think you should just replace the battery for $288 and then wait for another 1-2 years to buy a new MacBook with ARM.
As advised by others, meanwhile please stop using the MacBook."
MBP Battery Swelling,go to somewhere like macplus if dun want to pay  price on e replacement batt
MBP Battery Swelling,"not sure .. but there are quite alot of people complaining in the apple forums from my search .. same 2018 model ..
my battery cycle not even 100.. yea probably have to go replace the battery but just saying nv had this problem before .. especially for a premium product and they had this problem before
, makes me think if the problem is still happening .."
MBP Battery Swelling,"apple store is open to walk in ? support say cannot walk in .. but online they dont have appointment slot ..
zzz"
MBP Battery Swelling,"I have 3 MacBooks, MacBook Pro 2013, MacBook Pro 2018, New MacBook, all had swollen battery problem 1-2 years after purchase, luckily I had 3y AppleCare for all of them so simply sent in and got it replaced, not only battery but they also need to replace cover, keyboard, touchpad.
Strange is, after replaced battery, I no longer had this problem any more, the MacBook Pro 2013 had battery replaced somewhere in 2015, so far it still looks good."
MBP Battery Swelling,"My late 2013 MacBook Pro retina 13 inch the original battery also started to swell but I only noticed it on the 6th year in 2019 cause I put it on laptop stand so only when I placed it on flat surface then realise it wobbles. It probably started swelling a little in 2018 so roughly around 5 years I think most batteries will swell.
Paid $288 to change as I didn't see a need to buy the newer MacBook especially with the butterfly keyboard issue. Apple will replace the entire bottom half of your MacBook and reuse the motherboard and the bottom plate with serial number engraved unless it got bent excessively then apple will replace with a generic bottom plate with no serial number. So basically you will at least get new top half casing of the bottom, new keyboard, new track pad, and of course new battery.
I leave it plugged into power fully charged like almost 95% of the time which the apple staff told me it's not good for the battery and may be the reason for swelling. I'm still on OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 so I believe you don't need the battery health management feature in macOS 10.15.5 as it took 5 to 6 years before the battery started swelling. If I remember correctly the cycle count was about 600/1000."
MBP Battery Swelling,"My 2015 model quite recently also have an official from Apple on overheating batts and catching fire, but seems to affect those bought from Sep 2015. Fortunately mine was bought a few days after launch in May 2015, so no issues.
Premium products are not immune to defects. One classic example is that a lot of MBPs are affected by the staingate issue where the coating on the screen wears out unevenly, showing ugly stains on it."
MBP Battery Swelling,"Quickly change
Will make the whole laptop burst
Metal all bent"
MBP Battery Swelling,"You can but on condition they have staff to serve you whenever theres a free slot, else prepare to wait for at least an hr or two.
Appointment slots are very limited now due to current restrictions so check back regularly for a slot, but need to wait at least several days now."

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Considering that it's also launching in India and most international press is covering it as well, I doubt it."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Looks good. The only problem is no webcam. How to do webinar and elearning?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Get a separate webcam.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,cannot just reformat meh?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,The point is that people want portability. Anything to reduce hassle is a plus.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Lol, the drive is a sata drive leh, i hope its m2 sata. Otherwise, no point liao.. the 2.5"" gonna sacrifice other stuff."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,It uses M.2 Sata. But supports M.2 NVMe. You can still swap out for NVMe drive if you require fast storage speed
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"If I recalled, It has to be a fresh install of windows + valid cd key.

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Understand that but at this budget can find perfect notebook? Even with webcam some people will say pq is bad etc.
Even notebooks are higher price points aren't perfect.
Dgpu is considered a deal breaker for some but not for everyone.
Every buyer based on his use case decide whether the notebook can sure most of his requirements."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"That's good, but how u know? I really doubt so, u see the battery capacity only 40+ Wh?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,when expected to be available? Xiaomi every day like to play OOStock for new pdt launch.

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,sian no camera........
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Xiaomi has confirmed to us that the company has no plans to launch the new RedmiBook series outside of Mainland China
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,buy from taobao and ship back via 3rd party lor. simple.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"go info, fast turn of event tho."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Using my personal forwarder, wanted to get the G14 previously, but cancelled cause my seller couldnt get hold of stock early. So gotten this instead, since my main sole criteria is having 100% sRGB
Well, most probably i would be re-installing my own Windows 10. But however even by having Chinese OS, i doubt there will be any issue as you can download language pack."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Chinese OS is one concern as is a skin down version for China market. ie not upgradeable unless fresh install.

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,How much shipping cost? You went through what platform? Taobao?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Shipping not confirmed yet, but should be around the ball park of 30-40SGD.
Yes Taobao Tmall"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,No need gst?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Bro how you think of your Redmibook? Is it good in gaming and video editing? Since it is integrated GPU. I was thinking whether to get Remibook or Mi notebook pro for content creation.

Well i'm getting it for Adobe premier pro and lightroom. I'm sure it would be able to run well, just dont expect H series performance. For the price:performance ratio. Its pretty sweet
Will let you know how it runs when i receive it next monday"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Best not to buy. Tech guy gave a review of the 16 inch model and there were several issues. Rough edges all around, no keyboard backlight, no webcam and there is a recurring problem with the SSD/Motherboard. Thought of getting it initially, but decided to go with Lenovo's Xiaoxin 13 Pro instead.

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,With Renoir ? Why not you recommend me one ?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"For even lower price, surely forgivable for lack of Renoir
Or you can tolerate ssd/motherboard issue just for Renoir ?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Well we shall see whether it's an isolated problem or a batch issue for SSD/motherboard when I received it.
If it's isolated, I'm lucky. If it's not, just swap SSD and see how things goes.

Yup bought from TMALL with my own forwarder.
Will test it out later on to see whether it supports wireless projection."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Can share the tmall link? Looking forward to your initial impressions.
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Hi,
Just wondering if it is true about this notebook.
1. No backlit keyboard.
2. SATA SSD instead of NVME SSD.
3. No Camera.
4. No separated numeric keypad in the 16 inch form factor.
5. memory frequency is only 2666MHZ. not 1:1 infinity fabric ratio
6. 40 watt hour battery."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Bro, what's the specs for you remibook 16?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"I would say this notebook isn't suitable for everyone due to the warranty + price ratio.
Due to it being under the budget series, lots of component choices was pretty subpar SATA Drive instead of NVMe, DDR4 2666Mhz, No Backlit KB.
However the Screen Color & Near Bezel-less form is love
Build quality is way better than my previous Lenovo Slim Ideapad 5 Renoir based, as it is aluminium all round and sturdy.
I gotten the R5 4500U | 16GB | 512GB Model
1. No Backlit
2. Correct default is Sata SSD, However it supports NVMe. Swapped mine with NVMe Drive.
3. Not a deal breaker, could attach my BRIO is needed.
4. Positive thing for me, as i dont use Numpad even for my desktop
5. Correct, its running dual channel at 2666Mhz instead of 3200Mhz for current renoir base notebook
6. 46Whr to be exact
Currently its 3799RMB, a raise of 100RMB as it was a preorder price previously."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Hi bro, did you encounter any hardisk issues?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"I did not run into any issue with the default Sata Drive as per what was shown on 1 youtube video.
Did afew bootup with it with no issue so far during that duration, but had since replaced with my own NVMe drive"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Cool, sounds like this laptop is quite a good catch. Maybe after you try out with certain games and let us know is it worth the money. I wanted to buy this for video editing, hope it’s good enough. Oh btw, u replaced with your own Nvme SSDs means you need to reinstall your own OS? And those free MS office would be gone too?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Sure i'll update the performance once i get my reinstalled windows 10 up and running
One thing to take note would be, if any of you guys are considering to reinstall windows 10. Please take note that Wifi will not be installed with the default driver that is included in windows 10 iso."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Meaning? Have to download the driver? If cannot access wifi how to download?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"I used my smartphone to hotspot internet via USB. After your computer have the network detected, it'll automatically detect and download the relevant drivers.
Not too sure why the default Windows 10 ISO downloaded from Microsoft did not detect hardware and install the generic driver automatically"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Could it be a hardware issue? Before you reinstall, was the wifi working?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Oh its not hardware issue, because my wifi is currently working after i installed the driver through network updates. Maybe the generic driver was not present in the ISO."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Is it heavy? Is the screen clear enough?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Hi Bro, what's your feedback on the Redmi Book so far?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Looking forward to the review
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"how is the screen content creater ?
Sent from Tehhan's iPhone using GAGT"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"The color is really sweet for its price. The 300 Nits of brightness is sufficient for me to view it under sunlight due to it being matte coating as well.
At least i'm comparing it with the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5 that i owned previously which doesn't seem to produce the hue of red accurately.
So far the battery life has been pretty surprisngly considering the fact it is only packing 46WHr. I could netflix for around 5-6 Hours i still leave me with around 30%+. Already a happy man because the previous Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5, with R7 4700U, the battery draining was pretty bad. Only lasting around 6 Hours before the battery got fully depleted.
Advertised 100% sRGB and 90% Screen Ratio is the key factor for anyone getting this Laptop. Because in actual fact, no KB Backlit lighting and Sata SSD would definitely turn off majority of the users.
Build & Material quality wise is very good considering for the price that i purchased with. No complain on it.
Tried running Cinebench, with the setting set at Balance & Turbo R5 4500U was pulling a constant 30W maintaining 3.8 Balance and around 35W 3.9-4 Turbo. Laptop itself wasn't particularly warm as well, its cooled pretty thoroughly. In actual use case scenario, at least for photoshop and lightroom editing has been pretty smooth for me No sluggish performance seen so far. Yet to render any Videos yet, but will update once i have the chance.
So far it has been a pretty good buy for me. But for those who are thinking to buy, please remember by default it comes with SATA SSD. I self replaced it with NVMe and reinstalled a Windows 10 Home Automatically activated.
ps, from far it really does look like a 16"" Macbook Pro lol"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,how come they didn't put the cam LOL..

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Hi bro, you said Windows 10 automatically activated when reinstalled, what that means?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"I reinstalled it with the default windows 10 that was downloaded off microsoft website. I was expecting to activate with my own Windows key, however it just automatically got activated. I think the previous Windows key Chinese OS was embedded in the motherboard or something"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Wah thats awesome, I thought it will wipe out the entire thing since you reinstall new ssd. Btw what was the forwarder you used? I am going to place order too."

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"750 is unit price
need to factor in gst and shipping fee which is around $850 ?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Please recommend a competitive product at a comparable price here in SG?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,keep posting prices without gst and shipping to mislead people?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"With the added GST and freight charges, I still cannot find anything that can match the above in SG.
Please recommend a competitive product at a comparable price ok?"

What is ""hwz is not sls ah beng shop""?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,At most $820??
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"About there, but faster just by abit. I guess is that premier pro is more optimized for NVIDIA cuda core as compared to openGL rendering."

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Can you share the legion 5 configuration of last weekend sale which is $900+ including gst and shipping after 37% discount?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,bro can share your forwarder also?
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"china forwarder can use ezbuy
but better buy insurance"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"There is no need for 3rd party forwarder when buying from official flagship stores on platforms for example JD.
They will ship direct to your designated address.
Similar to ""shipped/sold by newegg"" or ""shipped/sold by amazon"""
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Okay thanks for info bro. Mind sharing how to order off JD? Like need China credit card? Or any credit card also can. Is it a very straightforward process is what I am trying to find out. Thinking of maybe buying the Mechrevo S2 Air 4600H off JD. Thanks bro!
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Pretty straight forward registration similar to NewEgg or Amazon.
I used a SG CC for purchase.
JD should take care of the shipping when you buy from the vendor's ""Self operated official flagship store""
It will be helpful if you can read and understand
chinese
, although you can use google translate, but certain meanings might be lost to translation.
As a registered user, there are many other functions you can explore. you get coupons , promo discounts, tracking alerts, earn points, new signup perks, earn JD beans by writing reviews, chat with CSO etc..
which i didn't bother because reading them gives me headache.
And.... disable stuffs like Ad blocker , cookies auto delete browser extensions while making payment, I had experienced the website kicked me back to the login page if i don't.
Note:
There are times where by the flagship stores themselves do not want to entertain overseas purchases for certain batches of goods.
Same when as you go into newegg US or amazon US when the item added in the cart ""disappear"" after changing location to SG.
Also,
Anyway,
Why Mechrevo S2 Air 4600H?
is it because it is thin and light? 14"" 1.13kg
is it because it has the ability to run the processor in 65watt?
is it because it has better cooling among ultraportables? 2heatpipes+2Fans
Why not the Mechrevo S2 Air 4800H?
is it because the price difference is $160 SGD?
Or simply because it is currently out of stock?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Thanks for taking the effort to reply bro! Gonna be using it just for uni, got desktop at home already, so I dont think worth the money to upgrade to the 4800H, whats your opinion on this bro? Btw do you think the Mechrevo S2 Air is a good deal? Originally planning on buying the USD599 Lenovo Flex 5 4500U off Amazon, but always no stock so looking for alternatives now. Would like something like a 2-in-1/Touchscreen so can take notes but I think dont have also nvm"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Specs and Prices wise it looks to be a good deal.
The Mechrevo S2 Air looks to be the most powerful thin and light notebook with the 4600H/4800H.
Though mechrevo might be a smaller ""reseller"" compared to the other big manufacturers, if you are comfortable with that.
Note that buying from overseas be it Lenovo or other brands your warranty will be base on the that region unless stated otherwise."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"From what I read the ODM is Tongfang, and the S2 Air is the new version of the laptop that Walmart used to sell as Motile and I think the general view is that its pretty good. So yea I guess I'll be pretty comfortable with it.
Just not too sure about the cooling capability of this laptop and also the battery life... Couldnt find much about it online between it being a China release and being a new release"

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"You can take a look at the review of the 4800H version chinese
Cooling wise, 2 heatpipes + 2 fans seems to be the maximum for ultraportables."
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,Really thanks for the effort bro really appreciate it. Guess for battery life must wait for more reviews! Thanks!!
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"You are welcomed.
Battery life can be derived / calculated if you watch the video closely.
Renoir notebooks typically have 4 power configurations.
Idle10W Eco15W, Balanced25W and high performance35W to 54W."

Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"Interesting, care to share which particular HP/Lenovo model ?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,hmm...maybe worth it to get the Code 01 instead for the larger battery?

For your JD deliveries, has it been UPS handling all the deliveries so far?"
Xiaomi Redmi Ryzen 4000,"The delivery person will pass you an ""import certificate"" upon paying the GST.
It Depends on the value of the goods and their SLA.

When to ""Best"" and the sale person recommand this over ASUS, Dell, etc.
Hope to get some feedback from actual user. Thanks"
LG brand 14,lg gram damn satki
LG brand 14,"Got new model coming out soon. Wait for it to be released. 14z90n -- has ice lake processor and Wifi6 and thunderbolt3.
Unfortunately only 8gb ram and 512gb storage though."
LG brand 14,??? meaning
LG brand 14,Went to best denki today. Now the new gram got promo... Free upgrade to 16gb ram and pay 118 to upgrade to 2x512gb ssd
LG brand 14,"new 10th gen model is out, can do pre order at best vivo city,
new gram price over old gram is $300 difference. see which one u prefer ba.
gram has 2 strong points, weight and battery life, no one able to win them on this 2 things combine, and military grade tested also. means drop wont spoil lol"
LG brand 14,Only thing is compared to other ice lake laptops this one use only ddr4 2666 ram Vs lpddr4x 3733
LG brand 14,"i think latest 2020 grams are ddr4 3200
but yes, could have used lpddr4 rams instead"
LG brand 14,"I saw the brochure write ddr4 2666 only though. Officially, ice lake supports up to ddr4 3200.  Not sure how this will affect igpu performance."
LG brand 14,should be 3200mhz. saw the brochure on their website
LG brand 14,"Oh nice! That's good to hear then...
Thinking of whether to get this and then sell away the Dell XPS 13 9300 which I ordered last week and supposed to come next week..."
LG brand 14,If u planning to get this let me know. Got lobang
LG brand 14,I'm curious. Can Pm me?
LG brand 14,"Challenger at bugis has stock for this.
The screen doesn't look very nice though. Glossy, but isn't very bright. on their demo set I also noticed that the colours are a bit uneven -- white background is a bit reddish on one side and greenish on the other.
Build quality wise, you press down a bit then can see the whole laptop ""bend"" already. A bit flimsy.
Imo the Acer Swift 5 seems like a better laptop than this. Unfortunately the swift 5 is saddled by a QLC SSD and... Well it's Acer lol"
LG brand 14,"what is the price for the i5 and i7 for the new 90n model.
will be getting it soon if not much from the 990 model.
thanks."
LG brand 14,"bro, you have good price lobang. Pls PM me. I need to get it fast by latest April."
LG brand 14,"Valueclub Hachi now selling for 1899 i5 and 2199 for i7. Are you a challenger member?
Yesterday best denki Funan quote me 2250 for i7"
LG brand 14,"i5 990 model 14"" at harvey norman only $1699 with $200 plus free gift"
LG brand 14,can pm me too
LG brand 14,"got what free gift? Z90N also got the free ram upgrade, free sleeve etc from the service centre..."
LG brand 14,"you can chk it out on Lg/sg/ website and pick where to buy and select H.Norman store.
Their free gift as stated there are . 1TB portable Harddisk, 1 portable bluetooth speaker, I usb-c multiport adaptor and1wireless mouse . Total =s256.70
But i doubt the above cost that much. Need to chk the physical items.
Anyway I still prefer the 990 over the 90N.
even the later have better spec.. but ....... Not becos of $
if not will be the new Thinkpad model."
LG brand 14,"If not because of money then why ah? Just curious. The two models look identical, justt hat the z90 has ice lake with iris plus graphics, thunderbolt 3 and Wifi6. These three features enough to make me choose the newer model anyday...
I just clarified with digital hub the distro though, apparently the SSD upgrade to 1tb is not applicable for the newer model"
LG brand 14,"haha, Dun overlook on the better spec , there are many more on the laptop to make the final consideration."
LG brand 14,"How much does the 15Z90N and the 17Z90N cost?
BTW, by default, they come with 16GB RAM DDR4 3200MHz, right?
What NVMe SSD brand are they using?
The LG GRAM allows the use of external power bank to charge it. Anyone knows which power banks can be used?
The only gripes I have are
a No touch screen
b No 4K screen
c Only 1 USB-C port
d It's TB port is weak and useless as far as connecting to eGPU for gaming is concerned. This has been tested in the version before the 90N series and the video is on YouTube by D2D
Thanks"
LG brand 14,"Can check Harvey Norman, challenger website for price. Currently Challenger offering 100 off if you buy from Hachi.
By default is 8gb ram, but buy now till 30 april free upgrade to 16gb at Lg Service centre
SSD yesterday when I checked the demo set at challenger bugis it was a Samsung"
LG brand 14,"Checked websites. Not there yet
The demo set was 14, 15 or 17 inch?"
LG brand 14,Demo set was 14 inch. There's also a 17 inch demo set but I didn't check the SSD.
LG brand 14,"Thank you
But no mention of free 8GB RAM upgrade to 16GB RAM. Also, no mention of warranty"
LG brand 14,"Also need to take note of the CA3 and BA3 on the model. As CA3 is Home and BA3 is Pro. Both are 64bits . but again if you hold a genuine pro activation key you can use it to do a upgrade online.
Again most do not need the Pro series.
As for the ram. it only have a single slot. So need to remove the 8 to put in the 16. As for the SSD they have 2 slots."
LG brand 14,"I will be buying either of the 14"" model. 990 or 90N"
LG brand 14,"You mean CA3 comes with Win 10 Home and BA3 comes with Win 10 Pro?
If you check online some managed to upgrade the RAM to 24GB for earlier models. Is there a 24GB RAM stick?"
LG brand 14,"8+16gb add in
that additional slot is a ram or ssd one. so once you put another stick of ram in, you will not be able to slot another ssd in"
LG brand 14,In store the LG brochure shows upgrade to 16gb and upgrade to 2 year warranty for all z90n models... Standard provided by LG service centre The major chain stores should have the brochure ba.
LG brand 14,"I had the impression that the additional sodimm is separate from the second m2 slot? At least for the older models, you can upgrade ram and +1 SSD."
LG brand 14,"Actually, overseas 15 and 17 inch come with 16GB RAM pre-installed. Don't understand why LG here wants us to bring the laptop to their service centre to upgrade. Farking stupid for making us busy!!"
LG brand 14,"So the latest model 90N only comes with 1 RAM slot and 2x SSD slots? No way to upgrade the RAM to 24GB RAM then, right?
Many thanks"
LG brand 14,"it comes with 8gb soldered to the mobo, and one empty ram slot which the service centre will fill with 8gb ram. If I'm not wrong, there are also 2 M2 SSD slots, one of which is filled with 512gb.
You can get a 16gb ram to fill in the second slot instead for 24gb."
LG brand 14,"Is it confirmed what you said? Can the laptop recognized the 24GB RAM?
Do you know which brand/model of power bank that can charge the LG GRAM?"
LG brand 14,"I cannot confirm but based on those press releases search for LG gram 24gb looks like it's supported.
Try and see lor haha..."
LG brand 14,"all LG gram Z990 supports up to max of 24GB Ram, can run either 2400mhz or 2666mhz, on board is 2400mhz, yes 8gb is onboard
Z990 series supports PCIE ssd also....but only i know how to enable it/how it works LOL
For the reason why new model does not have the $118 to upgrade to 1TB...is becos Pcie SSD cost difference."
LG brand 14,haha. You are reaching .....
LG brand 14,"I just got the latest 10th Gen brochure from Challenger@Bugis a while ago
Yes, RAM can be upgradeable to 24GB with 8GB default and 16GB upgradeable. According to the brochure the RAM is of 3200MHz
It comes with 1 + 1 year pick-up warranty. Need to register online for the 2nd yr warranty. Also, covers 1 yr International warranty.
It also states that all RAM upgrade and payment of $118 would be made at LG Svc Ctr. I just checked with LG and they say the $118 is for upgrading the SSD from 512GB to 1TB
BTW the 17 inch uses 80Wh battery. So in terms of amp-hr is how much?
Anyone knows which brand/model of power bank with PD can be used eg Anker, RAVPower, Aukey etc to charge the LG Gram 17? The battery level indicated on the Gram 17 must not drop during charging and using it.
Must pay to upgrade to Win 10 Pro"
LG brand 14,"45w should work. 65w would definitely work better?
the previous generation draw <45w at peak usage according to this article:"
LG brand 14,"SSD $118 is not available for z90n... i have just check with LG HQ.....
most of the brand powerbank as long as Power delivery is above 60w can charge..... but theres is a small ***.... if u want to know pls PM to ask"
LG brand 14,"I checked with its Service Ctr and was told the $118 is for upgrading the SSD to 1TB
BTW, already pm you. Maybe you can tell me the problems you faced in charging the LG Gram 17 using powerbank with PD"
LG brand 14,"just ordered 17z90n at challenger. self collect later evening
if u have valueclub member its 2699
couple best denki outlets claim no stock. and they only give 2799"
LG brand 14,"my price 100% lower then challenger.... even after their""member"" discount....."
LG brand 14,"the previous gen use a 25w tdp i7 8565u?
this new 10 gen ice lake is pretty interesting, 15w tdp i7 1065g7
slightly better benchmarks according to cpubenchmark.com
60% of previous gen power envelop, theres likelihood a lower wattage powerbank can still power it."
LG brand 14,i7 8565u also 15w. not sure how to explain why the total draw is almost 35w so i attached the picture here lol. i guess the display suck some power also bah.
LG brand 14,interesting...
LG brand 14,can arrange to collect same day? thought the website says >2working days.
LG brand 14,"Thing is LG is using ddr4 Vs lpddr4x ram, so power consumption on idle will be significantly higher.
Also, clock speed of the ram, hopefully 3200mhz? If 2666mhz will probably impact igpu performance a fair bit.
Power bank can try the zmi 65w. Carousell going for about 80 bucks"
LG brand 14,"just to inform all, challenger has to revert back the price to $2799. u can even see it in their webpage which has already reflected the changes. LG gram offical launch date for z90n is 9/03/2020 btw."
LG brand 14,"i went down to retail outlet to inquire. was offered self collection in 4hrs.
playing with it now, v satisfied with purchase. screen size really wow. bigger than macbook pro 16 !! yet it feels lighter than macbook pro 13
i7 and decent specs means its generally speedy in most tasks
for users more used to windows this is a good buy."
LG brand 14,"Heng ha you bought the one with the latest 10th Gen Intel CPU otherwise you'll face problem. Read below

for this OMARS charger, how is the charging speed?

LG brand 14,"Haven't got my laptop yet. Can you also help to check the laptop adapter's dc output amp and voltage? Is it 9Vx3A or 15Vx3A?
Thanks"
LG brand 14,So it is PM981 model. Thanks
LG brand 14,How much did you pay for the pd charger? If very expensive should have gone for the MacBook 91w charger instead
LG brand 14,"The price is $39.90 ValueClub memeber is $29.90
I'm using it to charge the powerbank only for it has a 30W max input charge. It is definitely insufficient to charge the LG GRAM laptop
Edit - I thought the MacBook Pro PD charger is 96W?"
LG brand 14,"I was informed that the battery of 72Wh inside the old 17 inch is of 9360mAh
Therefore, for the latest 17 inch 80Wh battery inside the 10th Gen model it should be 10400mAh
Make sure if you buy any external power bank it has sufficient capacity to charge the said laptop otherwise you'll end up charging the power bank daily instead
🙄"

isnt it a little overkill
plus a bit on the heavy side
im looking for a charger that charge reasonably fast and still small/light enough for everyday"

will be heading down LG svc centre this week for free gifts and get this installed"
LG brand 14,"Yeah 96W my bad. Okay, $29.90 is quite a good price.
For power bank, can try the ZMI 65W power bank... not as expensive as the Cygnett."
LG brand 14,"Based on the ZMI 65W PD 20000mAh 72Wh power bank specs below it won't be able to give a full charge to the 80Wh LG GRAM 17 inch 10th Gen. It is, however, cheaper and lighter
Its input is limited to 45W which is better in terms of charging speed over the CYGNETT's 30W input which needs longer time to charge the larger 27000mAh battery.
A power bank of 26800/27000mAh is about 99.9/100Wh, hence, can give slightly more than a full charge to the 80Wh LG GRAM 17 10th Gen"
LG brand 14,"For those who need a fast charge to the power bank it is best to look for power bank with 100W PD input like the Mobisun below. With a 100W PD Charger you can charge it full within 1.5 hrs
Or the
Zendure SuperTank 100W PD 27000mAh power bank

The weight of these 2 power banks is 500g or less. Other 27000mAh power banks goes into the 600+g weight
Note that USB-C cables for 100W 20V 5A charging input/output needs to be E-Mark.

LG brand 14,"Morning all !! how many of you have purchased an LG Gram ?
shall we start an owners club ?"
LG brand 14,Haven't got mine yet lah
LG brand 14,"Harvey Norman now got discount on the laptops until 20 march. Got free gift some more.
Also, has anyone found out if the service centre can help your install SSD?"
LG brand 14,"How much discount for i7 Gen 10 17 inch LG GRAM, huh? Are the free gifts additional to what's on the brochure?
Where's the link?"
LG brand 14,Go their website and see...
LG brand 14,"They never mention abt the free ram upgrade to 16gb by LG.
To my understanding the 8gb ram is soldered onto the mobo.
They will just need to add another 8gb onto the empty ram slot.
Also now mkt do have the 32gb DDR4 ram for both desktop and laptop.
moreover having 2 pcs ram of the same Gb will enable it to run on Dua."
LG brand 14,HN advertised the older LG GRAM 17z990 model not the latest 10th Gen model
LG brand 14,"no , HN already post the latest 90N"
LG brand 14,Here you go... See the red text got extra discount
LG brand 14,"Thank you
👌"
LG brand 14,"the harvey norman is a better offer than mine.
extra $130 off 2799
plus quite alot of free gifts from them 1tb ext hdd, wireless mouse etc
i believe the standard.free gifts for z90n - 8gb ram upgrade, carrying case, anti virus still applies ?"
LG brand 14,"I think so cos this one offered by LG. Ask you ah, did you manage to visit the service centre? Can they help to install the SSD?"
LG brand 14,"I'm getting my set now. Later I'll pop into the service centre and ask them to install an additional ssd for me
Edit - LG Service Ctr installed the SSD I bought"
LG brand 14,For the 17 inch 10th Gen model ALL the USB 3.1 ports are of Gen 2 type ie at 10Gbps transfer speed. This was just informed to me by LG
LG brand 14,"Thanks and enjoy your new gadget. Hope my service was good haha ^^"""
LG brand 14,"Thank you for your great service
👍😁"
LG brand 14,Wow. Any idea about the 14 inch? I have a NVMe external SSD. Hoping can have gen 2 speeds
LG brand 14,He sold you or he is from service centre? Haha
LG brand 14,"You check with @destiny88 lor
😁"
LG brand 14,All new z90n comes with gen 2 usb type a port
LG brand 14,"/edited
kudos to LG service staff ... good job !,!
at first, the staff told me that installation of extra ssd that separately purchased for latest 2020 z90n series is additional $85.60 incl gst
however, later the staff helped to check and says the 2020 z90n series come with free additional 8gb ram
if u ask them to help install the ssd together with the free 8gb ram, there will be no extra charge. which makes sense anyways.
you need to separately buy your own nvme ssd. i checked fuwell prices and while they are reasonable, it is far cheaper to order via amazon
samsung 970 evo plus   fuwell sells 1tb at 639
i got 2tb from amazon about 600+
if u plan to use this laptop for productivity for 3 years or longer
warranty cover 2 years, should consider one time have ample storage."
LG brand 14,"Thanks! Do you know if the hdmi version is 1.4 or 2.0? 1.4 cannot output 4k@60hz in RGB...
Still undecided on the LG gram 14. Build quality seems bad, design a bit dated and the screen seems to have uneven colours I notice on most display sets, the centre of the screen is warmer than the sides. But its so upgradable and port selection is good.
Anyone done any benchmarks on the 14 inch version yet? Heard there were some throttling issues on previous version..not sure if it still happens."
LG brand 14,"Can the ram be upgraded? If so, whats the max amount of Ram?"
LG brand 14,LG official recommendation is 24GB RAM. Anything more than that may or may not cause issues. I heard so far someone upgraded to 40GB RAM.
LG brand 14,"1.4. u want run 4k 60hz go usb c/thunderbolt.
New model has better thermal then old model."
LG brand 14,"Edit Reason - Mixed up default and installed RAMs
I have checked the DDR4 RAM speeds. The default 8GB RAM is 3200MHz. The installed 8GB RAM speed is 2667MHz . See attached photos
Bank 0 installed 8GB RAM Speed 2667


Bank 2 default 8GB RAM Speed 3200"
LG brand 14,"those of you who purchased the laptop, have you registered your laptop warranty on LG website?
a minor feedback i had for the staff was, previously when i registered my product a LG smartphone i could see warranty was 24 months for parts and labour
but for this laptop, i can't see the number of months. the staff do not have feedback for me"
LG brand 14,Is it the other way round e.g. Bank 2 is the default? Previously I thought when plainsman ran the test it showed 3200.
LG brand 14,"Can ask him to show the test results? Either case if the default RAM is 3200MHz then LG has installed for us a 2667MHz RAM then.
I used HWINFO64 and CPUZx64 and they also showed 2667MHz only"
LG brand 14,"thanks bros for helpful info here
now when i do the get speed i get
speed
2400
3200
i feel cheated !! the free 8gb is only 2400 speed"
LG brand 14,"When I ran the wmic MEMORYCHIP get speed it showed
Speed
2667
3200
It means the default RAM is 3200MHz whereas the installed RAM is of 2667MHz
See my previous attachments
Note :- LG rep just confirmed the default RAM is of 3200MHz. He'll escalate to his HQ for an answer and reply back"
LG brand 14,When I was at LG Svc Ctr and asked them about the 2nd 12 months registration the staff said no need to register
LG brand 14,tks pls keep us posted.
LG brand 14,"Latest news. According to LG they are now working something out on this issue
Meantime just use it first"
LG brand 14,Thank. Does the 990 series have the same issue too.
LG brand 14,Don't know. You'll need to check the speed of the soldered RAM if any and then compare its speed to the installed RAM
LG brand 14,"While the LG gram 17 slightly surpasses it in most respects, the LG gram 14 2-in-1 is nevertheless a superb device that comes with a touch screen and an included digital pen. So try"
LG brand 14,"My short review in using the ZENDURE Supertank 27000mah 100WH power bank with PD 100W to charge the LG GRAM 17 10th Gen with 80 WH battery. I use the APPLE 96W USB-C ac charger for charging the ZENDURE Supertank power bank.
Internet review of the ZENDURE Supertank 27000mah power bank with specs as below

Video reviews here



Firstly, charging the laptop
With the laptop at 16% battery level I'm able to use the power bank to charge it to 100%. The power bank indication is at 1%. This is done either with the laptop totally power off or its lid closed with BT/Wifi/Kb light turned off. With my previous CYGNETT 27000mah 100W PD power bank I can only achieved 80% of the laptop battery level before it stops charging with one blinking light still on the power bank.
Full charge of the laptop takes about 2 hrs
Secondly, charging the ZENDURE Supertank power bank
I'm using the APPLE 96W USB-C ac charger to charge the power bank with the default cable that comes with the power bank. The time it took was 2hrs 20min from 1 to 100%. According to YouTube reviews if you use the ZENDURE SuperPort 4 100W USB-C desktop charger you should be able to full charge the Supertank power bank within 1 hr????. The reviews are incorrect regarding the charging time. Actual charging revealed about 1hr 45 min for a full charge.

What I Like
1 Lighter weight at 500gm. Generally, most 27000mah power banks go into the 600+ gm weight
2 Has pass-through charging which many similar power banks lack
3 Has a feature to allow the charging of low power devices like smartwatches/wrist bands/ear buds/ear phones
What I Don't Like
1 Pretty thick. If designed flatter like others would be more portable
2 Not sure the default power bank charging cable's compatiblility with the APPLE 96W USB-C ac charger. Might have to search for another PD 100W20V/5A charging cable to shorten the charging time. Only way out now for fast charging the Supertank is to use the ZENDURE SuperPort 4 100W USB-C desktop charger
Notes
1 Can get the ZENDURE Supertank power bank from Shopee or from a shop CaseFactorie in Bugis Street
2 Unfortunately, the ZENDURE SuperPort 4 100W USB-C desktop charger is not available now at the Bugis Street shop but can get from Shopee
3 The APPLE 96W USB-C ac charger does NOT come with a USB-C charging cable so selecting a compatible cable is crucial for fast charging"
LG brand 14,"Was informed that the battery bank is unable to charge the laptop when the laptop battery level drops below 15%. Needs to use direct charging from an ac charger
Does this apply to USBC charger also? Or only power bank cannot?"
LG brand 14,"yes, 10chars"
LG brand 14,Yes to which? All USBC charger? Or only affects power bank?
LG brand 14,"@destiny88
I tried charging the 17 inch GRAM at 14% battery level with the Zendure Supertank power bank and it works. Did not try anything lower than that
I have revised my review
BTW does the 17 inch 10th Gen model supports WPA3?"
LG brand 14,"haha like i said cant remember 10% or 15% cannot charge already.forgotten which. seems like its below 10% cannot use usb c to charge.
Nice powerbank. sorry the one i introduce you not able to work as intended
hows the 17"" new 10gen gram working out?"
LG brand 14,"The LG GRAM 17 10th Gen is great for productivity work.
But now I realized it uses about 40% of my RAM when surfing the net and watching Youtube via Invidio.us. Need to increase the RAM to 24GB ah"
LG brand 14,RAM is meant to be used... haha. Does the Apple USB-C charger able to charge when battery below 10%?
LG brand 14,Regarding the APPLE 96W USB-C charger I'll need to test again. Will feedback here after my testing
LG brand 14,"Hi,
can u confirm that the 2020 LG 17"" comes with DDR4 3200 ram? I'm thinking of buying  base model and them upgrade with a stick of 16G DDR myself. H/w, seems that DDR4 3200 sodimm isn't readily available in SLS or online stores...There's many DDR4 2666 though."
LG brand 14,"Yes, the pre-installed RAM is of 8GB DDR4 3200MHz according to LG
ADATA has it but not sure whether it's available here.
I'm also thinking of increasing my RAM to 24GB because currently I can hit 40% of memory usage running Firefox browser and watching clips on FreeTube alone"
LG brand 14,"It's confirmed that the ZENDURE Supertank power bank can charge the new LG GRAM 17 with a battery level at 8%.
When charging the laptop from 8% battery level I can only achieved 89% charge when the power bank reached 1%
Did not test anything lower than that. See attached pictures



Sorry, did not read your post clearly.
Will test using the APPLE USB-C another day with less than 10% laptop battery level"
LG brand 14,"Currently 3200mhz ram is not yet available in sg. Most likely next month.prices wise will update here.
Wow 8% can charge. This power bank is the best i have seen for typce c atm. Legit surprised"
LG brand 14,Ok thank you very much
LG brand 14,"Quote from above link
On FireStrike, the 15W i7-1065G7 featuring Intels Iris Plus G7 iGPU still trails the Ryzen 5 4650U by roughly 10 percent.
Unquote
Look, 10% is unnoticeable lah
😁"
LG brand 14,Ok to answer your question properly. The APPLE USB-C charger is able to charge the new LG GRAM 17 at 9% battery level. See attached pictures
LG brand 14,"Thanks man
Just got my XPS 13 a few days back. Have some issues with the screen quality. Might just be returning it for the LG gram 14 instead..."
LG brand 14,"Woow, they allow to change from Dell brand to Lg .
As XPS 13 is from Dell ? Or I am wrong.
Me buying the 90N soon. Who is selling the cheapest. Any lobang ?"
LG brand 14,how to connect w/o ethernet port for wired connection?
LG brand 14,is USB c to ethernet adaptor the only Answer?
LG brand 14,"Just bought the 90N at J.point on 5/4/2020.
Going LG service centre tmr to do the Ram upgrade and free gifts"
LG brand 14,"Hi, could u share how much did u pay for it? shop name?"
LG brand 14,"went to service centre to do the 8gb ram upgrade. chk is 3200Mhz speed.
I intended to upgrade another 512 Gb storage by the centre  but was quote near to $300. They using the samsung higher end type.
Was also told by the service centre and technician the 2 year wnty will be void if I open the base to do the ram and storage."
LG brand 14,I also discovered that we need to tweak the wifi setting on the laptop to get good connection and speed.
LG brand 14,"Tweak what settings? Please share
Thanks"
LG brand 14,Guys got good lobang about this laptop please share.
LG brand 14,is the LG Gram screen's glossiness an issue for anyone?
LG brand 14,"i am wondering if I can use a USB-C PD wall charger not power bank for the LG Gram. If yes, any wall charger proven can work?
Some people experienced CPU throttling when using USB-C PD wall charger."
LG brand 14,is the computer slowing down a lot when using Apple USB-C charger?
LG brand 14,Just sit with your back facing a wall can leow
LG brand 14,"I'm using the
Apple USB-C charger to charge the power bank at home only. It is inconvenient for outdoor use for it's larger and heavier than the original LG AC adapter"
LG brand 14,"My daughter told me when she used the original  adapter during battery charging she can feel ""ant biting"" when her skin touch the laptop. Her body is grounded to the floor.
Thus I use a electrical test pen to touch the metal part of the laptop. The test pen lit up. Although the light is very dim , this show current leakage.
I did a google check for answer and it was told to be normal for some low end bad filtering adaptor. This can be rectified  by using a 3 pins cord with earthling.
Can any brother try it to confirm that they are also having the same too?"
LG brand 14,"thanks for share. i dont feel 'ants bite' since day one, using only the LG power charger that came with laptop. i bought 17 inch version
but, the free RAM upgrade they gave me only 2400mhz. will need head down svc centre ask for change to the correct RAM speed promised.
Does anyone know if LG service centre still open during Circuit Breaker?"
LG brand 14,thats a problem with low quality adapter. metal lenovo has this issue too. But hp elitebook which is fully metal doesnt have
LG brand 14,"if that is the case, then mostly is the adaptor problem. will call up LG .
As forthe ram speed ,I got the 3200 from the LG upgrade."
LG brand 14,"Call them. Maybe by appointment only.
I ordered a 16GB RAM 3200MHz from LG leow. Will arrive in May due to this cov19"
LG brand 14,"Is the LG power adapter 3 pin? All 2 pin adapters will have this problem. Experienced it on dell, Lenovo, hp and Microsoft surface when charging thru USB-C using a 2 pin adapter. No issues if you use a 3pinnmetal plug though"
LG brand 14,"If anybody interested in LG Gram 17inch 2020 @$2699 with freebie office 365pro and wireless mouse please pm me !
Outdated offer. Gotten a better offer @ $2600 without freebies .. is that the best deal ?"
LG brand 14,Why selling your set off? Any reason? Or you are a salesman?
LG brand 14,"it is using the normal 3pin wall socket type, but the other end to the power adaptor is a 2 pin type. Meaning no ""earth wire"".
most 2 pin have this problem but not all. If the power adaptor have a built in filter this will not happen.
We need electrical or electronic knowledge on this."
LG brand 14,"Nope. I am just sharing this deal !
I am considering among various laptops as well.. came across a Microsoft surface pro 7 i7/16gb/512gb matte black @ $2198 on courts few days back but didnt pull the trigger... now it is out of stock..  therefore looking for alternative right now and LG gram 17 is one of the candidates."
LG brand 14,Got try flipping the two pins on the power adapter to the other way round? It is said to help on Microsoft surface devices
LG brand 14,"woww. you also know yea. But this round it does not work.
Using another good qty  power adaptor with the same DC voltage solved  the leakage problem.
Will call up LG service on this matter."
LG brand 14,"How to fix it
Get a three prong power adapter: Just like your socket, some AC adaptors are also earthed which is the purpose of the third prong. This provides an extra layer of protection by taking out any rogue current that might end up shocking you or doing damage."
LG brand 14,"yes, LG should have done it, since the set cost more than 2 K"
LG brand 14,"office 365 offically dont have ""pro"" version, only home and personal,
$2699 not cheap la. i know those who gotten it cheaper lol."
LG brand 14,"If its brand new,
That was the deal i got , 2699 , from challenger. But seems the salesman sold it and later company says cannot sell anymore."
LG brand 14,like that very restrictive movement
LG brand 14,"Better that way especially in public places so nobody can see what you are doing over your back
😁"
LG brand 14,Btw apple USBC charger is it 3 pin? Won't cause the electric shock hor?
LG brand 14,$2600 - LG gram 2020 i7 version good deal to buy?
LG brand 14,"I just got a LG Gram 17. I found when I am typing, my right palm keep pressing and sometimes clicking the touch pad. This caused some issues. How do you guys handle this?

LG brand 14,"So far the only way is to turn off touch pad. Luckily it can be done easily using a function key.
Sent from HUAWEI LYA-L29 using GAGT"
LG brand 14,if have touchpad software install it. Got palm rejection setting
LG brand 14,"Yes. Touching doesn't cause issue but sometimes the touching clicks the toupad pad so it becomes right click. That causes issue.
Sent from HUAWEI LYA-L29 using GAGT"
LG brand 14,"Hi ,
Anyone know of any good deal to get this model?
Should I get it from Best online?
I understand that the free gifts of 16mb etc will need to collect from LG directly.
Any better deal that Best could offer?"
LG brand 14,"Best Denki website got $90 off $1600 purchased,
Free upgrade to 16GB Ram, Sleeve case, Anti-virus for 1 year and 2nd year warranty.[Terms and condition apply*]
additional FOC MS Office Lifetime version freegenuine license key on obtainable via PM.
Anyone looking for LG Gram can talk to me via PM, a few fellow forumers have purchased from me and is happy with my service and their purchase."
LG brand 14,Harvey Norman giving like 150 off though if you add to cart...
LG brand 14,"but they not giving away ms officelife time useage, Free upgrade to 16GB Ram, Sleeve case, Anti-virus for 1 year and 2nd year warranty., that will cost you $200, so which deal is better? clear choice ah"
LG brand 14,I think it's clear someone is about to get banned for advertising.
LG brand 14,"i dint say buy from me, best denki is also advertised by HWZ, so quoting HWZ is gonna get me banned then so be it. i dont own best denki, i dont own HWZ. dont see any issues with just stating what u getting with the purchase. Lobang SIC.
also i dint put any links to suggested retailer. no affiliation link either."
LG brand 14,"I see. Thought the free upgrades is provided by LG? Or that promo is over? Haha
Btw I realise when you add to cart in best denki website you get 100 off automatically. So means 160 off with free upgrade to 16gb if buy from best denki? If so then it's a good deal."
LG brand 14,"i believe the discount does not stack, so which ever is higher."
LG brand 14,Sure anot?
LG brand 14,"I just checked Best Denki's website. The coupon code is stackable. And it's also $90 off instead of $60 off with the coupon code BEST90. For the 14Z90N with i7-1065G7 configuration, the total price is $2,106, which is cheaper than Harvey Norman.
I also went on LG's website and checked the promo. The 16GB RAM upgrade, antivirus, free sleeve and extended warranty is provided by LG themselves and is available for purchases up to 31 May, and redemption period until 30th June. See for yourself here:
It seems like it should be available as long as you buy from an authorised retailer. So you can buy from Challenger, harvey norman etc as well.
As for the free Office licence, I have no comments. For me, I get an Office 365 subscription and share it with my family members, so my yearly cost comes up to only $30/year or less. If you do a quick Google search, a 1-user licence of Office 2019 Professional is available quite cheaply as well though not sure how legit"
LG brand 14,so u mean buying from BESK DENKI ONLINE now i get comm? u have no idea how retail works.
LG brand 14,"np, just saying whats available ^^"
LG brand 14,"Sure, no worries. Good to see this level of interest on this laptop"
LG brand 14,"This is you saying buy from me, not buy from Best Denki.
Don't buat bodoh lah.
People come to this forum to get opinions about tech stuff that isn't from salesmen in a store trying to sell wtv they have in stock, not to get opinions from salesmen masquerading as members."
LG brand 14,"FYI, I bought the LG GRAM 17 2020 from destiny88"
LG brand 14,Oh so he is a salesman after all.
LG brand 14,"No regret buying from him lah. Can get some extras as well
😁"
LG brand 14,"I'm sure it is. My concern is the problem of ethics, that he may be pushing this model in a non-objective manner in order to promote sales of his product. Especially when he's actively denying he is a salesman despite you showing otherwise, already tells me he's not very ethical, or why would he be denying it?."
LG brand 14,"No difference lah. Buy from him or from the shop what's the difference? Can get a good price with freebies and good support are what you want mah, no?
😁"
LG brand 14,"This is one of the very few places to get tech advice on local deals without an annoying salesman trying to push his wares. If the salesmen all come in and start pretending to be members, what's the difference between here and a store?
We will no longer be able to get objective opinions from real users because they'll all be salesmen pretending to be users.
Good deals are important, but getting objective information to make a purchase that satisfies your needs is even more important."
LG brand 14,"I don't find he's pushy mah.
I did my homework, clarified some issues with him and then made my buy decision
😁"
LG brand 14,"I wasn't saying he is pushy, I was saying in shops they are pushy, and this is one of the few places where there aren't pushy salesmen. There are people who are not as knowledgeable in tech as us, and they may be swayed by people pretending to be members and end up spending far more than they need to, or end up buying a product that doesn't fit their needs because somebody wanted to earn commission."
LG brand 14,"1st.I dint deny im a salesman, im saying u buying online i dont get comm.
2nd.This is a LG gram thread, if u not considering this model u come in here i also dont know what u come in for.
3rd.This is a forum, everyone and anyone can be a member and come comment and post things what-so-ever, u have issues with a post? report lor. u not the admin also what.
4th, People ask question i reply them what they wanna know, this is information for their purchase decision, u got the power to sway them to buy another model then do so, i wont flame nor report as everyone makes their own decision.
5th. share lobang for them and maybe i get something back in return, win-win nothing wrong with that, what i get in return has nothing to do with you also, u not my boss also.
6th. u come here want bring this thing off topic is like what a competitor brand salesman would do. but i doubt u are 1, but no need bring this off topic again.
any issues u not happy u can go shove it somewhere else. i wont bother replying what u trying to stir also le"
LG brand 14,"That's right, finally show your true colours.
Now everyone in this thread including your potential customers knows what kind of person you are and what kind of attitude they can expect when something goes wrong with their purchase. You've managed to do more to ruin your own reputation than anyone else could. Well done."
LG brand 14,"I think you have assessed him wrongly.
He's a LG salesman and he has given a great service. If you go to the store you'll see him there. What's the difference buying from him here and there?
Are you saying if you go to any store you'll definitely get great service from the salesman there?
You should know that if after a purchase any issue that arises out of the product you are supposed to go to the service centre and not the salesman?"
LG brand 14,"dont have to reply him, i believe you are the best person who knows what kind of service/follow up i do for my customer, this guy 100% is coming to this thread to stir something, lets just leave him alone. he is either a salesman himself who lost sales here to me or hes another brand promoter whos trying to get this thread close down.  best thing is we just ignore him. i already block and report already"
LG brand 14,"Okay, back to the main topic at hand...
Notebookcheck just did a quick review of the LG 14Z90N here:
Seems like performance is below average for an Ice Lake CPU, but I guess that is to be expected given the size and weight. Battery life is impressively long at 14 hours."
LG brand 14,Why its RAM used is DDR4-1866? I thought the RAM sold here uses the DDR4 3200 MHz? My LG GRAM 17 is getting DDR4-3200 MHz leh
LG brand 14,Good eye. Maybe a typo but i guess that could be a factor if really the case
LG brand 14,"I have been using LG Gram 14 2017 coming to 3 years already.
Battery capacity has dropped about 16% and find it a bit slow cuz it's a dual-core processor.
Other than that, do not have any issues with it. Love the screen, weight, and battery life maybe not so much now cuz it has degraded a bit"
LG brand 14,"100% a typo la haha,DDR4 dont have that kind of speed one hahaha"
LG brand 14,planning a upgrading anytime soon?
LG brand 14,waiting for it to spoil or LG to release gram with front-facing speakers
LG brand 14,"Unless LG does away with the num pad like the New DELL XPS 15/17.....
Taking some cues from the new XPS 17 LG could
1 have front facing speakers by re-designing the keyboard
2 have 4x USB-C 4.0/TB4 ports and PCIe 4.0 all these come with Tiger Lake cpu
3 new Tiger Lake CPU with dGPU
4 larger 97WHr battery
5 lower the screen to make the bottom bezel thinner and so has a smaller form factor. Forget about the LG logo there lah
6 4K touchscreen for its 17 inch
for its next year model lah"
LG brand 14,"Lai.

LG brand 14,"Meet up meet up.......and show off

LG brand 14,"Ooi, CB leh.

LG brand 14,"Fully agree...

LG brand 14,Sounds like really a good laptop!! Any good lobang for gram 17? Please share tks
LG brand 14,"Super light weight with long battery life as a productivity machine.
If you get the 17 inch I bet you'll never go back to anything smaller than that in future....not for me at least"
LG brand 14,"after 2.5 months with this, delivered quite fair bit of work ,including producting videos. alot of photoshop. everything runs ok. day to day productivity is smooth and quite fast.
am taking wifi 6 for granted.
shocker, the lan dongle that comes with it only support up to 100mbps! these days its no longer enuf as surfing speeds of 300-500mbps are noticeable and feels alot more smoother.
video editing wise, machine slows and stutters once u have 2-3 full hd footages in same frame concurrently. single frame with text and occasional simple efx and audio still smooth.
overall am definitely happy with this machine.
only gian is i see all the new games coming out, wonder if i shld hv got an aftershock instead. much heavier i suppose but 1.9kg, much faster graphics. guess u cant have everything..."
LG brand 14,"It's more of a productivity machine. Still not powerful enough for video editing and games like stuff. Before you buy you should watch Youtube and read net reviews mah.

just trying to push the limits of machine
my previous video editing laptop was a 2016 macbook 12"" with 8gb ram but i upgraded to m7 cpu. churned many videos with it

Screen uniformity issue it looks like most of the sets I saw have the same issue, some worse, some better. So I guess mine is normal.
Think I will just sell it haha. The weight is really good though"
LG brand 14,Don't sabo buyers lah. Bring it back to LG Svc Ctr and exchange for a good one. After that you can sell it
LG brand 14,"Haha I guess I'm just too picky ba. This year I tried Lenovo, Dell hp and now LG. All got uniformity issues where one side of the screen has a bit of reddish tint and slighter green tint on other side.
Maybe it's my eyes
Anyway I'm selling not cos of uniformity issue I took a look again and measured uniformity with a colour calibrator... Seems within the tolerance range. Probably just my eyes? but because the laptop isn't compatible with my 4k TV at 60hz for some reason. Not a hardware issue since it works fine with LG monitors. Probably a bug in the firmware somewhere but difficult to fix since they are from different brands?
Anyway, not to say the LG is bad or what. For most users it is a good laptop. Gen 2 usb-a ports on both sides pleasantly surprised when I tested for myself with my NVMe ssd, thunderbolt 3 port, large battery and super lightweight."
LG brand 14,"Has anyone plugged in their LG gram to a 1440p 144hz monitor before through hdmi? Realise I max out at 120hz thru hdmi port. Think probably the port has not enough bandwidth for full hdmi 2.0 since it has to drive 2 Gen2 USB ports, up to 2 NVMe SSD and thunderbolt 3 too"
LG brand 14,"From below
HDMI 1.4 supports at 30Hz
HDMI 1.4b supports up to 60Hz
HDMI 2.0 supports up to 60Hz
HDMI 2.1 can support up to 120Hz
I think the LG GRAM comes with HDMI 1.4 if I'm not wrong. If it's true then how come you are getting 120Hz?"
LG brand 14,"It is not stated. Called LG hotline before I bought but no one could give me an answer.
Destiny88 mentioned it's HDMI 1.4 previously but if it's HDMI 1.4, it can only drive 4K at 30Hz and 1440p at 75Hz.
However, when I tested in Best Denki on their LG monitor, I can manage to get 4K at 60Hz, which seems to mean that it supports HDMI 2.0.
But based on my experience so far, it seems like the HDMI 2.0 support is ""in between"", cos 4k at 60Hz doesn't work on my 4K TV and 1440p only works at 120Hz on my Acer monitor but this also means it is better than HDMI 1.4 which will cap at 75hz.
So I was just wondering if anyone has a 1440p 144hz monitor or 4k monitor who can share his or her experiences as well, so I can report the problem to LG or if officially, it can only support up to HDMI 1.4b.
The Usb-c to hdmi 2.0 adapter I have works fine at 4k 60hz and 1440p144, so not a big issue. Though I would prefer not having to use an adapter so I can reserve the usb-c port for charging.
Btw I realise the bios has a secret cheat code... Ctrl alt f7 can unlock advanced options. There's an option to enable ""fast charging"" though this doesn't seem to improve charging speeds."
LG brand 14,"When you tested at Best Denki using LG monitor was that monitor a 4K monitor?
Look at my above posting again. I think the LG GRAM could be using the HDMI 1.4b spec"
LG brand 14,"Yes, it was a 4K monitor, 3840x2160 running at 60Hz in full 8-bit RGB mode. I went back to double check yesterday.
Hdmi 1.4b supports 4k at 30hz and full hd at 120hz. See https://hdmi.org/spec/hdmi1_4b"
LG brand 14,"Your quote
There's an option to enable ""fast charging"" though this doesn't seem to improve charging speeds.
Unquote
Use for reverse fast charging a handphone using the USB-C port?
I tried the Ctrl Alt F7 it don't work leh"
LG brand 14,You must go inside BIOS first then press the key combination... You should see a new tab Advanced appearing. Looks like you can customise a hell lot of stuff inside this tab. I don't really dare to touch hahaha
LG brand 14,"Can you go to the old Windows sound control panel, then to Recording and see which device is set as recording device?
Anyway, an update on my case. In the end I managed to sell the laptop and go for UX425JA. Strangely, the UX425JA also have same issues with the HDMI port. Thus, I guess it is an issue with the Intel Ice Lake implementation of HDMI. Maybe personal preference, but I like the matte display on the Asus more. Obviously, the LG gram is far more upgradeable."

I've run that SSD externally with a heatsink on it as well. After few mins performing a cloning activity, the heatsink got scorching hot that you can't even touch it for a second."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"Personally, no comments on the choices made by individuals.
Hardware wise, it is an above average build compared to other similarly configured brands.
However, I wouldn't pay $1389 SGD for it."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"Don't take my word for it, but do lookup for reviews out there with this Ryzen 7 4700U. Probably the best performance you can get for the amount of money spent, i.e. best bang for buck. Been using AMD Ryzen CPUs on both desktops and laptop for years with no issues."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"I got mine at $1,250 previously though I sold it off shortly after. Think another member also sold it off.
If CPU performance is your only consideration then yes, $1,398 could be a good deal. But some other aspects which make this not so sweet of a deal:
- No fingerprint reader
- Horrible colours  cant display a decent shade of red
- Restricted to USB 3 Gen 1 speeds and only HDMI 1.4b need to use Type-C to output 4k60Hz
- Plastic chassis feels a little cheap
- Supplied power adapter is only 2 pin so you will get the metal tingling sensation when charging and you touch the lid
- GPU performance is better than iGPU but still pales in comparison with, say, a laptop with MX350 and above graphics.
So its kinda a neither here nor there laptop with the exception of the awesome CPU performance."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"AMD APU i would stay away.. seriously.. using Ryzen 5 3400G now and its horrible.. frequent hanging and crash. Already update BIOS, drivers all to latest but issue still occur..
until i went online to search for solution and changed a few settings and registry it become more stable from crash/hang a few times a day to once every few days.."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"That is why research before buy but sometimes is really heng suay as there is always a lemon units. Anyway laptop and desktop have different sets of issues, don't think its fair to compare like that."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"I've been using the Ryzen 5 3400G and its stable. Initial crashes for my case has nothing to do with AMD, but rather the motherboard maker pushing too much voltage to my CPU even on auto settings which is causing it to overheat and freeze/ shutdown. Lower the voltage from auto 1.54V to 1.3375V now, and everything works fine and significantly cooler.
I am not sure if you have identified the culprit for the crashes in your case? It could be a result of things like RAM incompatibility or PSU issues that cause the crashes."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"I believe it is a combination of plastic base and aluminum lid. But to me, it feels fine.
For the power supply, the one that came with my IdeaPad 5 14 Intel version came with 3 pins. Having said that, I rarely use it just like when I was using my ThinkPad E485. Since I can charge via Type C, I usually 90% of the time charge it using a Type C charger.
GPU wise, I think its to be expected for a 15W APU. A dedicated graphic solution like a MX350 will always be more ideal. But that may result in shorter battery life, and more heat. It also introduced some complication on my IdeaPad 5 where the HDMI don't work no matter what I do. I had to resort to using a USB type C to HDMI dongle to get the second screen to work."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Why does SSD run so hot? Hotter than HDD and almost as hot as low-power processor.

Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"Lenovo ThinkPad T14 probably coming out next month? Not sure how the price will be like for the AMD model though. Yoga Slim 7 also supposedly going to launch soon, although like no news recently.
HP envy x360 got new model, but not launched in SG yet. Probably in 1 or 2 mths time?"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"Not sure if the prices are competitive
Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,300 quite good already for amd. Oem usually go lower at 250nits and bad color accuracy. Screen wise cannot compare with MacBook.
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"so actually what is the min nit should one target?
also we can also upgrade lenovo 14"" overseas for better screen right?"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"The nits is not the issue. 300 nits is more than enough. The issue is the gamut -- only 45% NTSC or 57% sRGB. This means that it can't display a lot of colours properly, e.g. bright red is a bit orange on the IdeaPad 5 for example"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,can upgrade color ma?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"Can, just source for the FRU online and replace lor... Need to disassemble a lot of things tho"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"So you all just waiting for Yoga slim 7?
Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Yes. Waiting....
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"How much in SGD? Why not wait for SG release?
Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,what is polite payment????
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Being friendly?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"Just wait for sg release
Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"In SG the Xiaoxin Pro 13 is the S540-13ARE05. it should be launched in Singapore cos it appeared in PSREF, but not sure when."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,the flex also buang...the screen also CMI
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Can try for the QHD one think not bad also
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Is Lazada Atrix a reliable reseller ?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"Their prices are cheap.
But seems shady to me.
Beware
I rather play abit more to get from official retailers for a piece of mind especially for laptop where one component down means whole laptop useless."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"I dun work or any connection with Lenovo or Atrix.
Why is Atrix shady?
Or u just assume they are. They are 1 of the authorised reseller. If your laptop is faulty, even 1 component faulty, u still can go back to Lenovo for support.
There are reasons why manufacturer prefers resellers and distribution biz model and pricing is different."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"if get the items, good."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"I ordered the Ideapad 5 from them previously, so far so good.
Most laptop brands now come with a manufacturer seal. Just need to make sure the laptop box is sealed with no signs of tampering and the specs indicated at the side match what you bought."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"Purchased from them before, the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5. Was abit skeptical due to their reputation being abit smelly as linked by hippo.
But i gotten the set without any hiccups or drama. Set arrived sealed On-time and freebies as promised. Warranty commence on the same date as my purchase data Able to get verified on Lenovo SG website"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"Buy dun scare, scare dun buy.
Even if bought, can always resell and try another brand /model.
Afterall it's your own wallet.
note: 线上 vs 线下 / distros vs retailers, there will be difference in pricing.
Be smart and make the right choice.
At the end of the day there is still a Redmi 16 tio bo??"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"Why not highlight those good reviews?
If u are very worry about buying from a reseller, Atrix then buy direct but if u read buying direct from Lenovo, there are also bad reviews on their out sourced service center? So how? Build n manufacture or repair your own brand of laptop?
BTW your earlier context was,
""I rather play abit more to get from official retailers for a piece of mind especially for laptop where one component down means whole laptop useless.""
My replied to u,
Atrix is 1 of Lenovo authorised reseller
.
Anyway, move on with this topic. Your perception of
Lenovo reseller, Atrix
is ""bad"". U will not change your mind and I dun gain anything from Lenovo."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,you sure you not from atrix?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"Lets have a bet of $1k, I need fund for my new laptop... keen on UX425
To make the bet sweeter, if I am from Atrix or Lenovo, u win $10k, 1:10 ratio.
Again, no point debating on this. There are good and bad reviews, u paying for it, just buy accordingly to what pleases u."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"Yours may have some settings or heat/RAM issues
I have bought and experienced E585 Reyzen 7-Gen 1, T495 Reyzen 5-Gen 2, X395 Reyzen 5-Gen 2. I have not experienced anything like that, except on the E585 - the RAM got defected, and they arranged for an onsite replacement.
The ThinkPad are really well supported and there are frequent updates to make the computer better. I am waiting for the 4700 Ryzen Legion, it may not have frequent updates according to my use experience with Legion line."
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Is this a good deal?
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,If you ok with 8gb ram I rather get the latest envy 13 or the Asus ux425. Port wise and screen quality miles ahead of the Ideapad 5
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"Yes both envy13 and zenbook is recommended for Ultrabook.
Around 1.3k as well.
Awesome battery life around 10h"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"yes i did consider these models.
Just worried about the limited ram given that both the envy 13 and ux425 uses integrated graphics, it might eat into the 8gb ram
trying to get an ultrabook below 1.4k"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Check my pm.. same laptop with 10th gen i7 / 16gb ram / 1tb SSD at cheaper Price
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,"What kind of usage? Now that we are in phase 2, you can see for yourself the screen quality. Best to go challenger. You can see the price which they show as the wallpaper, the red is really muted on the IdeaPad 5 Vs other laptops"
Lenovo Ideapad 5 14,Go for screen with 100% sRGB

MAIBENBEN Laptops,"https://www.lazada.sg//products/i385...x&urlFlag=true
any one has experience with this China brand.
it seems to have good reviews in Lazada"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"I was interested as well. I feel the price vs specs is quite attractive. However I am hesitant because the warranty is going to be a problem. A lot of these China sellers always say X years of international warranty. However sending it back may be a problem due to the size and weight of the item. Thus, I feel it is better to spend more and buy one with local warranty.
If the laptop that you are considering is very cheap, then may be worth taking the risk."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"its legit. My colleague bought the $700 one. The metal doesnt feel good though.
The cheapest is 330 before $15 shop coupon, and you get full hd ips screen and 8th gen processor. At these prices i wonder why people bother with more expensive second hand laptops that have been used for more than 6 years.
The stock change quite often too. During the 11/11 sale you could get a laptop with 1650 for less than 600"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"if i see correctly, the local agent is based in Singapore and warranty is Singapore based too.
thats why i got attracted if Singapore has local agent for after sales."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"I see. I went to check again, and yes, most of them have a 1 year local agent warranty. But do note that I saw 1 with 1 year international warranty."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,i send a chat query to the company.  Waiting for their response.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"They replied that they have local service centre at Eco-Tech@Sunview
So looking good!"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Good to know they have a local service center. The location does seem a bit remote in the Benoi area though.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Because when you buy a reputed brand that's 6 years old, especially when it's a business laptop, parts are easy to find. I can buy a brand new 3rd party battery with quality LG cells inside produced last year for a 10 year old ThinkPad. If you buy God knows what brand, the second it breaks out of warranty for whatever tiny part even the power button, and I have experienced this before with cheap laptops the whole thing has to be thrown away."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Looks good. I went to taobao and check the reviews as well as some YouTube videos. Think I'm gng to get one too just to play
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"I have a almost 10 year old Thinkpad that's still working fine, but even a 3rd party battery cost about $80? And cannot run much apps and slow to start up. A brand new laptop for 300-500 use for 3 years or so everyday less than $1"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,N4100 is weak processor......
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Nonsense.
My Chinese laptop has an Apollo Lake. I use it to perform packet captures and traffic analysis. More than up to the task."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Can it play Crysis?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"For a 330 bucks laptop, and your expectation is to play Crysis? Really?

The reality is that no current Intel integrated graphic is capable of playing Crysis smoothly regardless its a 50 bucks CPU or a i9 processor. There is no difference between a GPU pushing 5 FPS vs <30 FPS since they will be unbearably slow to play.
With an option for 8GB of ram with the N4100, most people can use it for work, watching movies, etc. And this does not come with some crappy TN panel and eMMC drive. In this case, the N4100 laptop is a very good buy @ below 400 bucks."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,n4100 is faster than third gen core i3/i5 laptops ppl sell for 300 in carousell
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Yes, in multi tasking and GPU I believe. This is due to 2 more physical cores and newer GPU."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"dont understand why people buy old laptops tho when new ones are less than $100 more.
dead battery, 1366x768 screen, no ips, no hardware acceleration for video, 35w processor, heavy, bad physical condition."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"I feel refurbished laptops used to be popular because of the high prices of laptops with decent performance. With the onslaught of cheap Chinese laptops, with decent enough processors, it does negate the benefits. There are certainly some concerns about cheap Chinese laptops, which we read quite often. For me, I am most concern about the battery used. Longevity wise, I can't complain for the price, as long as it doesn't bite the dust within a year. With local warranty here, I think it adds a little bit of confidence to their products.
I think it is still good that people are buying old refurbished laptops because it is environmentally friendly. The amount of electronic waste is actually staggering."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Same sentiments on the amount of electronic waste.
I got an A condition refurbished Zbook 15 for $500 - i7 4800mq, Quadro 2100m, 16gb, 256gb Samsung 840 Pro, 3G modem.
Upgraded it further to 32gb 4 slots plus a 512gb mSata, AC wifi Surprisingly no whitelist
So there are good deals online."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Just ordered one and try. Got the 4GB 240GB HD. Will get another 4GB at aliexpress if I can open the casing to upgrade.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,maibenben? current prices are expensive.it used to be 333 for the n4100 and 389 for the mx250 version.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"The 6-cell battery I bought from Aliexpress for an old notebook became 0mAh in less than 2 years
Makes you wonder about the batteries in refurbished laptops and China laptops"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"I got a similar one 14"" thin and light with J4105/8GDDR4/128GSSD. J4105 is desktop version of N4100, faster but consume more power, somehow still can go into passive-cooled laptop. These China brand all same same. 1688RMB paid 338SGD exclude freight. Buy it because I need a thin and light <1.3kg for web surfing, torrents and Youtube, and bring around on holiday, watch movie on a plane. Uses a standard 12V power adapter included, so it can use a power bank with PD2.0 while on a plane. I do not need warranty as I can do basic repair. Parts from TB is cheap. This laptop can do 1080p but not 4k. Gaming is out also. Display is my main complain, poor viewng angle and colour, the spec they put is BS. Built quality is acceptable, cannot compare with main stream but decent. Comparing to similar spec laptop in SG market, this is really cheap I did quite some checking around, including similar one at Popular . But if you need something better please spent more and get higher spec laptop. Higher spec laptop is much more expensive, so might as well buy branded one here! Self upgraded to 512G SSD from my old laptop and did some DIY on the cooling they have it on Youtube, different brand but all same same lah. Used for 6 months already."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Btw, it has pre-installed working Chinese Win10, which was reinstalled to English version! Working Office2019 cost another $4."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Yes, the prices went up significantly. The 8GB 240GB config used to be around 380 before the 15 of 330 store coupon and before any credit card discount. Now its 480+."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"I guess its a risk, and depends on risk appetite of the person. For the price, I feel the battery you got from Aliexpress should be quite inexpensive, relative to the official store cost.
Moreover if you look at my case where I got the E485, the battery actually started acting up few months after I bought the laptop. As I needed to use it, I did not immediately RMA it. Now they are telling me the warranty is only a year, i.e. warranty over. So things like battery issues may also happen with big brands like Lenovo and Dell. I experienced same issue with Dell corporate laptop where the new laptop refuses to charge over 50%. On site repair person had to replace the battery to get it to work."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"TS link don't work
Only found this link if i search shipped from SG
Can't see any specs.
What's 240HD 120HD?
Anyone got the lappy already and can give a review?"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Still waiting for mine...
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"I also got E485 so far so good. Enough for the kids to study from home. Used for more than a year. Came across this. Might as well try. Anyway don't know 4G and 8G, around $100 difference.
Last check aliexpress selling 4G ram 30 or so."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"brand, parts?don't think ppl old laptops to bring out. sometimes as a backup"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"There is a model that comes with Samsung OLED display which was very enticing for me. I don't think you get laptop with OLED screen at below 2k was 1.9K during the brand flash sale. But on the flipside, it is quite a lot of money to pay for a Chinese PC maker, and I feel the laptop will struggle with cooling the components due to the slim chassis."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"So which model is worth to get for this brand? Branded laptops in sg are always overpriced but underspec. Lol
Sent from Samsung Galaxy Note 8 using GAGT"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"The cheapest is worth it. The rest, not so since you can get a new lenovo ryzen for less than 800"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"I agree that you should not spend too much money on it. Do be mindful that its only got a year of warranty, and not sure how good is the after sales service. I also observed that the specs are quite good, but given how slim the chassis are, I am not sure if it can keep up with the heat output.
If you are looking for higher end specs, do consider brands like Aftershock which tends to give you better specs for lesser price. The big brands typically charge you significantly more for higher end specs."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Thank you very much to both of you. I will take note.
Sent from Samsung Galaxy Note 8 using GAGT"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,anyone bought it? any reviews?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Received it yesterday. I am very impressed... It looked expensive. My elder kid with his E490 thinkpad kept asking is his didi new notebook better than his. Hahahaha
The quantity is at least twice the amount I paid for. Get the cheapest version with 240gb hd and get a stick of 4gb ram yourself. Come with win10.
If you need for simple office work, study or work from home kind, then this is a very good buy."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"HI, Have you upgraded the ram? How easy is it to do this?
Thanks."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,You got the laptop with the Pentium Silver processor?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"thanks for the review.
how long did delivery take?
which model did you buy and how much?"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"I gotten the pink color, grey oos, the cheapest version with n4100, 240gb hd and 4gb ram. Then I ordered another 4gb ram from aliexpress @ 26. Will install once it arrives. Took around 3 weeks. Ordered on 23 Apr..
Got it @ $337, with the coupons."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Waiting for ram shipment. Got @ 26, 4gb ram."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Yes, the N4100 4 cores. For simple office works should be suffice..."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"I think it is still a good price, despite its not the lowest I've seen. For light usage/ home base learning, this works perfectly. There will be no other big brands that can offer such a good value since this comes with a superior screen, SSD vs eMMC, and upgradable dual channel ram vs single channel soldered ram."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Is the version n4100 with mx250 at $536 worth it?
The ryzen with Vega8 is around 400 plus.
The screen bezel looks bad though."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Not worth. The CPU is too weak, so even if you have a dedicated MX250, the performance is still going to be poor. The CPU bottleneck will be very apparent in this case because you can only game a low resolution and graphic settings.
The Ryzen option is more attractive at this price point."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"The n4100 with mx250 is worth it when it was selling for $360 dos version. A few weeks ago they jack up to 500+ not worth anymore
The problem with the ryzen 2500u is that the idle power consumption is high and battery is 36wh which is very little. You can expect 2-3h battery life only.
Of course if you dont intend to use as portable laptop then it is a non-issue. processor is slightly faster than intel 6th gen quad core, and faster than 8th gen Core i5-8250U"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"If it is 360, which is slightly higher in price than the version without the MX250, then I agree it may be worth it. However don't expect good gaming performance on it still because of the severe bottleneck from the CPU. In addition, I am also concern about the cooling system since most laptops running N4100 have passive or minimal active cooling solution. If they use the same cooler with the MX250, it is gonna be very hot. The non Max Q MX250 draws 25W at load, vs 6W for the N4100."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"So the $360 N4100 is the only one worth buying?
What's the estimated N4100 battery life for that base model?"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,i dont know battery size. if assume worst case 36wh battery /7w cpu = 5h
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"It will be difficult to estimate without knowing the capacity of the battery. Generally, the N4100 is very frugal when it comes to power consumption. However if you add the MX250 in there, that changes the equation quite significantly. As pointed out earlier, the Max Q version of the MX250 should ideally draw 10W, though it draws more in practice. The non Max Q version of the MX250 is expected to consume 25W as per specs.
If it is only the N4100, I think the laptop will be passively cooled. But in this case, I don't think passive cooling is going to cut it. So if you further add an active cooling to the laptop, it will impact battery life further."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"From what it sounds, look like only the cheapest model at $337 is worth buying, pity only available in pink atm."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Don't get me wrong. It really depends on what you are looking out for. The MX250 model, it is actually very attractively priced. So if you think you want to have some light gaming, it may be a decent alternative. If you are looking at just light usage and with an emphasis on battery life, then the version without the MX250 should address your needs better."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"is their xiaomai 6a worth it at it's current price?
8gb ram 240ssd @ $551.70"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Bro, can share the link to buy the 4gb ram from aliexpress? Thanks"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Bro, do you have to reinstall the chinese OS to english yourself? Can share how to get working office2019 for $4? Thanks"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Price for Xiaomai 6A has went up quite a bit since i bought one unit in April. Unless you are in a hurry to get one. else you can wait for better discounts
In case if you need a review you can check out the below link on youtube
Do take note that the review is on the older Xiaomai 6A with MX150. The one on sale at lazada comes with MX250.
For work, entertainment and light gaming this machine does it all for an affordable price. Tested with L4D2 with under max settings the games is pretty smooth. And considering a 15.6"" lappy at 1.7kg is a plus point. Got the 16GB RAM with 240GB M2 SSD. After receiving the unit I added a spare 240GB normal SATA hdd to it."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Mind sharing how much you got it for?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,I got the 16GB RAM 240GB SSD for SGD 494 after the 15 promo discount
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"More than $100 more now.
How's the usage so far? Are you bothered by the thick bezel?"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Overall user experience has been great so far. I had 2nd thoughts about the celeron CPU in the first place as well. After watching the youtube review and weighing in the usage and purpose for this laptop, felt that getting the celeron version fits the bill.
Not really bothered by the bezel because the top and sides bezels are still slim. It's only the bottom bezel that is thick but that's due to the webcam placement and the logo. Comparing Xiaomai 6A with the Damai E527 and felt that E527 has thick uniform bezels on all sides."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"You're lucky you got it before they jacked up prices of everything again by $100. Now not worth buying.
Can't wait for mine to arrive this week. 240GB increased from 311 to $436"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"All these entry-level Chinese laptops don't get enough attention and love.
8GB of memory, an M.2 SSD, backlit keyboards and metal chassis is a lot of value for that $400.
I own three and have not regretted since. For their price, even if one fails I can get another one and still not be out of cash. The N and J series processors have enough beef to get all the typical computing requirements done properly."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"oh ya. i got it mixed up with the E527. that bezel really damn thick.
i shall wait and see if the price will drop. thinking of buying as an ""upgrade""to WFH since the price is really good."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Really attractive at the price you gotten. Using for normal browsing?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"People are generally skeptical and rightfully they should when they see some bespoke Chinese brand. To be honest, I would not have paid attention to it as well if not because someone mentioned it here.
The specs vs dollar and upgradeability is something that the big brands will never match."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,N4100 is just 10% slower than 7th gen i3. Can use it normally without worry
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Will get it if the price is back to 3xx. Haha. Just feel that it's not worth with the current price.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"If above 500, think not so attractive liao."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Received it today. Glossy screen looks really amazing. Not sure about srgb should be more than 50% but less than 100%

freebies included are mouse and mousepad and keyboard cover
Comes with Western digital SSD which is surprising. I had a few China PC and laptop, normally they use SanDisk or unknown brand

Uses torx screws. Hard to remove. Laptop doesn't have any fans. Doesn't get hot. Audio is above average. Speakers are loud.

Pros:
Good fhd ips screen for the price
Processor able to decode 4k hevc and vp9 YouTube
Good speakers for laptop
branded SSD
Top and base made of metal
Genuine windows 10 1909 Home
Cons:
Ram not upgradable
Small battery of 38wh 3-4h depending on use
Only 1 USB 3 slot.
No hdmi output there is thunderbolt logo tho
SSD partition is split with boot partition in between c drive and d drive. Impossible to combine unless reinstall or use partition wizard to rearrange resize D drive smaller, move the 2 small partition to end of drive, then combine c and d
Drivers are unsigned. If you reinstall Windows you need to go test mode in order to install unsigned drivers
No kensington lock
For the price of $311-$40sold away SSD=$271, it's worth it. Opting for 8gb ram model is recommended"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Agree if the ram is soldered, then better to get the 8GB version. I have the impression that RAM is upgradeable. For slightly above 300 bucks, it is certainly a good buy for the specs."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Nice review of the Jinmai 6. For an ultraportable and work based requirement laptop this model fits the bill.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"For those with the same jinmai 6, under power options > advanced power setting you can limit maximum processor state to 50% while on battery. this reduces power consumption from 10w to 5w and battery life will increase from 3h to 6h. Using the windows power saving mode did no difference to power consumption
Best to set windows update to manual thru gpedit.msc and turn off windows defender.
Also the usb c port is thunderbolt, supports 4k 60hz resolution and pd charging"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Oh no... I ordered another 4gb from aliexpress... Haiz...
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"i realised even from the poster at maibenben listing, you can see the ram is soldered
You can cancel order if ali havent ship"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Never realised that. Anyway use it for my E490. No issue..
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Just in case if any potential buyers have questions on the Maibenben products. Can chat with the  seller in Lazada and they will be happy to answer your questions.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,their response on the lazada one is quite fast de...
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Not worth it liao, can close thread."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Take note, its not thunderbolt 3. It just supports display out, PD charging & 5gbps Data transfer"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Really not worth anymore? Ive been comparing the prices and seems like they are pricing very competitively.. considering if I wanna pull the trigger on the Nvidia 150M model or not
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"you are right. couldnt find in hwinfo despite the tb icon beside the usb c port

I found out the panel is a chimei 1376 and notebook reviews says that the panel is 99% srgb

Battery life is about 8.5h of web browsing"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"I think the price is still very competitive just that you may not get the same pricing as before comparing to early adopters of Maibenben products. My take is this: if you think the product meets your requirements and the price justifies you to leave your cash with them, go for it and don't look back anymore. Sometimes good deals may just fly past without you knowing it. ^^"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Its amazing value that you get a 90+% sRGB panel here while we are complaining about getting some crappie LCD panel from Lenovo.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Was an unexpected surprise. My previous laptop a few years ago was Toshiba Chromebook 2 which had 98.5% sRGB screen, using a n2840 fanless processor installed windows 10

Then upgraded to onda xiaoma 31 gold, which has not as good screen and fanless n3450. Sold it away at price I bought at after 2 years.

Now this maibenben has a good screen, fanless n4100 processor. 3 generations of using atom processor"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Maibenben gave me a $15 discount for their $100 increment.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Faster than 3rd gen U chips yes, but not the M chips you find in cheapo X230s"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"100 points difference is insignificant. 7w vs 25w.
i have x230 too

try playing 4k hevc or vp9 videos
Also it is no longer cheap. i bought mine at lazada for $168-$8dbs-$30 sold away ssd =$130
now can only buy for $230. tn monitor is ****, need to spen $70 for ips upgrade. fhd ips not possible unless you buy $40 adapter.
plus cracked brittle plastic case. need to replace battery with chip for $40. it is not cheap in the end. penny wise pound foolish"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"anybody tried the Ryzen-based models? how good also are the ""ADS"" screen models?"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Not bad siol! Consider it as rebates for 3 Cai Bng meals LOLOL
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"I pulled the trigger on the XiaoMai 6A with N4100, MX250 With 8GB ram. Total damage about $615 after the coupon which feels a bit Ex.. hope it arrives fast"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,I bought the same as you but i chose 16GB Ram with 480GB SSD. Arrived in 9days. So far so good.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Do share how it is when you get it then. I agree it is a little expensive for the class of CPU, and I hope they implement a decent cooling solution for the MX250."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,ips is lg technology. ads is similar used by non lg companies. if youre lucky you might get a high srgb monitor
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"n4100 is a weak 7w processor, unlike 15w u series. Need to manage expectation.
windows 10 is really resource heavy with windows updates and defender running all the time. to make it bearable and achieve long battery life you must make driver backup with doubledriver and reinstal windows pro or enterprise. this givws you option to pause windows updates run manually and disable windows defender."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Many models OOS
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Why not Windows 10 LTSC?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,I'm not buying any N4100 laptop with price creeping into the S$600 range
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Its worth if it is below 400., assuming no dedicated graphic card."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Any recommendation for casual gaming?
Sent from Henabi virus using GAGT"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Look for cheap 2500u or 3200u ryzen laptops
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Looks like my cpu performance is slightly faster than i3 7100u
MAIBENBEN Laptops,I am using the Xiaomai 6A with MX250 Graphics to play CSGO and Dead By Daylight.. but of cos with Low settings. So far so good to my expectation.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Currently looking at Dianas E527 with the good screen Ryzen 5 2500U 8Gb 6Gb usable and 240 ssd for 560 after minus 20 coupon is it worth it?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"for this price, just get local Lenovo laptop, buy from online.  it gives you more years of warranty and support."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"If you can stack more discount coupons, i.e. 40 off 400 HSBC card discount, it will be an even better deal. For the specs, I think the price is decent."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Unfortunately I didnt get the bank Voucher as I know gotten the standard charters but I dont have standard charter card
MAIBENBEN Laptops,how the battery life and does it heat up and produce lot of noise ?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"That same specs used to be 470 2 months ago.
Their ryzen series not worth because the batteryis 38wh and first gen mobile ryzen has high idle power. so you can expect only 2-3h of use. If you dont intend to use like laptop then its not a problem.
If you intend to game, you need dual channel ram so need to add in upgrade cost"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Managed to get it at 550 after 30 bucks voucher Ryzen 5 2500U 8Gb ram donno single or dual channel 240gb SSD
Mainly used by fiancée for simultaneously YouTube music, FB game pool and slot machines and FB feed viewing and a few chrome tabs to find jobs and ms word for writing cv and job application.
As my Budget is 600 max as myself is going to lose my job soon by end of year due to no more funding.
The usable ram will be 5.9gb out of the 8 as 2Gb for the graphics. At most can get a sodimm  2nd Hand to make it 16gb 14gb usable.
As for SSD does anyone know the default 240gb is it nvme m2 slot? Does it have a slot for sata SSD as I have a spare zotac mlc 240 ssd which I want to put in.
I tried lenovo via educator pricing almost I get from Lenovo is n4000 8 gb and 512ssd and cannot add as will void warranty."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"if you dont mind poor battery life then its ok. similar to buying 8th gen core i7 but cheaper.
you can look youtube reviews. i think got space for 2.5inch."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"She mostly going to use it at home so I think the battery life still can be over come
Thats good for the 2.5 spot"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Battery life I cant really tell as of now since I have been plugging it with power at home. But I notice that whenever I powered it on the next nightas I normally use it at night , it says full charge at 20-30mins.  So I am not sure why as the night before it was full charged at 100%.
Quite hot if I played game with it, normal wise should be ok. As onboard have 2 GPU. 1 is integrated and 1 is the MX250. So only for games, it will auto use MX250, normal usage will be the onboard gpu.
Soundwise - Not much noise."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,When did you get it and how much was if when you got it? I realised the price keep changing.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"The jinmai 6 N4100, 8GB , 240GB SSD @420 still worth it?"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"if you dont mind the fact that it used to be $370 for those specs, sure"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Battery life will drop overnight for sure. But you should check if there is a feature to allow for other devices to charge over USB even when you off the laptop. This is one of the features that will drain battery real quick, and generally on by default."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Is that price after coupon discounts, i.e. store and credit card discount? Last I saw yesterday, if you have a HSBC card, you can apply the 40 off 400 to get it to 400 bucks. For 400 to 420, I think it is still a decent buy, though I agree after seeing the sub 400 bucks pricing previously, its hard for me to buy it above 400 bucks."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"While the Ryzen chip is not the latest and greatest, it is still a very good processor for the price. At 600 to 700  bucks, you can only get a laptop with very low end specs if you go for the bigger brands.
In any case, I pray that you can get a stable job soon."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"ChuWi HeroPro 14"" N4000,8G/256GB @ $369 b4 vouchers @ Lazada."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Hi bro,
Thanks 🙏 deeply appreciate.
I also wish all bros in the forum to stay healthy and safe ya."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"While the price is good, do note that N4000 is dual core, while N4100 is quad core. So while its cheaper, it can be quite a bit slower."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"I actually gotten 329 for Acer and Lenovo with the flash sale and educator but fiancée want something powerful enough to do all the 3 things simultaneously so n4000 dont cut it esp the fb gaming, movie streaming 1080 and scrolling fb with video auto play on or playing via mini window"

MAIBENBEN Laptops,Ya emmc option
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Personally I will take 527 cos of the screen for office work you will be looking at the screen 8 hours so to me thats impt
Next will be the keyboard layout and the key travel for typing but that I cant comment as I dont any to compare
As for specs 8Gb and ssd is good combo."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"OT a bit since we are on this brand.
anyone using their
? review looks ok, wanna try"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Thank you! Hopefully it is compatible with additional ram
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Hi, sorry for late reply, I got the laptop at $634 excluding the $15 discount. I opt for 16GB Ram and 480GB SSD."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"I will pay up to $700 for an Atom-powered Chinese laptop that uses a metal body, ships with at least 8GB of memory and a 256GB stick of socketed M.2 2280 SSD, and has a backlit keyboard.
Everything else in that price range by big name OEMs are either using 4GB memory with crappy eMMCs and weak plastic bodies with lousy keyboards.
The Chinese OEMs are catering to a market niche here."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"So far from a tear down video there are 2 dim slots just Donno my 8Gb comes in single channel or will they give 2x4 there is one m.2 nvme slot and sata 2.5 slot
That where I got conflicting youtube some showed the laptop came with sata 2.5 some showed its has nvme but since Lazada ad said it has pcie ssd I presume is nvme so sata slot will be empty for spare we when it has ssd + hdd config"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"700 bucks is too much for the specs you listed actually. In this case, the Maibenben laptop is almost matching your requirement at around 400 bucks after discounts in the recent tech sale. I think its only missing the backlit keyboard. M.2 SSD, you can easily get a decent 256GB at close to 100 bucks."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"The drive doesn't really matter actually. If it comes with NVME, then just get a 2.5 inch SSD if you need more storage, vice versa. I don't think it will make any  difference in day to day usage whether the OS is on the NVME or SATA SSD. NVME is really just good when it comes to sequential transfer rates, and there is no tangible benefits when it comes to OS boot up and app start up times."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,700 for an Atom laptop? I'll pass 🤣
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Gotten the laptop 527 but is reasonable for the price, sound nah, screen surprising very good and crisp and sharp with good Color and wide viewing angle.
Keyboard tactile but non mechanical, slight wobbly but not mushy, very good to type. Track pack smooth feeling and big but out of the box too high sensitive.
My unit like many bro unable to activate but I dont bother gotten a pro key for 10 bucks during flash sale.
The m.2 drive is not nvme is WD green m.2 drive identified by the WD dashboard software.
Donno is the ram or the drive a lot of stuttering. Will be putting in my spare Zotac mlc 240gb drive. Then native drive came in 106Gb x 2 partition had to use gpart to delete the 2nd part and stretch the c part to full."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,Actually is not bad for general useage. Good thing is battery can last very long.

MAIBENBEN Laptops,Is this a local sg brand?
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Hi all,
I'm currently looking at the following 3 laptops
1. CHUWI Lapbook Pro 14
2. TECLAST F6 PLUS 13.3
3. MAIBENBEN JINMAI 6  13.3
All using intel N4100 Quad core processor
I'm still undecided. Understand that mbb has one year local warranty while the other 2 you have to send it back to China?
thanks for advice
Sent from HUAWEI YAL-L21 using GAGT"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"So far from Lazada I dont see much good review of chuwi though youtube many ppl praising teclast good but any service centre in sg, at least maibenben has a service centre is the far west of Singapore.
Though I must say my 2500U not as powerful as expected but your n4100 should be below that. N4100 is iris pro? Also for the 2500U for a 8Gb model dual channel only 5.9 gb usable not enough for whatsapp gmail Fb game youtube all active at once. Hence suggest a higher 12 or 16gb model.
Also the WD green ssd is not a true nvme is only m.2 format and is SLOW, I will be putting my zotac mlc 240gb inside it which is much faster than the WD green SSD.
Also the original SSD Donno why for a 240 gb still partitioned into 2 112GB portions I have to use g part to del the 2nd partition and
extend the c partition to full. So if you dont want hassle just get the 480gb at least you have 2x 224gb. Also I assume 480gb will perform better than 240gb SSD"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,chuwi always have battery issue. teclast have qc issue. if you dont mind can return easily buy
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Maibenben is China brand apparently with Singapore agent.
On YT search for budget Chinese laptop and you will find reviews of this and other brands."

MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Wow! Props!
You collect notebooks?"
MAIBENBEN Laptops,nope. i sell away the ones i dont use.
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"It is a shame the prices have been creeping up for the Maibenben laptops. I have not gotten 1 myself to try since I already have a laptop. But I recently got the ZiMai 12.5 inch portable monitor from them in the mid year sale @ 99 bucks after discounts, and I am impressed by the quality. While I don't have any equipment to measure the brightness and color accuracy, the supposed Sharp IGZO screen is almost as good as the MSI monitor I am using that cost 6 to 7 times the price. Visually, the color and brightness is good. Monitor is thin and light, HDMI and Type C connects are firm, and no visible backlight bleeding. As compared to the Anmite 15.6 inch 4K portable monitor I purchased a year back, backlight bleeding is quite obvious, and the monitor flickers frequently.
My only complain will be the buttons which are flushed with the chassis and thus, difficult to locate and press. Because of the light weight, it makes pressing the buttons even harder.
Overall very pleased to recommend it. 12.5 inch works for me but is actually quite small. I was considering the 13.3 version, but not willing to pay extra 20 bucks for a 0.8 inch increase in size. Moreover some reviews there seems to point to some issues with the screen."
MAIBENBEN Laptops,"Ok update,
I have updated my 2x4GB 5.9GB usable Samsung 2666 sodimm with 2x8GB 13.9GB usable Crucial 2666 sodimm.
But sets works in dual channel but one thing I use cpuz to check out the settings of the rams. For the crucial it recognised 2666 but the freq its using hovers between 400 and 1,193 so = 2386 not reaching the 2666 and the timing corresponding to the tighter timing at 2333.
But becos now due to 13.9GB available, my fiancée usage does not exceed that amount hence no page fault ie No usage of virtual page file is needed which makes its smooth.
Also I have added in an Zotac premium mlc 240GB sata 3 SSD. And clone the is over and ran crystal mark. The Zotacs crystal mark is 1.5x of the WD green m.2 sata that came with the laptop.
So relegated the WD green to data storage.
So learning point: maybe for ram upgrading try to buy back Samsung 2666 sodimm modules.
Definitely swab out the WD green and I saw other even worse not getting a international brand but maybe better performance? Ssd.
But nonetheless for the pricing though I didnt get it at its cheapest still very competent laptop for multimedia, Facebook gaming, sch, and biz 15.6 inch laptop
And I must say the screen is even better than my office assigned IBM Lenovo thinkpad"
