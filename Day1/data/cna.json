The US and the world are less safe as a result.Expect friends to reduce reliance on the US further as they hedge their strategic bets. Many partners have limited capacity and choices and may find the available alternatives, such as China and Russia, to be more unpalatable.But let\u2019s be clear, many allies now trust the US\u00a0less than at any time since World War II. The damage to the country\u2019s image and reputation will be hard to repair.TROUBLE IN THE WHITE HOUSEEven before the recent events came to light, the administration\u2019s foreign policy has been refracted through the prism of domestic politics to an unprecedented degree. The White House\u2019s alleged efforts to leverage almost US$400 million in military aid to Ukraine for dirt on a political rival reinforces this view.Less than two decades removed from post-Soviet independence, Ukraine struggles to manage internal divisions and rebuild democracy.Turkish soldiers with US-made M60 tanks drive through the town of Tukhar, north of Syria's northern city of Manbij, as Turkey and its allies continue\u00a0their assault on Kurdish-held border towns in northeastern Syria. (Photo: Aref TAMMAWI/AFP)The US Congress\u00a0decision to launch an impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s actions is draining time and attention of the White House, Congress, the State Department and other parts of the government.As the process drags into 2020, Washington will have little time to focus on alliance management.Fine points generally fall to dedicated public servants, but leaders set the strategic direction. Without leadership, friendships drift apart. Thorny issues cannot be delegated to mid-level managers.Yet, the president\u2019s inner circle lacks the bandwidth to help resolve, for instance, the dispute between US allies Japan and South Korea.Impeachment inserts a new gratuitous element of unpredictability that factors into the calculations of US friends. If the president\u2019s decision in Syria is instructive, allies will gird themselves for a leader whose gut tells him to turn the country inward when under pressure.US BETRAYAL OF THE KURDSPresident Trump explained his decision to abandon Kurdish allies who helped take back northern Syria from Islamic State fighters by reminding that he campaigned in 2016 on ending \u201cendless wars\u201d.In Trump\u2019s worldview, national interests are narrowly defined, values are largely irrelevant, and much of what happens outside US borders are other people\u2019s problems.Initially slow to grasp the rapidity of the disaster he had wrought in Syria, the president defiantly tweeted, \u201cI hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d. Over 18 years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Trump has been\u00a0oblivious to the emerging security vacuum and the risk that America\u2019s enemies could once again use favourable conditions to bring the fight to its doorstep.The abrupt decision led to the predictable collapse of a delicate truce in Northern Syria. Turkey\u2019s ensuing assault on the Kurds claimed hundreds of lives and left at least 176,000 people homeless.More than 100 Islamic State\u00a0fighters detained by the Kurds escaped, their whereabouts unknown; the Islamic State\u2019s ability to reconstitute itself amid the tumult has grown.The Kurds then\u00a0watched helplessly as Russia and Turkey carved up the border region. Syria\u2019s other ally, America\u2019s long-time adversary Iran, will also benefit from the precipitous US withdrawal.Syrian Kurds carrying photographs of loved ones killed in the Turkish offensive protest against the carve-up of their northeastern heartland by Ankara and Moscow. (Photo: AFP/Delil Souleiman)A SILVER LINING?Those searching for a silver lining may find it in the bipartisan condemnation of the White House\u2019s conduct in Syria and congressional leadership\u2019s efforts to reassure allies from Jordan to Afghanistan.Trump still operates under constraints. Intense criticism from the president\u2019s own party over self-dealing led him to revisit using his own hotel to host the 2020 G-7 summit.In the near-term, France, Germany and Japan will also participate in damage control. Of course, these guardians of a rules-based order are not immune from populist temptations, nor can they afford to back blindly a US government that dismisses pan-European institutions and threatens security ties to extract short-term economic benefits.Some like-minded friends might see American isolationism as a reason to join in defending international principles, as suggested for Asia earlier in Trump\u2019s tenure. Big trade deals are getting inked, just not with the US.Countries such as Australia and India, for example, may enhance cooperation to counter a more powerful China.In the South China Sea, as Beijing asserts itself, European and Asia-Pacific countries have conducted joint patrols in defence of the global norm of freedom of navigation.Yet, even if the differences that complicate collective action were finessed, virtually no configuration of countries\u00a0would be a sufficient substitute for engaged American leadership.The country\u2019s military and economic strength is still unmatched, and it plays a unique convening role. Forming international coalitions to protect well-established norms will be harder, especially given that this administration often works to erode them.AMERICA ALONEAs doubts grow about US commitment to treaty allies, some countries will invest more in their militaries or make temporary friendships with strange bedfellows.Others will place a renewed premium on keeping options flexible, selectively partnering when national interests happen to align in a more multipolar world.US President Donald Trump attends a multilateral meeting on Venezuela in New York, Sep\u00a025, 2019, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. (Photo: AFP/SAUL LOEB)The hedging will also take the form of a more pragmatic engagement of China and Russia. Even a nationalist Japanese government firmly anchored in the US alliance system has taken noticeable steps to improve ties with Beijing.America is learning the limits of its global influence under this president. Few have acceded to US demands to cut ties with Chinese telecommunications behemoth Huawei over security concerns.BUSINESS AS USUAL?There is a growing recognition that life after Trump may not mean a return to business as usual.That could be healthy if US\u00a0parties can forge a consensus around engaged US leadership in the world focused on diplomacy, alliances and the power of the country\u2019s example as key pillars.America\u2019s partners will be watching the impeachment process and presidential elections for clues to see if the principal architect of today\u2019s international system is intent on further unraveling.But they aren\u2019t waiting to see if Trump\u2019s brand of diplomacy is a passing phase. Restoring US allies\u2019 lost trust will be central to securing a safer, more prosperous world.That process will take a number of years, if not decades or more, and will test anew America\u2019s remarkable capacity for self-renewal.Atman Trivedi is a managing director at Hills & Company, International Consultants and an adjunct fellow at the Pacific Forum.

We will continue to have more outbreaks in the infected countries. Neighbouring countries are at high risk and for some the question is when they will be infected,\" Eloit said, stressing that controls were difficult to implement.The spread of African swine fever has not only ravaged the Asian pig population, but also sent international pork prices rocketing and hit animal feed markets such as corn and soybeans.It has also weighed on results of agricultural commodity groups due to weaker feed demand for hog breeding.China's hog herd was more than 40per cent smaller in September than a year earlier, its farm ministry said earlier this month. But several in the industry believe the losses are much greater.Beijing issued a series of policies in September aimed at supporting national hog production and securing meat supplies.Eloit said the measures were adequate but needed to be fully implemented.\"There is a difference between what is decided on paper - I do not think there is any concern here - and how we actually get to apply them on the ground especially in countries that are very large, which have a wide variety of production,\" she saidIn Europe, the situation is different because outbreaks mainly concern wild boars, Eloit added.African swine fever has been found on farms in eastern Europe but its spread had been mostly contained, due mainly to tight security measures implemented in some countries.(Reporting by Sybille de La Hamaide; Editing by Veronica Brown and Mark Potter)"}}, {"url_id": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/former-falklands-foes-swap-statuettes-at-vatican-12048550", "content": {"url_label": "Former Falklands foes swap statuettes at Vatican", "text": "VATICAN CITY: Argentine and British bishops exchanged statuettes of the Virgin Mary in a powerful sign of reconciliation 37 years after the Falklands War between the two nations, in a ceremony on Wednesday (Oct 30) led by Pope Francis.Britain's Bishop of the Forces, Paul Mason, handed over a statuette of Our Lady of Lujan, Argentina's patron saint, to his Argentine counterpart, Santiago Olivera.Argentine troops had abandoned the figure as they retreated from the Falkland Islands in 1982, and the British had taken it home with them, placing it in a cathedral in Aldershot, southern England.In the swap, Bishop Olivera handed over a replica of the statuette to be taken back to the Catholic Military Cathedral of St Michael and St George in Aldershot, where prayers are offered for the fallen of both sides.Francis -\u00a0who is Argentinian - presided over the swap in the Vatican's Saint Peter's Square, then accepted a sip of mate, the country's traditional drink.The statuette is itself a copy of the 1630 original, which is in the Basilica of Lujan, a city near the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, the Catholic Church of England and Wales said in a statement ahead of the event.\"I immediately realised what a good opportunity it was, not only to return the statue, but also to demonstrate a united faith across two countries that have experienced political division,\" the Church quoted Mason as saying.Argentinian troops occupied the Falklands in 1982 but were ousted by a British military task force after a brief war which cost the lives of more than 900 troops.Britain rejects Argentina's requests for dialogue over the long-term future of the Falklands, which lie off South America in the South Atlantic, insisting there is nothing to discuss since 99.8 per cent of the islanders voted in a 2013 referendum to remain a British overseas territory.Argentina claims it inherited the remote islands, which it calls the Malvinas, when it gained independence from Spain.

This study, \"provides objective evidence of fetal exposure to acetaminophen in utero.\"Earlier research showed that acetaminophen can cross through the placenta, Wang noted. Because the metabolites, or breakdown products, of the drug appear to linger for nearly two days, researchers are able to get an estimate of maternal acetaminophen use in the hours before delivery.For a window on the possible impact of acetaminophen exposure on babies' risks of developing certain neurodevelopmental disorders, the researchers turned to data from the Boston Birth Cohort. That database includes only births that produced a single child. It excludes babies conceived with the help of IVF and those born with major birth defects.Wang and her colleagues focused on 996 mother-infant pairs, for whom there was sufficient cord blood in the samples for an analysis of acetaminophen metabolites.At the time of the study, the children's average age was 9.8 years, with 257 having been diagnosed only with ADHD, 66 with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) only, 42 with both ADHD and ASD, 304 with other developmental disabilities and 327 who were developing typically.All of the cord samples contained some detectable acetaminophen, the researchers note.When they compared children with cord blood containing the highest levels of acetaminophen metabolites to those with the lowest levels, they found a significant association between acetaminophen metabolite levels and neurodevelopmental disorders.Those at the highest levels were 2.86 times more likely than those at the lowest to have been diagnosed with ADHD and 3.62 times more likely to have an ASD diagnosis.Because metabolite levels were measured only around the time of birth, the researchers can't say anything about how often the mothers took the drug or at which points during pregnancy, Wang said. \"Our study opened inquiry for further investigation,\" she added.Dr. Hyagriv Simhan isn't ready to tell his pregnant patients to stop using acetaminophen.\"There are some limitations to the study,\" said Simhan, executive vice chair, obstetrical services at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. \"First, the acetaminophen metabolite levels in the cord blood only reflects acetaminophen use around the time of delivery and doesn't reflect exposure to acetaminophen during other points in the pregnancy,\" he said.\"Also, although the authors tried to account for the reason that acetaminophen was used, this process was fairly limited in this study,\" Simhan noted in an email. \"Thus, this makes it harder to separate the effect of acetaminophen itself from the underlying reason for the use of acetaminophen.\"Beyond that, Simhan said, \"in the grand scheme, the effect described in this study is not a large one.\"SOURCE: https://bit.ly/2Jy4603

A country\u2019s ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker.\u201dIn the same vein, the new head of Australia\u2019s treasury, Steven Kennedy, said:The most important long-term contribution to wage growth is labour productivity.For my money, they could say the same about \u201ccarbon productivity\u201d, an idea that is going to matter to us more.Labour productivity is notoriously hard to measure; measuring changes in it is harder still.It is relatively easy to measure in the jobs we are doing less of these days, such as making washing machines; harder to measure in the jobs we are doing more of, such as caring for people.And it is less important than you might think. People are not a particularly finite resource. Allowable carbon emissions are.CARBON IS THE INPUT THAT MATTERSThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says net carbon emissions will have to be reduced to zero by 2050.That means we have a carbon budget; a limited amount of greenhouse gases we can emit from here on. It would make sense to use it wisely.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) at their 48th session in Incheon, South Korea, 1-5 October 2018. (Photo: AFP)What I am proposing is a target for \u201ccarbon productivity\u201d \u2013 the amount of production we achieve from each remaining unit of emissions \u2013 as a means of helping us cut overall carbon emissions.It is easy to calculate: Gross domestic product divided by net emissions. We already measure GDP, and we already measure emissions in tonnes, albeit unevenly.We are going to need huge increases in carbon productivity, much more so as a result of cutting emissions than increasing production.Things that are good for labour productivity might well be bad for carbon productivity. For example, replacing a sweeper with an air blower is good on the first count, bad on the second.MEASURING CARBON PRODUCTIVITYA target, or at least a widely published measure, could be introduced at a national level to focus government minds on what is important and what is not, and assist in allocating resources. Solar farms would become more likely to gain support than coal-fired power plants.Regulatory resources might be redirected in surprising ways. While a small number of large emitters constitutes an easy target for policymakers, if those large emitters are efficient, the government might find it has to move its focus to the larger number of small inefficient emitters.It could also help us think about how we resolve the conflict between the perceived need for economic growth and the need to substantially cut emissions. Both would be important, but the measures that achieve both would be the most important.Accounting debates about whether to carry forward international credits would be rendered meaningless.David Peetz is Professor of Employment Relations in the Centre for Work, Organisation and Wellbeing at Griffith University.

The US and the world are less safe as a result.Expect friends to reduce reliance on the US further as they hedge their strategic bets. Many partners have limited capacity and choices and may find the available alternatives, such as China and Russia, to be more unpalatable.But let\u2019s be clear, many allies now trust the US\u00a0less than at any time since World War II. The damage to the country\u2019s image and reputation will be hard to repair.TROUBLE IN THE WHITE HOUSEEven before the recent events came to light, the administration\u2019s foreign policy has been refracted through the prism of domestic politics to an unprecedented degree. The White House\u2019s alleged efforts to leverage almost US$400 million in military aid to Ukraine for dirt on a political rival reinforces this view.Less than two decades removed from post-Soviet independence, Ukraine struggles to manage internal divisions and rebuild democracy.Turkish soldiers with US-made M60 tanks drive through the town of Tukhar, north of Syria's northern city of Manbij, as Turkey and its allies continue\u00a0their assault on Kurdish-held border towns in northeastern Syria. (Photo: Aref TAMMAWI/AFP)The US Congress\u00a0decision to launch an impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s actions is draining time and attention of the White House, Congress, the State Department and other parts of the government.As the process drags into 2020, Washington will have little time to focus on alliance management.Fine points generally fall to dedicated public servants, but leaders set the strategic direction. Without leadership, friendships drift apart. Thorny issues cannot be delegated to mid-level managers.Yet, the president\u2019s inner circle lacks the bandwidth to help resolve, for instance, the dispute between US allies Japan and South Korea.Impeachment inserts a new gratuitous element of unpredictability that factors into the calculations of US friends. If the president\u2019s decision in Syria is instructive, allies will gird themselves for a leader whose gut tells him to turn the country inward when under pressure.US BETRAYAL OF THE KURDSPresident Trump explained his decision to abandon Kurdish allies who helped take back northern Syria from Islamic State fighters by reminding that he campaigned in 2016 on ending \u201cendless wars\u201d.In Trump\u2019s worldview, national interests are narrowly defined, values are largely irrelevant, and much of what happens outside US borders are other people\u2019s problems.Initially slow to grasp the rapidity of the disaster he had wrought in Syria, the president defiantly tweeted, \u201cI hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d. Over 18 years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Trump has been\u00a0oblivious to the emerging security vacuum and the risk that America\u2019s enemies could once again use favourable conditions to bring the fight to its doorstep.The abrupt decision led to the predictable collapse of a delicate truce in Northern Syria. Turkey\u2019s ensuing assault on the Kurds claimed hundreds of lives and left at least 176,000 people homeless.More than 100 Islamic State\u00a0fighters detained by the Kurds escaped, their whereabouts unknown; the Islamic State\u2019s ability to reconstitute itself amid the tumult has grown.The Kurds then\u00a0watched helplessly as Russia and Turkey carved up the border region. Syria\u2019s other ally, America\u2019s long-time adversary Iran, will also benefit from the precipitous US withdrawal.Syrian Kurds carrying photographs of loved ones killed in the Turkish offensive protest against the carve-up of their northeastern heartland by Ankara and Moscow. (Photo: AFP/Delil Souleiman)A SILVER LINING?Those searching for a silver lining may find it in the bipartisan condemnation of the White House\u2019s conduct in Syria and congressional leadership\u2019s efforts to reassure allies from Jordan to Afghanistan.Trump still operates under constraints. Intense criticism from the president\u2019s own party over self-dealing led him to revisit using his own hotel to host the 2020 G-7 summit.In the near-term, France, Germany and Japan will also participate in damage control. Of course, these guardians of a rules-based order are not immune from populist temptations, nor can they afford to back blindly a US government that dismisses pan-European institutions and threatens security ties to extract short-term economic benefits.Some like-minded friends might see American isolationism as a reason to join in defending international principles, as suggested for Asia earlier in Trump\u2019s tenure. Big trade deals are getting inked, just not with the US.Countries such as Australia and India, for example, may enhance cooperation to counter a more powerful China.In the South China Sea, as Beijing asserts itself, European and Asia-Pacific countries have conducted joint patrols in defence of the global norm of freedom of navigation.Yet, even if the differences that complicate collective action were finessed, virtually no configuration of countries\u00a0would be a sufficient substitute for engaged American leadership.The country\u2019s military and economic strength is still unmatched, and it plays a unique convening role. Forming international coalitions to protect well-established norms will be harder, especially given that this administration often works to erode them.AMERICA ALONEAs doubts grow about US commitment to treaty allies, some countries will invest more in their militaries or make temporary friendships with strange bedfellows.Others will place a renewed premium on keeping options flexible, selectively partnering when national interests happen to align in a more multipolar world.US President Donald Trump attends a multilateral meeting on Venezuela in New York, Sep\u00a025, 2019, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. (Photo: AFP/SAUL LOEB)The hedging will also take the form of a more pragmatic engagement of China and Russia. Even a nationalist Japanese government firmly anchored in the US alliance system has taken noticeable steps to improve ties with Beijing.America is learning the limits of its global influence under this president. Few have acceded to US demands to cut ties with Chinese telecommunications behemoth Huawei over security concerns.BUSINESS AS USUAL?There is a growing recognition that life after Trump may not mean a return to business as usual.That could be healthy if US\u00a0parties can forge a consensus around engaged US leadership in the world focused on diplomacy, alliances and the power of the country\u2019s example as key pillars.America\u2019s partners will be watching the impeachment process and presidential elections for clues to see if the principal architect of today\u2019s international system is intent on further unraveling.But they aren\u2019t waiting to see if Trump\u2019s brand of diplomacy is a passing phase. Restoring US allies\u2019 lost trust will be central to securing a safer, more prosperous world.That process will take a number of years, if not decades or more, and will test anew America\u2019s remarkable capacity for self-renewal.Atman Trivedi is a managing director at Hills & Company, International Consultants and an adjunct fellow at the Pacific Forum.

That was also the previous threshold for the working holiday visas.The Australian Tax Office said it was considering whether to appeal the decision.It added the ruling only affects a minority of working holiday makers \"who are also residents, and only those from countries affected by a similar clause in the double tax agreement with their home country\".In the case decided Wednesday, the British woman lived mainly in a Sydney sharehouse and stayed for the most part in the state of New South Wales -\u00a0meaning she was considered a \"resident\" for tax purposes in Australia.According to the ATO website, others - who travel from place to place - can be classed as \"foreign residents\" for taxation.\"In our view it was very clear, when the tax was introduced in 2016, that it discriminated against foreign workers and breached several international tax agreements,\" Taxback.com CEO Joanna Murphy told the ABC.The public broadcaster estimates up to 75,000 backpackers could be in line for a refund worth hundreds of millions of dollars following Wednesday's decision.The government had originally sought to implement a levy of up to 32.5 per cent, but this was met with outcry by farmers who rely on working-holiday makers for seasonal labour."}}, {"url_id": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/missing-tourist-cambodia-amelia-bambridge-search-family-12047836", "content": {"url_label": "Family joins desperate search for Brit tourist in Cambodia", "text": "KOH RONG, Cambodia: The family of a 21-year-old British tourist who went missing on a Cambodian island a week ago boarded boats with authorities Wednesday (Oct 30) to continue a meticulous search around the waters and dense jungle territory.The desperate search for backpacker Amelia Bambridge on Koh Rong includes more than 100 army, navy and police personnel as well as relatives and volunteers.Bambridge did not check out of her hostel on Oct\u00a024, while her bag and phone were later found on party spot Police Beach, where she was last seen hours earlier.Nearly 200 army, navy and police personnel scoured Koh Rong island in southern Cambodia for sixth day to find tourist Amelia Bambridge (Photo: AFP/TANG CHHIN Sothy)The desperate search for backpacker Amelia Bambridge on Koh Rong includes more than 100 army, navy and police personnel as well as relatives and volunteers AFP/TANG CHHIN SothyHer family members scrambled to the island to help with the investigation and have also been active on social media asking travellers for possible clues.Brother Harry Bambridge posted a video on his Instagram showing him sitting on a racing boat with Cambodian officials.\"Still no Amelia,\" he wrote.Amelia Bambridge was last seen at a beach party around 3.30am on Oct 24.
