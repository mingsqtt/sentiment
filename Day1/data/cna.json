An R value above one can lead to exponential growth.The Imperial team estimated that by early May, between 12 and 15 million people in the 11 countries \u2013 Austria, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland \u2013 had been infected with COVID-19.By comparing the number of deaths counted with deaths predicted by their model if no lockdown measures had been introduced, they found some 3.1 million deaths were averted.\"Measuring the effectiveness of these interventions is important, given their economic and social impacts, and may indicate which course of action is needed to maintain control,\" the researchers said in a summary of their findings.A second study by scientists in the United States, published alongside the Imperial-led one in the journal Nature, estimated that anti-contagion lockdown policies implemented in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France and the United States prevented or delayed around 530 million COVID-19 cases.Focusing their analysis on these six countries, the US\u00a0research team compared infection growth rates before and after the implementation of more than 1,700 local, regional and national policies designed to slow or halt the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new\u00a0coronavirus.They found that without anti-contagion policies in place, early infection rates of COVID-19 grew by 68 per cent a day in Iran and an average of 38 per cent a day across the other five countries.Using econometric modelling normally used in assessing economic policies, they found lockdowns had slowed the infection rate with \"measurable beneficial health outcomes in most cases\".Download our app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the COVID-19 outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"}}, {"url_id": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/george-floyd-protests-france-adama-traore-12815990", "content": {"url_label": "George Floyd protests in France give bereaved family new hope for justice", "text": "BEAUMONT-SUR-OISE, France: Since the wave of protests triggered by the brutal killing of George Floyd reached France, protesters have been chanting another name too: Adama Traore.\"They died in exactly the same way,\" said his sister Assa Traore. \"Adama carried the weight of three officers on his body.\"Adama Traore was celebrating his 24th birthday on Jul\u00a019, 2016, when three police officers restrained him using the weight of their bodies.

Increasing domestic production and higher fish imports will not be sufficient to meet the region's growing demand,\" the FAO said.The report is based on information gathered before the COVID-19 outbreak, which has led to a decline in global fishing activity as a result of restrictions and labour shortages due to the health emergency, the FAO said."}}, {"url_id": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/hong-kong-protests-national-security-law-china-target-12815868", "content": {"url_label": "Hong Kong security law like 'anti-virus software': Beijing official", "text": "HONG KONG:\u00a0A sweeping national security law that will soon be imposed on Hong Kong will be \"like installing anti-virus software\", a top Beijing official said on Monday (Jun 8), in a speech that warned protesters had gone \"too far\".The comments by Zhang Xiaoming, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, were the most detailed from a senior party cadre since Beijing announced plans last month to outlaw subversion, secession, terrorism and foreign interference.His remarks came a day before the restless city marks one year since huge and often violent protests erupted, raging for seven straight months in the most direct challenge to Beijing's rule since the city's 1997 handover.\"Once in force, this law will be like installing anti-virus software into Hong Kong, with 'One Country, Two Systems' running more safely, smoothly and enduringly,\" Zhang said, referencing the model by which China allows Hong Kong certain freedoms and autonomy denied to its citizens in the mainland.Opponents fear the law - which is currently being drafted in Beijing and will bypass Hong Kong's legislature -\u00a0will bring mainland-style politics to a business hub supposedly guaranteed freedoms and autonomy until 2047.On the mainland, anti-subversion laws are used to stamp out dissent.During his speech, Zhang repeated Beijing's assertions that the law would only target an \"extremely small number of people\".\"The opposition camp radical separatists have been mistaking the central government's restraint and forbearance for weakness and timidity,\" he said. \"They have gone too far.\"Millions of Hong Kongers hit the streets last year during the months of rallies, the culmination of years of rising fears that Beijing was prematurely eroding the city's freedoms.But Beijing has portrayed the movement as a plot by foreign powers to destabilise mainland China.\"The opposition camp ... wants to turn Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity, a bridgehead for the external powers to oppose China and the Chinese Communist Party and a chess piece which external powers can use to contain China,\" Zhang said.During last year's protests, Zhang's office and Chinese state media previously said issues like a lack of housing and the high costs of living may have fuelled the unrest.But in recent months Beijing has instead cast the city's political crisis as a national security threat.\"From my point of view, the key problem in Hong Kong is not an economic problem, nor a livelihood problem concerning people's housing and employment ... It is a political problem,\" Zhang said.The planned law approved by China's parliament has also proposed allowing mainland security agents to set up shop in Hong Kong for the first time.Zhang dismissed \"rumours\" they might make arrests and send suspects to the mainland.\"National security organisations have to follow the laws strictly when they are handling cases in mainland China, how is it possible for them to become unconstrained in Hong Kong?\" he said."}}, {"url_id": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/british-uk-slave-trader-statue-race-imperialism-debate-12815586", "content": {"url_label": "Felling of slave trader statue heats up debate on UK's imperialist past", "text": "LONDON: The toppling by anti-racism protesters of a statue of a slave trader in the English port city of Bristol has given new urgency to a debate about how Britain should confront some of the darkest chapters of its history.The statue of Edward Colston, who made a fortune in the 17th century from trading in West African slaves, was torn down and thrown into Bristol harbour on Sunday (Jun 8) by a group of demonstrators taking part in a worldwide wave of protests.Statues of figures from Britain's imperialist past have in recent years become the subject of controversies between those who argue that such monuments merely reflect history and those who say they glorify racism.Colston donated widely to charitable causes across his home city of Bristol, which named a street and several buildings after him.

Here\u2019s why", "text": "NOTTINGHAM: Intermittent fasting is a way of losing weight that favours flexibility over calorie counting.It restricts the time you are allowed to eat, which reduces calorie intake by limiting opportunities to eat. That\u2019s the theory, at least.A popular version of intermittent fasting is the 5:2 diet, which involves eating a very low-calorie diet (about a quarter of usual calorie intake) for two days each week and unrestricted eating on the other five days.This approach has worked well for some people, but not everyone. In our latest study, we found that people cheat on their intermittent fasting diet, without realising it.CHEATING ON YOUR DIETSConducted over three days, the study aimed to find out how eating and physical activity changed around a period of calorie restriction.A group of male participants completed two trials. On the first trial day, they were told they would have a very low-calorie diet (about 700 calories) the following day.Throughout the rest of the day, we tracked how much the participants ate and we assessed their hunger before and after each meal. Their physical activity was also monitored throughout the day.(Photo: Unsplash/Bruno Nascimento)The next day, participants ate the very low-calorie diet, and we monitored their physical activity. The morning after completing the low-calorie diet day, we measured their food intake at an unrestricted breakfast and assessed their hunger before and after the meal.Each participant also completed a control trial that followed the same method. During the control trial, participants ate a typical diet (about 2,800 calories) instead of a very low-calorie diet.We found that participants ate 6 per cent more on the first day of the study and 14 per cent more at the unrestricted breakfast on the low-calorie diet trial. This was despite hunger levels before and after each meal being similar to the control trial.This suggests participants ate more because they knew food intake would be restricted the following day, rather than because they felt hungrier.LESS PHYSICAL ACTIVITYPhysical activity was also 11 per cent lower the day before eating the low-calorie diet, and 18 per cent lower while eating the low-calorie diet.Interestingly, low-intensity physical activity, such as washing the dishes, which tends to be spontaneous behaviour rather than consciously planned activities, was the most affected component of physical activity.Man eating food with disposable chopsticks from a styrofoam container. (File photo: Unsplash)We found changes in eating and physical activity behaviour occur before, during and after a day of low-calorie dieting. These behavioural changes reduce the likelihood of intermittent fasting leading to weight loss.For a diet to lead to weight loss, calories burned must exceed calories consumed to produce a calorie deficit.Intermittent fasting diets assume that the large calorie deficit produced by fasting or very low-calorie dieting is not recovered during the unrestricted period, so the calorie deficit is preserved. But our study shows that eating a little more and reducing spontaneous physical activity may be enough to recover almost half of this calorie deficit.The calorie deficit may also be reduced further at subsequent meals after a very low-calorie diet day.WORTH THE SACRIFICE?Earlier studies support our findings. Skipping breakfast for six weeks was shown to reduce physical activity and increase calorie intake at later meals. This was enough to fully compensate for calories skipped at breakfast.This raises the question: Is fasting or severe calorie restriction worth the sacrifice?Weight loss from any diet is always likely to be lower than expected. Compensatory mechanisms defend against a calorie deficit far more strongly than a calorie surplus.In scientific studies of intermittent fasting, participants are often guided by a dietitian on how many calories they should eat on the unrestricted days. Even with this support, participants in these studies still lose less weight than would be expected if the calorie deficit had been fully preserved.Our study highlights what and when compensatory behaviours occur. This information can be used to improve the effectiveness of intermittent fasting diets.Being more mindful when eating before and after a period of calorie restriction and incorporating exercise into diet plans, could help increase the likelihood of intermittent fasting leading to weight loss.Intermittent fasting is not a miracle diet, but some people may benefit from its flexibility, and with a few minor adjustments, it could be even more effective.David Clayton is Lecturer in Nutrition and Exercise Physiology, Nottingham Trent University.

What threat or threats are they being protected against? Who is doing the protecting? And how is protection being provided?In its classic form, national security involves protecting nation-states from military aggression.More precisely, as Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter states, it is about preventing or countering \u201cthe threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\u201dNation-states now face other threats, including cyberattacks and terrorism, although such attacks generally must be sponsored by one state against another to threaten a country\u2019s territorial integrity or political independence.Hence, these threats really qualify as subsets of military security.Indian paramilitary soldiers stand guard during security lockdown in Srinagar, Indian-controlled Kashmir on\u00a0Aug\u00a014, 2019. (File photo: AP/Dar Yasin)Climate change, on the other hand, poses an existential threat to many island states as a result of rising sea levels, and similarly endangers already arid countries by contributing to desertification and water scarcity.TRANSCENDING BOUNDARIESMoreover, whereas the world of 1945 was almost entirely defined by nation-states, today\u2019s security experts must also focus on threats that transcend national borders.Unlike military aggression, phenomena such as terrorism, pandemics, global criminal networks, disinformation campaigns, unregulated migration, and shortages of food, water, and energy do not necessarily threaten the political independence or territorial integrity of a particular state.But they do endanger the safety and well-being of the world\u2019s people.The distinction between national and global security is not just semantic.It goes to the heart of the third question: Who is doing the protecting? National security is the province of national governments, and of a fairly small group of homogeneous people within them who traditionally have focused almost entirely on military security.Those establishments have expanded in recent years to take account of issues like cybersecurity, health security, and environmental security, but only at the margins.Thinking in terms of global security, by contrast, opens the door to participation by a far wider group of people \u2013 starting with mayors and governors, who are directly responsible for the safety and welfare of the residents of their states, provinces, and cities.WHOSE ROLE IS ITSince the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, for example, US city and state officials have been actively engaged in preventing and protecting against future attacks.They are as likely to talk to their counterparts around the world as national diplomats or defence officials are.Even more broadly, global security has no official designees.CEOs, civic groups, philanthropists, professors and self-appointed leaders of every description can launch and join efforts to keep all of us safe. Indeed, the COVID-19 crisis has provided many instances of effective leadership from sources other than national governments.For example, while the US and Chinese governments have used the pandemic to ratchet up bilateral tensions, myriad international networks of researchers, foundations, businesses and government agencies have been working together to develop treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, with little concern for nationality.Broader participation in global-security efforts will also increasingly dissolve the boundary between \u201cdomestic\u201d and \u201cinternational\u201d affairs and policy.Health, environment, energy, cybersecurity, and criminal justice have all traditionally been seen as domestic matters, with foreign-policy and security experts regarding defence, diplomacy and development as entirely separate realms involving relations between countries and international organisations.But this distinction will progressively crumble.These shifts will in turn create opportunities for a vastly more diverse range of people to sit at the table on global security issues.Despite some gradual changes in conventional military domains in recent years, far more women and people of colour occupy prominent positions in city governments, and in fields like health and environmental protection, including environmental justice.NEED FOR GLOBAL SECURITYThe final piece of the puzzle is how to provide global security. Traditional military security is ultimately focused on winning.A UN Security Council meeting held in January 2020, before the global pandemic AFP/SPENCER PLATTBut many global threats primarily call for greater resilience \u2013 that is, less winning than withstanding. As Sharon Burke of New America has argued, the goal is more to build security at home than to destroy enemies abroad.We certainly still want to \u201cwin,\u201d if winning means prevailing over a virus, or eradicating a terrorist cell or disinformation network.But the deep nature of global threats means they can be reduced, but almost never eliminated. Arming people with the means to recognise and avoid danger, survive trauma, and adapt to new circumstances is a better long-term strategy.Nearly twice as many Americans have now died of COVID-19 than died in the Vietnam War.But many national leaders in the US and elsewhere remain focused on great-power competition, and appear less concerned with the pandemic\u2019s mounting death toll than with distracting domestic publics by pointing fingers at other countries.And yet the lessons of this crisis will loom large in how we think about and provide for our security in the future.That will be particularly true for younger generations.New America\u2019s Alexandra Stark, for example, argues that COVID-19 is her generation\u2019s 9/11.Instead of the highly militarised anti-terrorism response that the US adopted in the wake of those attacks, she calls for a new grand strategy \u201cfundamentally oriented around human well-being,\u201d refocusing on human health, prosperity, and opportunity.That sounds like security to me.Download\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegramAnne-Marie Slaughter is CEO of New America."}}, {"url_id": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/europeans-global-wave-anti-racism-protests-12814236", "content": {"url_label": "Europeans join global wave of anti-racism protests", "text": "MADRID:\u00a0Calling for racial justice, protesters rallied across Europe on Sunday (Jun 7), joining a wave of demonstrations sparked by the death of African American George Floyd at the hands of US police.A video of the incident with Floyd pleading for his life in Minneapolis as a white police officer knelt on his neck has sparked angry protests worldwide, even as countries continue to discourage large gatherings to curb the coronavirus pandemic.Several thousand people massed outside the US embassy in Madrid, shouting \"I cannot breathe\", Floyd's last words, and demanding justice.\"Racism knows no borders,\" said Leinisa Seemdo, a 26-year-old Spanish translator from Cape Verde. \"In all the countries where I have lived, I have experienced discrimination because of the colour of my skin.\"Rome's Piazza del Popolo (\"People's Plaza\") fell silent for eight minutes -\u00a0roughly the time Floyd was pinned down by the policeman - as thousands of people took a knee in memory of Floyd, their fists in the air.People kneel as they gather calling for justice for George Floyd, who died on May 25 after being restrained by police in Minneapolis, USA, in Rome's Piazza del Popolo square.

The meeting was \"contentious\", the official added.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump has since appeared satisfied with deployments by the National Guard, the option recommended by the Pentagon and a more traditional tool for dealing with domestic crises. Pentagon leaders scrambled to call governors with requests to send Guard forces to Washington. Additional federal law enforcement were mobilised too.But also key for Trump appears to have been Esper's move to preposition \u2013 but not deploy \u2013 active duty soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division and other units in the Washington DC area in case they were needed. Those troops have since departed.\"Having active duty forces available but not in the city was enough for the president for the time,\" the official said.Trump's bid to militarise the US response to the protests has triggered a rare outpouring of condemnation from former US military officials, including Trump's first defence secretary, Jim Mattis, and retired four-star generals who normally try to steer clear of politics.Those comments reflect deep unease inside and outside the Pentagon with Trump's willingness to inject the US\u00a0military into a domestic race relations crisis following the killing of Floyd, 46, who died on May 25 after a Minneapolis policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.Floyd's death has led to a wave of protests and national soul-searching over the country's legacy of violence and mistreatment of African Americans and other minorities.It has also led some Pentagon leaders of colour to issue unprecedented statements about their experiences dealing with issues of race in the US military.ESPER'S FUTURE?Esper publicly voiced his opposition on Wednesday to invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy active duty forces \u2013 remarks to reporters that did not go over well with either Trump or his top aides.The senior US official said Trump yelled at Esper after that news conference.As speculation swirled over whether the president might fire him, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said Trump \"remains confident in Secretary Esper\".\"Secretary Esper has been instrumental in securing our nation's streets and ensuring Americans have peace and confidence in the security of their places of business, places of worship\u00a0and their homes,\" McEnany said in a statement.Esper issued a memo on Tuesday reminding Defence Department personnel \"we commit to protecting the American people's right to freedom of speech and to peaceful assembly\".Milley issued a similar statement reminding troops of their oath to the US Constitution, which protects the right to peaceful protests.Those statements by Milley and Esper came after they took fierce criticism for using military planning terms like \"battlespace\" to describe American protest sites during a conference call with state governors that Trump hosted on Monday, a recording of which leaked.At the time, the Pentagon was concerned that Trump might deploy active duty troops if the governors did not sufficiently employ the National Guard, the official said.Esper and Milley have also faced criticism for accompanying Trump for a photo opportunity outside a church near the White House on Monday after police cleared the area by firing smoke grenades and chemical irritant \"pepper balls\" and charging into peaceful protesters."}}, {"url_id": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-us-china-sabotage-12813210", "content": {"url_label": "US senator says China trying to sabotage COVID-19 vaccine development", "text": "LONDON: The United States has evidence China is trying to slow down or sabotage the development of a COVID-19 vaccine by Western countries, Republican senator Rick Scott said on Sunday (Jun 7).\"We have got to get this vaccine done.

And, with casualties still mounting in many parts of the world, it is far from over.This will have serious long-term consequences for economic growth, public debt, employment, and human well-being.According to the Financial Times, global government debt has already reached its highest level in peacetime.Moreover, unemployment is skyrocketing in many countries: in the US, for example, one in four workers have filed for unemployment since mid-March, with new weekly claims far above historic highs.The International Monetary Fund expects the world economy to shrink by 3 per cent this year \u2013 a downgrade of 6.3 percentage points in just four months.All of this will exacerbate the climate and social crises that were already underway.Some countries have already used the COVID-19 crisis as an excuse to weaken environmental protections and enforcement.And frustrations over social ills like rising inequality \u2013 US billionaires\u2019 combined wealth has increased during the crisis \u2013 are intensifying.US President Donald Trump is eager to kickstart the economy, including in hard hit states like New York.\u00a0(Photo: AFP/Angela Weiss)Left unaddressed, these crises, together with COVID-19, will deepen and leave the world even less sustainable, less equal, and more fragile.A WILL DOES EXISTIncremental measures and ad hoc fixes will not suffice to prevent this scenario. We must build entirely new foundations for our economic and social systems.The level of cooperation and ambition this implies is unprecedented. But it is not some impossible dream. In fact, one silver lining of the pandemic is that it has shown how quickly we can make radical changes to our lifestyles.Almost instantly, the crisis forced businesses and individuals to abandon practices long claimed to be essential, from frequent air travel to working in an office.Likewise, populations have overwhelmingly shown a willingness to make sacrifices for the sake of health-care and other essential workers and vulnerable populations, such as the elderly.And many companies have stepped up to support their workers, customers\u00a0and local communities, in a shift toward the kind of stakeholder capitalism to which they had previously paid lip service.Clearly, the will to build a better society does exist. We must use it to secure the Great Reset that we so badly need.That will require stronger and more effective governments, though this does not imply an ideological push for bigger ones. And it will demand private-sector engagement every step of the way.REFORMS NEEDEDThe Great Reset agenda would have three main components. The first would steer the market toward fairer outcomes.To this end, governments should improve coordination - for example, in tax, regulatory, and fiscal policy - upgrade trade arrangements, and create the conditions for a \u201cstakeholder economy.\u201dAt a time of diminishing tax bases and soaring public debt, governments have a powerful incentive to pursue such action.Moreover, governments should implement long-overdue reforms that promote more equitable outcomes.Depending on the country, these may include changes to wealth taxes, the withdrawal of fossil-fuel subsidies, and new rules governing intellectual property, trade, and competition.The second component of a Great Reset agenda would ensure that investments advance shared goals, such as equality and sustainability.Here, the large-scale spending programs that many governments are implementing represent a major opportunity for progress. The European Commission, for one, has unveiled plans for a \u20ac750 billion (US$838 billion) recovery fund.The US, China, and Japan also have ambitious economic-stimulus plans.Rather than using these funds, as well as investments from private entities and pension funds, to fill cracks in the old system, we should use them to create a new one that is more resilient, equitable, and sustainable in the long run.China's economy tanked in the first three months of the year. (File photo: AFP/STR)This means, for example, building \u201cgreen\u201d urban infrastructure and creating incentives for industries to improve their track record on environmental, social, and governance metrics.The third and final priority of a Great Reset agenda is to harness the innovations of the Fourth Industrial Revolution to support the public good, especially by addressing health and social challenges.During the COVID-19 crisis, companies, universities, and others have joined forces to develop diagnostics, therapeutics, and possible vaccines; establish testing centres; create mechanisms for tracing infections; and deliver telemedicine. Imagine what could be possible if similar concerted efforts were made in every sector.The COVID-19 crisis is affecting every facet of people\u2019s lives in every corner of the world. But tragedy need not be its only legacy.On the contrary, the pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine, and reset our world to create a healthier, more equitable, and more prosperous future.Download\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegramKlaus Schwab is Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum."}}, {"url_id": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/coronavirus-covid-19-sweden-economy-lockdown-12812802", "content": {"url_label": "Sweden didn't lock down, but economy to plunge anyway", "text": "STOCKHOLM: Unlike most countries, Sweden never locked down during the coronavirus pandemic, largely keeping businesses operating, but the economy appears to be taking a hard hit nonetheless.Under the Scandinavian country's controversial approach to the virus, cafes, bars, restaurants and most businesses remained open, as did schools for under-16s, with people urged to follow social distancing and hygiene guidelines.Whatever hope there may have been that this policy would soften the economic blow now seems dashed.\"As in most of the world, there will be a record decline for the Swedish economy in Q2,\" SEB bank economist Olle Holmgren said.\"A LONG TIME\"A rebound was likely in the latter part of the year, but \"we expect it to take a long time before the situation normalises,\" he told AFP.To be fair, Swedish officials insist their strategy was always aimed at public health, and never specifically at saving the economy.The idea was to make sure hospitals could keep pace with the outbreak and protect the elderly and at-risk groups.Sweden has succeeded at the former, but admitted failure at the latter, with more than three-quarters of virus deaths occurring among nursing home residents and those receiving care at home.\"When we have decided what measures to take to stop the virus from spreading, we have not had any economic considerations. We have followed the advice of our (public health) experts on this issue,\" Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson told reporters in late May.Still, authorities acknowledge that keeping businesses open was also part of a broader public health consideration, as high unemployment and a weak economy typically lead to poorer public health.Sweden, a country of 10.3 million, had reported 4,639 COVID-19 deaths as of Friday.That gives it one of the world's highest virus mortality rates, with 459.3 deaths per million inhabitants - four times more than neighbouring Denmark and 10 times more than Norway, which both imposed stricter confinement measures.At first Sweden's export-heavy economy seemed to be doing okay, with GDP actually growing by 0.1 per cent in the first quarter.But now the country is expected to follow the same path as most of Europe, with its economy shrinking for the full-year 2020 and unemployment soaring.GDP DOWN, UNEMPLOYMENT UPIn April, the government predicted GDP would contract by four percent in 2020, compared to its January forecast of 1.1 per cent growth.While the European Commission has forecast a Swedish contraction of 6.1 per cent (compared to -6.5 per cent for Germany and -7.7 per cent for the eurozone), the outlook presented by the Swedish central bank is even more dire - it anticipates a GDP decline of up to 10 per cent.Some economists see Swedish growth rebounding as early as the second half of 2020, but the finance minister has warned things could get worse before they get better.Before the crisis, Sweden's labour market was in good shape, with strong job creation and a declining unemployment rate.Now, the government expects a jobless rate of nine percent for 2020 and 2021, compared to 6.8 per cent in 2019.It sees growth of 3.5 per cent in 2021.EXPORT-BASED ECONOMYSweden's sharp downturn is largely explained by its dependence on exports, which account for around 50 per cent of GDP.\"70 percent of Swedish exports go to the EU. Shutdowns in Germany, the UK and so on are expected to hit Swedish exports considerably,\" the government said.In March, some of the country's biggest companies, such as automaker Volvo Cars and truckmaker Scania, halted production in Sweden.This was not because of local restrictions, but because of problems with supply chains in Europe and the rest of the world. Their activities have since resumed.Meanwhile, consumption plunged by 24.8 percent between March 11 and April 5, according to a study conducted by four University of Copenhagen economists.\"Sweden is paying the same price (as Denmark) for the coronavirus pandemic. The explanation is that when you are in a galloping crisis, consumers pull the emergency brake, whether restaurants are closed or not,\" Niels Johannesen, one of the four economists, told Swedish daily Helsingborgs Dagblad.The government in mid-March announced measures worth nearly US$32 billion to help businesses.Since then, more money has been allocated and new measures have been added, including a reduction of employers' contributions.\"Given the state of government finances there is room for more expansionary fiscal policy ahead,\" Olle Holmgren promised.Download\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegram"}}, {"url_id": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/uk-support-for-johnson-s-conservatives-falls-as-covid-19-deaths-12812678", "content": {"url_label": "UK support for Johnson's Conservatives falls as COVID-19 deaths rise", "text": "LONDON: Three opinion polls released in Britain on Saturday (Jun 6) showed support falling for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party, as public confidence in the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic declines.However, the figures are unlikely to be an immediate concern for Johnson, who does not need to hold an election until 2024 after winning a comfortable parliamentary majority in December.The sharpest swing came in a poll conducted by Survation on Jun\u00a03, which had support for the Conservatives falling to 41 per cent from 45 per cent in the previous poll, conducted in the period May 22-26.

You may have also heard of the king cobra slithering towards Marsiling MRT and the herd of boars scavenging for food in Pasir Ris.Around the world, there have been stories about sheep cavorting in children\u2019s playgrounds in Wales, sika deer taking to the streets near Japan\u2019s Nara Park and kangaroos bounding down the streets of Adelaide.Could an outcome of this pandemic be the inadvertent rewilding of our world?A WELCOME DISTRACTIONThis scenario should be welcome news for a conservationist like me, whose work aims to restore natural environments and biodiversity.The truth, however, is probably simpler. While some wildlife could be emboldened by our absence, in most cases, these animals are searching for food.With disruption in public activity, usual sources of food for urbanised wildlife may suddenly become less available. Naturally, they start roaming a larger territory in search of food, probably helped by reduced human traffic and city noise.Such stories are a welcome distraction at this time, but they are not unique to a world in pandemic. The wildlife we notice now is less of a resurgence, than the realisation that we live in a shared space.Wild boars spotted around the Punggol reservoir area. (Photo: Mr Koh)In Singapore, we share our urban environment with local macaques, reptiles, birds and other wildlife. As with every shared living environment, conflict may sometimes seem inevitable \u2013 just ask the people who we\u2019ve been cooped up with at home.A typical reaction to the presence of wildlife in our living environment is \u201cNot in my backyard!\u201d Wildlife encounters have been met with hostility.In Singapore, snakes have been beaten to death simply for being in a garden. Elsewhere, elephants have been poisoned for venturing into plantations, raiding and trampling crops.But while we discuss the phenomena of returning wildlife, we risk ignoring a larger irony. Wildlife in urban environments may be a passing curiosity, but human encroachment on wildlife habitat is the very reason we are in lockdown battling the COVID-19 pandemic.There is considerable speculation about the origins of COVID-19 but scientists are certain it is a zoonotic disease, caused by a human being coming into contact with an animal, whether a bat or another animal that carried the coronavirus.LINK TO ZOONOTIC DISEASESCloser and more frequent contact with wildlife increases the spillover of pathogens from wildlife to humans.Previous pandemics have started in similar ways: Whether due to wild meat consumption (ebola); direct interaction with live wildlife; intermediate hosts such as civets (SARS), or domestic animals such as poultry (avian influenza).With its suspected origins in a wildlife market, COVID-19 is no exception.Tropical forests are home to millions of species including microbes and host animals. When intact, they act as a buffer protecting us from zoonotic\u00a0diseases.When these forests are destroyed, this natural buffer disappears. It is no surprise then that a\u00a0third of emerging infectious diseases are linked to deforestation.In spite of the knowledge we have about the impacts of deforestation, 16 million hectares of forest are cut down annually with no sign of a slowdown.Charred trunks are seen on a tract of Amazon jungle, that was recently burned by loggers and farmers, in Porto Velho, Brazil Aug\u00a023, 2019.\u00a0(Photo: REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino)From Southeast Asia to Brazil, we are clearing land to feed our demand for timber, soy, palm oil, beef and rubber. Likewise in Singapore and many growing cities, we clear land to make way for roads and buildings.Put bluntly, our staggering assault on nature may have created an infectious disease breeding ground over which we have no control.ROLE OF WILDLIFE TRADEPandemic risk is linked not just to habitat loss, but also to the exploitation of wildlife for trade and consumption.How exactly COVID-19 was transmitted remains uncertain. What\u2019s certain though, is that wildlife trade brings together animals (dead or alive) of varying species and sources into close proximity, especially in wildlife markets.Weak to no enforcement of laws in these markets, coupled with the absence of any veterinary controls, increase the risk of pathogens being transmitted to humans.The illegal wildlife trade affects more than 7,000 animal and plant species worldwide. As a global transhipment hub, Singapore has inadvertently facilitated the illegal trade of wildlife.Over 2019, Singapore authorities seized an unprecedented amount of pangolin scales and elephant ivory, worth more than S$170 million in total. A few of the seizures that year were among the largest the world has seen.Allowing illegal wildlife trade to continue sets up a lose-lose situation for us: The loss of biodiversity, and increased transmission risk of new viruses anywhere along illegal trade routes.A CHANCE TO BUILD SOMETHING BETTERMany are asking how life will look like after the pandemic. Our relationship with nature has shaped the situation we currently find ourselves in. We cannot return to normal, when normal led us to this.Office workers wearing face masks take their lunch break at the central business district amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Singapore June 2, 2020.  REUTERS/Edgar SuThere are three things that we must do differently to ensure this does not happen again.First, we must take steps to protect intact ecosystems and restore degraded forests globally. Only with strong legislation and effective enforcement can we protect our remaining natural spaces.Striking a balance between development needs and protecting nature has never been an easy choice in Singapore.But our experience with this pandemic must teach us that nature is intrinsic to our survival and economic welfare and must be a cornerstone for any development planning.In Singapore and beyond, we need to demand for the sustainable production of commodities like palm oil, rubber, soy, pulp and paper. This ensures the products we use are deforestation-free and not made at the expense of the natural environment.Second, where poaching and consumption of wildlife still thrive, we must crack down on illegal trade and close unregulated markets.Recognising the origin of COVID-19, China declared\u00a0on Feb 24 a comprehensive ban on wildlife trade and the consumption of wild animals.In Singapore, we applaud the recent changes to the now renamed Wildlife Act, which strengthens protection of local wildlife by addressing threats such as the poaching and feeding of wildlife.This must come together with a move to shut down transnational illegal trade via Singapore\u2019s ports and airport.A view of public housing\u00a0blocks, with solar panels affixed to the roof of some blocks, in Singapore on Jun\u00a027, 2019. (File photo: Reuters/Kevin Lam)Third, we need to acknowledge that preserving nature is key to economic recovery post-pandemic.According to the WEF\u2019s New Nature Economy Report released in January, more than half of the world\u2019s GDP is moderately or highly dependent on nature. For instance, the global US$2.5 trillion agriculture sector is dependent on pollination, water quality and a stable climate.COVID-19 has brought carbon-intensive industries to a grinding halt \u2013 we can make use of this momentum by shifting investments to and creating new jobs in sustainable businesses.Here in Southeast Asia, the shift has already begun. Clean energy industries in this region could create up to 2.2 million jobs by 2030.Our health is intricately linked to the health of all life on Earth. As we rebuild our economy after COVID-19, we need to acknowledge the damage we have done and work on repairing our relationship with nature.This is the only way we can better protect ourselves and loved ones from future health and climate crises.Elizabeth Clarke is Conservation Director of the World Wide Fund for Nature Singapore."}}, {"url_id": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/dozens-wounded-in-clashes-as-hundreds-of-protesters-flood-beirut-12812262", "content": {"url_label": "Dozens wounded in clashes as hundreds of protesters flood Beirut", "text": "BEIRUT:\u00a0Protesters poured into the streets of the Lebanese capital Saturday (Jun 6) to decry the collapse of the economy, as clashes erupted between supporters and opponents of the Iran-backed Shiite group Hezbollah.Hundreds filled the streets in and around the protest hub of Martyrs Square in the centre of Beirut, with skirmishes also between protesters and security forces, who fired tear gas.Forty-eight were wounded in the violence, 11 of whom were hospitalised, while the rest were treated at the scene, the Lebanese Red Cross said.It was the first major anti-government rally attracting demonstrators from across the country since authorities relaxed a lockdown imposed in mid-March to fight the spread of the coronavirus.\"We came on the streets to demand our rights, call for medical care, education, jobs and the basic rights that human beings need to stay alive,\" said 21-year-old student Christina.Many protesters wore face-masks as part of hygiene measures imposed to fight the pandemic, which has severely exacerbated an economic crisis, the worst since the debt burdened country's 1975-1990 civil war.But Saturday's protest turned violent as supporters of Hezbollah clashed with some demonstrators who were demanding that the group disarm.Hezbollah is the only group to have kept its weapons since the end of the Lebanese civil war, deeply dividing Lebanon along political lines.\"No to Hezbollah, no to its weapons,\" said a sign held up by Sana, a female protester from Nabatiyeh, a city in southern Lebanese, a Hezbollah stronghold.\"Weapons should be only in the hands of the army,\" said the 57-year-old.Supporters and opponents of Hebzollah threw stones at each other prompting the army to intervene by forming a human chain to separate them, an AFP photographer said.Supporters of Hezbollah, which is also represented in the government and parliament, chanted: \"Shiite, Shiite.\"\"ELIMINATE CORRUPTION\"Security forces fired tear gas near a street leading into the parliament building behind Martyrs Square, after some demonstrators pelted them with stones and ransacked shops in the area.Some protesters set fire to garbage bins as anti-riot police advanced towards them.Lebanon has been rocked by a series of political crises in recent years, before an economic crunch helped trigger unprecedented cross-sectarian mass protests in October.The demonstrations forced the government to resign and a new one headed by Prime Minister Hassan Diab was approved by parliament in February, tasked with launching reforms and combatting corruption.But many Lebanese say the new administration has failed to find solutions to the country's manifold problems, including a grinding recession and spiralling inflation.The local currency has lost more than half of its value on the black market in recent months, falling from the official rate of 1,507 to more than 4,000 pounds to the dollar. Banks have gradually stopped all dollar withdrawals.A sign held aloft by protesters on Saturday called for \"a government that eliminates corruption, not one that protects corruption\".More than 35 percent of Lebanese are unemployed, while poverty has soared to engulf more than 45 percent of the population, according to official estimates.Lebanon is also one of the world's most indebted countries with a debt equivalent to more than 170 percent of its GDP.

While pepper spray is chemically distinct from tear gas, it produces similar effects: burning and watering of the eyes and skin.Police have also fired pepper balls, small projectiles containing chemical irritants. Such projectiles can contain PAVA spray, an irritant similar to pepper spray, as well as CS gas. The balls can be shot from launchers or modified paintball guns.RUBBER, PLASTIC BULLETS:Protesters have been hit by a variety of rubber, plastic, and \u201csponger\u201d bullets. Reuters journalists in Minneapolis were shot by police with 40mm hard plastic projectiles during a protest in May.Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said the city\u2019s police department will minimise the use of rubber projectiles during peaceful protests going forward.FILE PHOTO: The rubber bullet shells from a 40mm less-lethal gun lie on the ground after being launched at protesters rioting near the Target store on University Avenue after the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, in St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S. May 28, 2020.

I understand why people are deeply upset,\" the UK health minister said on Friday.\"But we are still facing a health crisis and coronavirus remains a real threat.\"Officials around the world have been trying to balance understanding at people's pent-up anger with warnings about the dangers of a disease that has officially claimed nearly 400,000 lives globally.Yet tens of thousands of Australians defied Prime Minister Scott Morrison's call to \"find a better way\", tens of thousands marched in France, and thousands more in Britain ignored the health minister's warning.And in Tunis, hundreds chanted: \"We want justice!
