Instead, they siphoned off browsing history and data that provided credentials for access to internal business tools.Based on the number of downloads, it was the most far-reaching malicious Chrome store campaign to date, according to Awake co-founder and chief scientist Gary Golomb.Google declined to discuss how the latest spyware compared with prior campaigns, the breadth of the damage, or why it did not detect and remove the bad extensions on its own despite past promises to supervise offerings more closely.It is unclear who was behind the effort to distribute the malware. Awake said the developers supplied fake contact information when they submitted the extensions to Google.\u201cAnything that gets you into somebody\u2019s browser or email or other sensitive areas would be a target for national espionage as well as organized crime,\u201d said former National Security Agency engineer Ben Johnson, who founded security companies Carbon Black and Obsidian Security.The extensions were designed to avoid detection by antivirus companies or security software that evaluates the reputations of web domains, Golomb said.If someone used the browser to surf the web on a home computer, it would connect to a series of websites and transmit information, the researchers found. Anyone using a corporate network, which would include security services, would not transmit the sensitive information or even reach the malicious versions of the websites.\u201cThis shows how attackers can use extremely simple methods to hide, in this case, thousands of malicious domains,\u201d Golomb said.All of the domains in question, more than 15,000 linked to each other in total, were purchased from a small registrar in Israel, Galcomm, known formally as CommuniGal Communication Ltd.Awake said Galcomm should have known what was happening.In an email exchange, Galcomm owner Moshe Fogel told Reuters that his company had done nothing wrong.\u201cGalcomm is not involved, and not in complicity with any malicious activity whatsoever,\u201d Fogel wrote. \u201cYou can say exactly the opposite, we cooperate with law enforcement and security bodies to prevent as much as we can.\u201dFogel said there was no record of the inquiries Golomb said he made in April and again in May to the company\u2019s email address for reporting abusive behavior, and he asked for a list of suspect domains. Reuters sent him that list three times without getting a substantive response.The Internet Corp for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees registrars, said it had received few complaints about Galcomm over the years, and none about malware.While deceptive extensions have been a problem for years, they are getting worse. They initially spewed unwanted advertisements, and now are more likely to install additional malicious programs or track where users are and what they are doing for government or commercial spies.Malicious developers have been using Google\u2019s Chrome Store as a conduit for a long time. After one in 10 submissions was deemed malicious, Google said in 2018 https://blog.chromium.org/2018/10/trustworthy-chrome-extensions-by-default.html it would improve security, in part by increasing human review.But in February, independent researcher Jamila Kaya and Cisco Systems\u2019 Duo Security uncovered https://duo.com/labs/research/crxcavator-malvertising-2020 a similar Chrome campaign that stole data from about 1.7 million users. Google joined the investigation and found 500 fraudulent extensions.\u201cWe do regular sweeps to find extensions using similar techniques, code and behaviors,\u201d Google's Westover said, in identical language to what Google gave out after Duo's report.(Reporting by Joseph Menn; Editing by Greg Mitchell and Leslie Adler)"}}, {"url_id": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/global-stocks-retreat-on-rising-second-wave-fears-12847424", "content": {"url_label": "Global stocks retreat on rising second wave fears", "text": "TOKYO/WASHINGTON: Asian stocks and Wall Street futures fell on Thursday as spiking coronavirus cases in some U.S. states and China crushed hopes of a quick global economic comeback from the pandemic.S&P 500 mini futures  fell 1.2per cent in early Asian trade while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  lost as much as 1per cent.Japan's Nikkei  lost 1.3per cent while in mainland China, bluechip CSI300 shares  shed 0.1per cent in early trade.On Wall Street, the S&P 500  lost 0.36per cent on Wednesday but tech-heavy Nasdaq  added 0.15per cent due to hopes of increased demand for various online services due to the epidemic.Several U.S. states including Oklahoma, where President Donald Trump plans a campaign rally on Saturday, reported a surge in new coronavirus infections.The daily count of infections also hit a new benchmark in California and Texas, while Florida and Arizona also recorded the second-highest daily increases.China's capital cancelled scores of flights, shut schools and blocked off some neighbourhoods as it ramped up efforts to contain a coronavirus outbreak that has fanned fears of wider contagion.\"It is a big shock to markets that China, which appears to have successfully quashed the disease, is seeing a second wave.

While overall mortality rates have fallen for those with a four-year degree, they have risen for less-educated Americans.Life expectancy at birth for all Americans fell between 2014 and 2017. That was the first three-year drop in life expectancy since the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 to 1919; with two epidemics now raging at once, life expectancy is set to fall again.INEQUALITY BRINGS PAIN, LONELINESS AND DISABILITYBehind these mortality figures are equally gloomy economic data. Real (inflation-adjusted) wages for US men without a college degree have fallen for 50 years.At the same time, college graduates\u2019 earnings premium over those without a degree has risen to an astonishing 80 per cent.With less-educated Americans becoming increasingly less likely to have jobs, the share of prime-age men in the labour force has trended downward for decades, as has the labour-force participation rate for women since 2000.Educated Americans are pulling away from the less-educated majority not only in terms of income, but also in health outcomes. Pain, loneliness, and disability have become more common among those without a degree.An applicant goes through paperwork at a Manhattan job fair in New York City. (File photo: AFP/Mario Tama)Such was the US on the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, the virus has newly exposed the pre-existing inequalities.PANDEMICS USUALLY BRING GREATER EQUALITYHistorically, pandemics have arguably brought greater equality.Most famously, the Black Death killed so many people in fourteenth-century Europe that it created a labour scarcity, which improved workers\u2019 bargaining position.Later, in the 19th century, cholera epidemics inspired the germ theory of disease, setting the stage for the modern increase in longevity, first in the rich countries, and then, after World War II, in the rest of the world.A great divergence in lifespans across the world gave way to a great convergence.A BREWING DIVERGENCE IN THE USBut the US has been experiencing a great divergence at home for two generations, and COVID-19 promises to widen the country\u2019s already vast inequalities in health and income.The effects of the virus are stratified by educational attainment, because those with more education are likelier to be able to continue working and earning from home.Unless they are among the highly educated workers in healthcare and other front-line sectors, they can sit back and watch the stock market propel the value of their retirement funds ever higher.By contrast, the two-thirds of workers who lack a four-year college degree are either nonessential, and thus risk losing their earnings, or essential, and thus at risk of infection. Whereas college graduates have largely been able to safeguard both their health and their wealth, less-educated workers must risk one or the other.FILE PHOTO: People who lost their jobs wait in line to file for unemployment following an outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at an Arkansas Workforce Center in Fort Smith, Arkansas, U.S. April 6, 2020. REUTERS/Nick OxfordFor this reason, the income and longevity gaps that the trend in deaths of despair has revealed are now widening further.THE DISPARITIES MAY BE RACIALWhile less-educated whites have borne the brunt of the first epidemic, African-Americans and Hispanics have been disproportionately killed by COVID-19. As a result, the previous convergence of white and black mortality rates has been derailed.There are many reasons for these racial disparities, including residential segregation, crowded living conditions, and commuting patterns.While these factors have been especially important in New York City, they have played less of a role in other places. In New Jersey, for example, neither African-Americans nor Hispanics have disproportionately higher COVID-19 mortality rates.America\u2019s costly healthcare system will continue to compound the pandemic\u2019s effects. Many among the tens of millions of Americans who lost their jobs this spring also lost their employer-provided health insurance, and many will not be able to secure alternative coverage.CAN THE POOR AFFORD HEALTHCARE IN A TIME OF COVID-19?While no one presenting with COVID-19 symptoms has been denied treatment, some of the uninsured may not have sought it.As of this writing, the virus\u2019s death toll in the US is at least 113,000, and more than 200,000 have been hospitalised, incurring potentially unpayable medical bills (even for many with insurance) that will ruin their credit for life.The US federal government has given pharmaceutical companies billions of public dollars to develop a vaccine and, thanks to lobbyists, did not attach conditions on pricing or impose public claims on patents.FURTHER CONSOLIDATION IN KEY BUSINESS SECTORSIn addition, the pandemic is fueling further industry consolidation by favouring already dominant e-commerce giants at the expense of struggling brick-and-mortar firms.People who lost their jobs wait in line to file for unemployment following an outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at an Arkansas Workforce Center in Fayetteville, Arkansas, on Apr\u00a06, 2020. (Photo: REUTERS/Nick Oxford)Labour\u2019s share of GDP \u2013 long thought to have been an immutable constant \u2013 has fallen in recent years, and market power in both product and labour markets may be one reason.If the unemployment rate remains high in the coming years, the terms of trade between labour and capital will be pushed even further toward the latter, inverting the Black Death analogy and justifying the stock market\u2019s optimism in the face of catastrophe.A LOSS OF WAY OF LIFEThat said, we do not believe that the post-COVID economy will provoke a spike in deaths of despair. The fundamental cause of that epidemic, our analysis suggests, was not economic fluctuations, but rather the long-term loss of a way of life among white working-class Americans.Notably, deaths of despair were rising before the 2008 global financial crisis, when US unemployment rose from 4.5 per cent to 10 per cent, and they continued to rise as unemployment gradually fell to 3.5 per cent in the days before the pandemic.If there once was a relationship between suicide and unemployment, it is no longer apparent in the US.Nonetheless, past episodes suggest that those entering the labour market in 2020 will have a lower earnings path throughout their working lives, possibly creating the despair that brings death from suicide, alcohol, or drug overdoses.In other words, the most likely post-COVID America will be the same as pre-COVID America, only with even more inequality and dysfunction.True, public anger over police violence or outrageously expensive health care could create a structural break.If that happens, we might see a better society. Or, we might not.

Louis Vuitton now offers complimentary delivery for its goods via men in suits. These measure, while creative, yield limited results.

(Photo:\u00a0REUTERS/Eric Gaillard)In May, news stories reported that a host of high-end brands, including Bulgari, Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co, had hiked the prices of some of their goods to varying degrees.When pressed to explain the move, their representatives attributed the rise to price harmonisation across various markets, exchange rate fluctuations and the escalating cost of raw materials.While these reasons may appear reasonable, some might argue even favourable, under ordinary circumstances, updated sales records clearly indicate the recent decision to increase retail prices by relatively larger margins is primarily aimed at combating the unprecedented detrimental effects of the ongoing pandemic.LVMH, the parent company of approximately 60 prestigious companies, registered a 17 per cent year-on-year drop in revenue this first quarter.Rival conglomerate Kering SA, whose portfolio includes Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta and Gucci, also saw its first-quarter sales plummet by around 15 per cent. Likewise, Burberry recently announced that its annual pre-tax profit fell by 62 per cent year-on-year.LUXURY GOODS ARE IN A TOUGH SPOTA lot has already been said about the hit that the global economy has taken \u2013 and is continuing to take \u2013 on account of COVID-19. According to the International Monetary Fund, world GDP will fall by 3 per cent in 2020.At zero per cent, Asia\u2019s growth is expected to completely stall. Singapore, owing to its open economy model, is bound to shrink by 5.8 per cent.Unemployment figures are rising steeply, too, with young adults bearing the brunt of the economic setback.More than one in six young people have stopped working since the pandemic began, whereas those who retain jobs have seen their working hours cut by 23 per cent, according to the International Labour Organisation.While the adverse effects of the crisis are felt far and wide, the luxury goods segment is in a particularly tough spot.Last year, another Bain study found that Asia delivered the vast majority of the global luxury market growth, with young, middle class shoppers forming the steady consumer base. Now the industry\u2019s dual engines of growth \u2013 geographic as well as demographic \u2013 have come to a halt.A man passes by the closed Tiffany & Co store on Wall St. in the financial district of New York City, U.S., March 17, 2020. (Photo: REUTERS/Lucas Jackson)In economics textbooks, luxury goods are often classified as products with high income elasticity of demand. As individuals earn more, they purchase proportionately more luxury goods. Conversely, when income falls, the demand drops more than proportionately.Yet, most items of personal luxury can also be said to be examples of Veblen goods, which have shown to defy the basic law of demand. When their price increases, so does their demand, as consumers see the surcharge as a signal of added prestige.In a non-crisis, stable economy, this creates a perverse incentive. However, the model breaks down in the event of a pandemic, where skyrocketing prices of luxury goods are matched by nosediving incomes.Established brands do not lose their special status overnight, but they do risk distancing a loyal customer base in the medium to long run if they keep this up.KEEPING THE MARKET GOINGSo what should these premier fashion houses do?First, diversification. If there was ever a time for luxury powerhouses to expand their product- and price-range, it is now.Giving consumers a larger selection of products with incremental differentiating features at corresponding price points can be a lifesaver. Apart from charming new consumers, such a strategy could also satiate the appetite of variety-seeking buyers.In this, the example of Louis Vuitton stands out. At the time of its inception in 1854, the company focussed solely on manufacturing lightweight luggage trunks.But, more than a century and a half later, the French fashion giant\u2019s Singapore website now sells luxury versions of just about everything, from handbags and time pieces, to dumbbells and earphones.\\A man wearing a protective face mask walks past a closed Louis Vuitton shop on the Croisette in Cannes during a lockdown. (Photo: REUTERS/Eric Gaillard)Although studies have pointed out that most other luxury companies shy away from broadening their offerings and working on brand extensions through collaborations due to the ingrained fear of dilution, the pandemic is an inflection point for brands to rethink the notions of exclusivity and market dominance.Second, discounts. Among other things, the health crisis has managed to push a few luxury brands to take the ordinarily unthinkable plunge into the almost sinful world of slashed prices.In April, Bloomberg reported that Neiman Marcus was offering a 50 per cent discount on Tom Ford glasses, while Saks Fifth Avenue was selling a Derek Lam striped shirtdress at 40 per cent off the regular price.In Singapore, luxury cosmetics company Clarins has been offering discounts and welcome gifts for first-time buyers.Although the concept of accessible luxury has been picking up some pace in recent years, many big brands have typically refrained from significant price cuts, worrying that the move could lead to some form of status erosion.This new approach stands in sharp contrast to brands\u2019 recently defunct practice of setting their unsold stock of goods on fire to preserve product scarcity, and, indirectly, maintain a distinct reputation.Another often-cited reason behind the reluctance to put luxury goods on sale is to avoid upsetting consumers who already paid the full price.For the industry to salvage at least some production cost in the immediate future, and create a legion of new consumers in the distant future, destigmatising sensible discounts is recommended.Third, digital engagement. Much has been said about making judicious use of the Internet during the pandemic in making the customer\u2019s online purchase experience hassle-free.However, given that the star treatment experience physical outlets offer plays a central role for luxury brands, these digital initiatives should broaden beyond creating an aesthetically pleasing website and using social media platforms to promote the latest collections, to foster engagement with interested buyers.As social distancing measures (including a cap on the size of gatherings) are here to stay, firms must leverage on rapidly developing artificial intelligence solutions to pique their buyers\u2019 interests.Dior\u2019s initiative to create a virtual version of its Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es store in Paris is a case in point. Launched earlier this year, this website allows users around the world to explore the company\u2019s signature boutique and directly place an order for the products on display.A Dior store in Paris, France, January 27, 2020. (Photo: REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes)Virtual consultations, live chats and livestreamed product launch events are other means for brands to partially replicate the in-store experience for shoppers. The expression may come across as hackneyed, but there really is no substitute for prompt and continuous innovation.There is no denying that neither individually nor collectively will these actions be sufficient to perfectly insulate Singapore\u2019s luxury goods industry from the hardships brought upon by COVID-19.While the purchase decisions of local residents will be severely affected by the recession and gradual recovery, travel restrictions will keep the number of cash-rich tourists to a bare minimum.Even though this does not bode well for the market, the strategies mentioned above could be thought of as additional measures to cushion some of the blows high-end retailers will suffer until the health crisis is brought to heel.Download\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegramPritish Bhattacharya is Research Officer in the Regional Economic Studies Programme at the ISEAS \u2013 Yusof Ishak Institute."}}, {"url_id": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/unemployment-payments-backlog-draws-hundreds-to-kentucky-s-capital-12846548", "content": {"url_label": "Unemployment payments backlog draws hundreds to Kentucky's capital", "text": "FRANKFORT, Ky.: Hundreds of people who lost jobs during the coronavirus crisis but have been unable to get their unemployment insurance checks converged at the Kentucky Capitol in Frankfort early Wednesday to seek in-person help.Margaret Wells worked in retail in Louisville and has been unemployed since April.

The reports followed on the heels of data on Tuesday showing a record surge in retail sales in May.

The economy slipped into recession in February.\"Housing is a leading economic indicator and it is pointing the way forward but there is a limit to growth when the economy has to drag along the millions and millions of unemployed workers displaced in this pandemic recession who won't be seeing paychecks anytime soon,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.Housing starts rose 4.3 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 974,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said. The increase recouped only a fraction of the more than 40 per cent cumulative decline in homebuilding in March and April. Starts dropped 23.2 per cent on a year-on-year basis in May.The rise in starts last month was tempered by a 0.1 per cent gain in single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, to a rate of 675,000 units. Steep decreases in homebuilding the Midwest and populous South offset robust increases in the West and Northeast.Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment jumped 15.0 per cent to a pace of 299,000 units.With starts still in a deep rut, economists expect a sharp decline in homebuilding in the second quarter, in line with projections for the steepest contraction in gross domestic product since the Great Depression.The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP falling at 45.5 per cent rate in the second quarter. The economy shrank at a 5 per cent pace in the January-March quarter, the deepest contraction since the 2007-2009 Great Recession.\"The drop in housing construction in the second-quarter GDP report is likely to be jaw-dropping,\" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.Stocks on Wall Street were lower in volatile trading as a record rise in coronavirus cases in six states hurt sentiment after a three-day rally.

But the recovery in benchmark oil prices to around US$40 a barrel makes some shale output profitable again, even though that level is unlikely to spur additional new drilling activity. Larger producers are re-opening the taps in low-cost plays in Texas, but also in expensive shale basins in North Dakota and Oklahoma.\"With prices where they are now, if they stay above US$30, I wouldn't expect any significant curtailments from us in Q3 or beyond,\" Devon Energy Corp Chief Executive David Hager said at a J.P. Morgan energy conference on Tuesday.Fracking activity tracker Primary Vision estimates as much as 500,000 bpd of production will return to the market by month-end, while Rystad Energy estimates 400,000 bpd could be added to the market between June and August.\"Some of the bigger guys that we work with are starting to turn everything back on,\" said Joshua Wade, an oil marketer in Oklahoma, who works with producers to transport barrels and buys lease volumes.(GRAPHIC - Shale producers pump barrels back into oil market: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/ygdpzqxgnvw/usper cent20production.PNG)Producers are also pumping oil out of storage, which filled when demand plummeted as billions of people worldwide stopped traveling due to lockdowns to slow the spread of coronavirus.Weekly oil data shows U.S. output at about 10.5 million bpd, its lowest since March 2018 and off the all-time monthly record of about 12.9 million bpd reached in November, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.Much of the declines came from shale wells that were choked back but not shut-in completely, several shale company executives said.\"We were able to shut in thousands of wells with really minimal time and effort. And we can bring those back on with really minimal time and effort, too,\" EOG Resources Inc Chief Operating Officer Lloyd Helms said at a Tuesday industry conference.Diamondback Energy Inc focused on curtailing volumes rather than fully shutting wells, Adam Lawlis, vice president of investor relations, said in a statement.About 8,000 bpd of the 10,000 bpd of oil that shale producer Devon curtailed came from choking back wells or slightly delaying wells.\"We're in the process of bringing all of that back on,\" Hager said.Prices in cash markets reflect anticipated new supply. Crude oil for July delivery out of Midland, Texas, the heart of the Permian basin, sank to a discount to benchmark futures while Bakken prices fell to their weakest levels in a month last week.As of Friday in North Dakota, where the Bakken is primarily located, about 60,000 bpd of production had come back online from mid-May, leaving 450,000 still shut, according to the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources.Companies including private-equity backed Lime Rock Resources have turned wells in the Bakken back on while Continental Resources told pumpers to be ready to ramp up activity by July 1, sources familiar with the matter said.Neither company responded to requests for comment.ConocoPhillips is thinking of bringing back curtailed volumes over the next few months after shutting in a third of its production, CEO Ryan Lance told research firm IHS Markit. The company will also restore 100,000 bpd in shut-ins in Alaska by July.The increase in production may not last, analysts said. North American oil companies have slashed spending by 35per cent, and U.S. rig counts have dropped to a record low. Since shale well output declines by more than 60per cent after the first year, the reduced spend on drilling will weigh on shale production over the long term, sources at shale companies said.Producers also cautioned that rolling coronavirus outbreaks currently occurring in the United States may continue to restrict fuel demand.One Bakken producer said they are operating at just 15per cent of usual output, and oil prices would need to hit US$43 a barrel for output to fully resume.\"Oil going to US$40 for a fleeting moment isn't going to be enough for some of our stronger operators to say, 'Okay, I'm going to just turn the turn the tap on.'

A cryptocurrency investment veteran in his early 40s, Madison said he scored a return of 174per cent by investing \"a few hundred bucks\" in Hertz's stock over the past few weeks.Hertz itself has noticed.

Hertz's stock is  up 388per cent from the low it hit after it filed for bankruptcy. It remains among the most popular stocks traded on Robinhood.A few investors say they will hold onto their Hertz stock, despite the risk of being wiped out. Sherrie Hardy, a 33-year-old airport security worker in Muskegon, Michigan, said she used her and her fianc\u00e9e's stimulus checks to invest in Hertz and have no plans to sell.\"I invested not only in a sense of capitalizing, but actually want to be a supporter of Hertz.

While Mr Tan assured staff that \u201cthis will be the last organisation-wide lay-off this year\u201d, it is unclear whether the firm\u2019s announced restructuring to eliminate non-core projects and consolidate functions will lead to more cuts in specific business units down the road.BREWING CONCERNSThe writing was on the wall when co-founder Tan Hooi Ling warned last month of a \u201clong winter\u201d. Grab also announced a limit to its performance-based commission rebate to 18,000 drivers and had even asked employees to go on voluntary no-pay leave.It was also barely a week ago that Grab Singapore head Yee Wee Tang told CNA the growth in food deliveries was insufficient to cover the sharp decline in its ride-hailing business, after coming under fire for high commission fees charged to eateries.To be fair, Grab\u2019s latest round of retrenchments have been rather muted, when you compare their 5 per cent layoff rate to Uber\u2019s letting go of 14 per cent of its global workforce last month and Deliveroo\u2019s 25 per cent cut to\u00a0 its Singapore staff.If anything, this latest announcement provides insight into the overall health of the private car-sharing sector and its adjacent verticals including food delivery, suggesting this sector is on shaky ground.People wait for the start of Grab's fifth anniversary news conference in Singapore June 6, 2017. (File photo: REUTERS/Edgar Su)Prolonged lockdowns around the world and people\u2019s subsequent hesitation of being out and about even after restrictions are lifted, combined with the likely continuation of work-from-home arrangements for the foreseeable future have delivered a double whammy to this class of platform titans and strained their balance sheets.The disrupters have been disrupted by the ultimate agent of havoc: The coronavirus.GRAB HAS CHANGED OUR LIVES - MOSTLY FOR THE BETTERWhen news of the layoffs broke yesterday, many were concerned loved ones working in the ride-hailing giant might have been impacted and their livelihoods endangered.But the news astonished more, because Grab has come to be an intractable part of Singapore\u2019s social and economic fabric, changing the way we pay, roam and eat.Laying aside controversy over the high commission fees, few eateries can imagine making the wholesale migration to e-commerce and food deliveries, much less reaching this broad a customer base.Grab might have been an expensive platform and marketing firm to get on, but in the time of COVID-19, F&B microenterprises might prefer at least having this option.The private car-sharing app has also reshaped the taxi industry for the better. Long gone are the days where it took forever and a minute more to find a cab.For cab drivers, having to drive around looking for passengers to no avail must seem like a distant dream (at least before the coronavirus struck).For better or worse, Grab has inextricably fused itself into the daily lives of Singapore residents. They say a brand has made it when people start using it as a \u201cverb\u201d in their daily lexicon and don\u2019t we know it.In this\u00a0dog-eat-dog world of commerce, Grab has risen above its competitors in Southeast Asia.

(Photo: Grab)Even Go-Jek\u2019s growth has primarily been concentrated in Indonesia, the largest addressable market size in Southeast Asia.CAPITALISM SHAKEN TO ITS COREWhile Grab has stoked debate and raised eyebrows in the course of its unruly journey these past years, few, if any, would want to see Grab continue losing revenues and laying off people.In the good old days, we consumers enjoyed the perks of deep discounts on rides and food deliveries. If we were offered a S$5 off coupon, we would snap it up.Even when we knew deep down within this business model that doled out ridiculously priced bargains was in no way sustainable, we applauded Grab for being an innovative, revolutionary firm that transformed the transport landscape and more.When the Singapore Government provided the legislative space recognising Grab\u2019s value, with a new point-to-point transport bill implicitly acknowledging the criticality of this new business model in 2019, it surely did so after a hard-nosed calculation that Grab was on the whole beneficial for the Singapore economy and was contributing to economic growth.The firm was providing jobs in a burgeoning digital technology sector, including aiding people to get back on their feet with gigs as drivers or deliverers when their going got tough.But now when the cards are down, we worry that these layoffs augur a rougher ride ahead. Perhaps we have been in as much denial as Softbank. We wanted to believe companies like Grab would grow so big, they would eventually turn profitable on their own.One thing is for certain: COVID-19 has shaken capitalism to its core.In the business world, there is growing talk of the \u201cEconomics of Mutuality\u201d, championed by Mars Incorporated Chief Economist\u00a0Bruno Roche, which urges businesses to consider a model that \u201coffers maximum freedom to realise optimal, sustainable, long-term success for business,\u00a0people,\u00a0the communities they operate in and our planet\u201d.Firms are encouraged to focus on delivering value to people, considering the interests of stakeholders across the value chain and long-term sustainability.A man walks past a Grab office in Singapore. (Photo: Reuters/Edgar Su)\u201cThe signs from these past months are encouraging and show that businesses have begun to rethink risks and reimagine their role and purpose in society,\u201d National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre chief Melissa Kwee said in a CNA commentary.Mr Tan\u2019s address to Grabbers on Tuesday suggest he knows this too. \u201cOur commitment to our customers in Southeast Asia is unwavering. We are deeply rooted here and we continue to stay true to our mission of driving Southeast Asia forward,\u201d he said.Grab may not be out of the woods yet. But the hope is that Grab can turn things around, especially if demand in ride-hailing picks up as Singapore shifts into Phase 2 of its reopening come Friday.Download\u00a0our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegramJonathan Chang is an entrepreneur, investor, educator, and global speaker."}}, {"url_id": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/hilton-2100-corporate-jobs-globally-12842054", "content": {"url_label": "Hilton to cut 2,100 corporate jobs globally", "text": "VIRGINIA: Hotel chain Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc said on Tuesday (Jun 16) it would cut about 22 per cent of its corporate workforce, or 2,100 jobs, in response to the coronavirus outbreak that has ravaged the global travel industry.The company is also extending previously announced furloughs, reduced hours, and corporate pay cuts for up to an additional three months.\"Never in Hilton's 101-year history has our industry faced a global crisis that brings travel to a virtual standstill,\" Chief Executive Officer Christopher Nassetta said in a statement.Hilton's corporate staff consisted of about 9,600 workers globally, while total employees were 173,000 at the end of 2019.Larger rival Marriott has also furloughed thousands of employees as bookings dried up during the pandemic."}}, {"url_id": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/lighting-maker-signify--uv-light--degrades--coronavirus-quickly-12841980", "content": {"url_label": "Lighting maker Signify: UV light 'degrades' coronavirus quickly", "text": "AMSTERDAM: Signify, the world's largest lighting manufacturer, said on Tuesday researchers at Boston University had confirmed an ultraviolet light made by the company works to degrade most coronavirus in a laboratory setting in a matter of seconds.The sun's rays are already known to degrade viruses outdoors, and the lighting maker hopes UV lights can be used to help reduce the amount of virus in indoor areas.\"Given the potential of the technology to aid the fight against the coronavirus, Signify will not keep the technology for its exclusive use but make it available to other lighting companies,\" CEO Eric Rondolat said in a statement.\"To service the growing need for disinfection we will increase our production capacity multifold in the coming months.\u201d(Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Alex Richardson)"}}]
