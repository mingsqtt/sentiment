I don't know how this place can be rated 4 1/2 stars.  I'm pretty sure you can get much better sushi at Costco and better cuts of fish at any Isetan Japanese market.  I was pretty excited to dine here since it was located at the Far East Plaza right next to the hotel so it was pretty effortless to get here after work.\n\nThe Sushi Bar is located on the 4th floor of this less-than-glam shopping plaza where merchants stand outside their shops preying on walker bys.  It kinda reminds me of an indoor flea market with roll up doors where they sell lots of shimmering cheap stretch pants and battery operated clapping toys.  I was convinced that the Sushi Bar was just a gem located inside this 1980's time-warped mall.\n\nI sat down and ordered some green tea, the 5 Kind sashimi, and the Hamachi Kama which they warn you takes 30 min to prepare.  My first disappointment was the tea bag.  I expect it from a Mr.Sushi or a sushi food truck but this place was a 4 1/2 star establishment man!  My dish of 15 pcs of sashimi quickly showed up.  The first bite of the swordfish was like biting into a cold tough piece of Goodyear tire.  There was no way my incisors could completely penetrate that nearly inch thick piece of white radial.  I quickly moved to the other fish and none were impressive at all either.  The octopus was not appealing either with the big suckers staring at me.  \n\nThe grilled hamachi cheek was the only thing that somewhat saved this place from being a 1 star. It was good but still not great.  Another thing I noticed was the lack of hygene in the handling of the soy sauce dishes.  The guy stuck his thumb right on the top surface of where people pour their soy sauce.  Some people may not care or pay attention to details like this but this germaphobe won't be returning here.

We ordered a small sashimi sampler, 3 rolls from the chefs recommendation menu, and wagyu aburi sushi (best idea ever!!) \n\nThe sashimi was super thick and delicious, but I have to say my fav was the wagyu melt on your tongue aburi sushi and the scallop roll.

I loved the rolls, but three aburi-ed rolls which sort of taste the same after a while, for 2 people, are a bit much, and hence we struggled to finish the rolls, which resulted in a fair bit of waste. \n\nWe also got the normal chirashi, a portion of salmon sashimi, a pitan tofu. The chirashi was topped with thickly sliced fish of various varieties, and the rice was sufficiently vinegared. Yum!\n\nMy favorite was the pitan tofu. Tofu is actually a misnomer as they use egg custard as the tofu, and then top it with century eggs, flying fish roe, spring onions, and shredded surimi.

The word \"Sushi\" was an immediately 'Yes' when she suggested having our dinner there, no regrets at all. \n\nHidden on the 4th floor of Far East Plaza, a mall that needs some upgrading to compete with its rivals. My first impression of the place is this must be a low cost type Japanese restaurant as its interior and menu matches to my impression but the cost of the food is at a different level! I ordered the Normal Chirashi Set (A bowl of rice with a mixture of assorted meat) that cost $24 to try out since I was told how good the food is. \n\nWhen my meal was served, my eyes \"popped\" out when I saw the portion of the meat, it's probably the most generous portion I come across in Singapore so far. My first bite of it has made me craved for more. While engaging a conversation with my friend, I can't help but to enjoy every bite of it; multi-tasking at the same time.

You can taste the smokiness of the seared salmon and it is not too overpowering. The sushi has a good balance of fish and rice. The presentation is good. \n\nThe premium chirashi is equally satisfying. Lots of fresh seafood and too little rice though the amount is just right to fill you up. The premium chirashi has seasonal items (uni, prawn and maybe others which are not included in the regular chirashi) and so is the price. Mine was $38.90 which I felt was reasonable given the 3 pieces of uni and sheer quantity of fish. I loved the aburi salmon and salmon belly in it. \n\nIt is crowded during lunch time, so you will need to wait to get a table. They lost our reservation though, so we took the counter seats until a table was free. For a small place, there are 6 people in the tiny kitchen slicing and dicing and cleaning.

Business is good so it is advisable to make a reservation. One of the speciality is the soft shell crab with salmon roll.

The Chirashi comes with an eclectic assortment of fish including: salmon, aburi salmon (my personal fav), tuna, yellowtail, swordfish, scallop, fish roe and tomago. The fish portions are thick, so you won't feel short changed after finishing the dish. My only complaint, if any, was the small layer of rice underneath the sashimi.
