The Apple MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020) is the latest version of the company's affordable professional MacBook, bringing upgraded hardware and a drastically improved keyboard.

The MacBook Pro 13-inch 2020 is arguably Apple’s most important laptop, offering power and performance above regular MacBooks, like the MacBook Air (2020), without demanding quite as high a price tag as the larger flagship 16-inch MacBook Pro. It needs, then, to keep the price accessible, while also offering performance and features that professionals, especially in the creative industry, require.

Performance-wise, the new MacBook Pro 13-inch looks promising on paper, with new 10th generation CPUs offering a noticeable boost, and the base model now comes with twice the RAM and twice the storage than the previous model. In our MacBook Pro 2020 (13-inch) vs MacBook Pro 2019 (13-inch) head-to-head, there’s a clear upgrade between last year’s model and the latest version.

What makes the new MacBook Pro 13-inch more appealing for newcomers, is the fact that this year's model has been released at the same $1,299 / £1,299 / AU$1,999 cost for the entry model. That pretty much means the 2020 version is a no-brainer, especially considering storage has been doubled to 256GB, unless you find some serious discounts for the 2019 model.

However, there is a pretty major caveat with the entry-level 2020 model; it features a much older 8th generation Intel CPU, and slower memory.

That means if you want to benefit from some of the biggest improvements Apple has made to the Apple MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020), you're going to have to shell out for the $1,799 / £1,799 / AU$2,999 model, which comes with a 2.0GHz 10th-gen Intel Core i5 processor, 512GB of storage and 16GB of faster RAM.

When it comes to design, things are pretty much the same, with the MacBook Pro 13-inch 2020 model being a tiny bit thicker and heavier than the 2019 model, but otherwise the looks are unchanged on the outside.

On the inside, there is now a much-improved keyboard, which feels comfortable to type on, with decent key travel that results in a satisfying typing experience.

Crucially, the new keyboard, dubbed the Magic Keyboard, seemingly fixes the reliability problems that the keyboards of previous 13-inch MacBook Pro devices suffered from. If you were put off by the keyboard of previous MacBooks, you can buy the new MacBook Pro with confidence that you're getting a much better keyboard.

Not much else has changed about the design, and that's good news for anyone who loves the look of MacBooks, but there are aspects of the design that are starting to feel a little dated - such as the thick bezels around the screen (which keeps the size and resolution of older MacBook Pro 13-inch models).

With some brilliant Windows 10 laptops offering increasingly thin and light designs, this could leave Apple trailing its competitors, when it once led the way.

However, with the performance of the MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020), we've got no complaints - as long as you buy the model with the 10th generation CPU.

macOS, and various apps that we ran on it, felt smooth and responsive, and the added performance of the newer CPU, along with the faster RAM, makes the 13-inch MacBook Pro a decent leap over the previous model, especially if you like multi-tasking with plenty of apps open at once.

Battery life was also very good, beating many similarly-specced Windows 10 laptops by a few hours, though we noticed a slight dip in battery life compared to the previous model.

Still, overall the new MacBook Pro 13-inch is an excellent laptop for people who don't need or want the power offered by the flagship 16-inch model, yet need something with a bit more oomph compared to the MacBook Air.

However, we must stress that while we were impressed with the mid-range MacBook Pro 13-inch, we feel that the entry level version now feels too compromised with its older and slower hardware. It's a real shame Apple didn't give its most affordable MacBook Pro more of an upgrade.
